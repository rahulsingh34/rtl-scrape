1,ABUSIVE DRITA/SABAUDIN HAMZARAJ - BON (SUPER/BUILDING MANAGER-FOREST HILL KIPLING GROUP-L5A 1W6/L5A 1W5),MISSISSAUGA,"This Abusive Couple is living in this Rental Building for last 13+ yrs as Super & Surveil Tenants - In/Out of Building, 24/7 to the level of Sickness so that People Do not Talk/Meet/Interact/Socialize/Knock on the Doors & Threaten the Incoming Tenants Not to do so as a Condition of giving Apartment Key & Force them to Sign Move-in/Move-Out Inspection Reports when they are sitting in Lobby Rental Office without showing apartments.

This Couple FAILED to provide Wheelchair Accessible Ramp (ONLY 4 Inch. high) to Parents/Tenants who are coming from Underground Garage to Underground Elevator Lobby with their Wheelchairs (& their Child/Parents who have Severe Disabilities are sitting in these Wheelchairs & Cannot getup), Grocery Carts, Move-in/Move-out Trolleys etc.

A Request was made 1+ year ago & this Couple who is Observing everything thru Cameras FAILED to do anything. They claims there are no Problems in Apartments & Buildings.

This Couple occupies a Apartment & on Payroll of Forest Hill Kipling yet they are not Removed & Evicted from Building but the Innocent Tenants are getting Eviction Letters for making above such Requests.

This Abusive Couple do not pick-up Phone when they are called for help, Do not attend Apartment when they care called anytime as they live in same building.

If they NOTICE/OBSERVE problems, they do not put it in writing & email acknowledgement & LIES that problems do not exist.

If Tenants go on Portal & Make Requests, this couple close the same as ""Resolved"" although ALL problems remains as it is like above for 13+ years.

They are Injuring Tenants/Parents who are lifting Wheelchairs multiple times vertically by 4 inches while their family members are sitting in these wheelchairs & they Injured my Spine more than 1+ years ago & hence requests for simple RAMP was made yet it is not created 
& 
the Abusive Property/Regional/General Manager issues Eviction Notices rather than Terminating this Couple who are the root cause of ALL problems."
2,LUC GENDRON AND MAGGIE SULLIVAN,STURGEON FALLS,"These two are a real treat to deal with. They own way too many properties in West Nipissing that they can’t even keep up with maintenance half the time. They spend 3/4 of their time sailing around the world and flaunting their big money around like it’s nothing when most of their buildings are in disrepair. They like to live large on all their tenants money to fund for their high baller lifestyle and when asked to fix something, they said it’s not in their budget. But yet, they have a newly built multimillion dollar mansion on the river and a condo in Florida in their budget. They aren’t the worst landlords but they sure don’t have their priorities in order nor their tenants needs at heart that’s for sure!"
3,TERRACORP,LONDON,Will do anything to jack up your rent in a 70 year old building.
4,MY RENTAL UNIT,HAMILTON,Pamala and Glen are wonderful!  Been in my unit for a few years.  They always fix issues in a fast time and treat my family and me very good.  Rent increase notice is sent out really early and reminder email sent out at least 2 months before it takes effect.  I hope to stay for a long time.
5,DSM INVESTMENT GROUP,TORONTO,"First good landlord I've had in the city. Small repairs are fixed by super in a timely manner but I can't speak to what would happen if a bigger repair was needed as I have yet to experience that. Landlords seem kind and fair, but most interactions are through the super. Would recommend renting at one of their properties."
6,RICHARD DAVIDSON,MARKHAM,"I had a landlord Richard who lived above my husband and me, and he and his wife would get into screaming matches. The wife would literally become hoarse from screaming at him. She would stomp her feet and they would both throw things at each other. We ended up trying to get out of our lease because the fighting was multiple times a week, typically late at night, and would last for hours. We attempted to contact them and let them know their behaviour was inappropriate. One time, when we called multiple times in a row to get them to stop fighting late at night, the landlord stomped his feet on the floor above us in response to the call and yelled, '**** you!' at us."
7,91 SPENCER CO-OP,TORONTO,"Always elevator repairs, bed bud bugs, broken washing machines, all apartments need renovation. Management is never in except for one day of the week, complaints are not met on time and result in going to board meetings held by tenants who know personal information."
8,KRISTINA TRUDEL,SUDBURY,"Kristina illegally uses the N12 form to evict tenants. Adds illegal clauses to the lease agreement in attempt to force tenants to do her job for outdoor maintenance, did not comply with an LTB order and had to be given a letter by a lawyer to do her job. Complains about current tenants with prospective tenants, and out right states she will be adding the illegal and void clauses in their lease."
9,ARNOLD PALMER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"I lived in 2 properties owned by this management company over 3 years.

Good: 
- it was simple to sign a lease with many friends
- place was kept clean, comfortable and safe minus exceptions under 'bad'
- regular cleaning service for shared rooms like bathrooms was nice
- they never cared that we all had our girlfriends basically also living there

Bad:
- landlord himself was never reachable once in 3 years. Always on vacation out of country
- management company would repeatedly put signs supporting their chosen political party on our lawn against our wishes
- extremely large mold issue in basement apartments that caused illness. Mold was wiped down by management but not removed properly so grew back immediately. Management said tough luck. One girl had to live somewhere else while still paying rent due to serious illness
- bat in the kitchen and managment said they looked but couldn't find it so that was that
- heat in apartment controlled entirely by other tenants
- management lost all the post-dated cheques we wrote them so I had to buy new cheques. Keep receipts for everything
- lost water for a few days due to city pipe exploding and had to fend for ourselves
- once got YELLED at by management dropping by because his wife was the cleaner and she couldn't clean the kitchen well because it was messy. I didn't leave it messy I just happened to be the one with class that morning. Also who cares just don't clean it if it wasn't left cleanable. He was very upset that there was a lot of recycling in the recylcing bin but we were allowed one bin every 2 weeks for 6 people."
10,FRANCES FAN,SCARBOROUGH,My landlord is so amazing! She's the sweetest! Very accommodating and always willing to help. I was living alone and she helped me settle in and told me where to buy groceries and furniture! She didn't have to but she went above and beyond to be kind! Thank you Frances!
11,FRANCES FAN,TORONTO,really personable! great landlord. very accommodating and reasonable.
12,STARLIGHT INVESTMENTS,KITCHENER,"There were cockroaches, bedbugs, and other assorted pests that were never really dealt with. There was a point in time when a dog had defecated on the floor in front of the elevator and it was not cleaned up for 3 days. Landlords were unresponsive to any repair requests apart from the pest issue (and then, again, it was insufficient). When moving out (on Halloween), they said they would book the elevator off but then didn't until almost the end of the timeslot I had reserved (which was booked to align with the van rental, elevator booking at the new apartment I was moving into, etc). I ended up having to carry my belongings down 6 flights of stairs to the car until the superintendent showed up. She also left again before doing the walk-through I needed to get my deposit returned, so I had to call her. She complained she was away picking up her children and said I could just sign the paper (without her having done a walkthrough inspection or signing off that the unit was NOT damaged!). When I refused to sign a blank document for her to fill later, she said she would ""send someone."" A man did indeed come, take one look at the unit, and say ""I'm sure you didn't break anything"" before signing. I took photos of all the rooms and of the signed document, of which they provided no copies. The building was sold to Starlight while I lived there, and has since been sold again just 5 years later. Any company with ""Investments"" or ""REIT"" at the end of its name is a portent of misery. Avoid at all costs."
13,MAPLE RIDGE ON PARC,LONDON,"The only great thing about this building is the cleaning lady Connie & the maintenence man Adam, they make the building a wonderful space ,everyone else is lazy & rude. I would have lived here 3 years come August currently going to court for them trying to evict me after issuing a n7 notice for a ""safety concern"" after their landscaper ""trever"" was driving the plow dangerously in the parking lot so be careful after speaking up I was accused of threatening the said individual within not even 2 weeks I had an n7 notice saying they want my family out mind you I had a new born baby less then 8 weeks old at the time. My 4 year old and my wife were witnesses to this. Apparently because his ""supervisor"" heard this threat that I apparently uttered this was the evidence they had against me. I waited over a month to hear from Ryan (area coordinator) or someone of higher authority then the office staff as leasing agent is friends with any and everyone in the building and never took any claims serious. My wife was harrased for over a month from tenants above & nothing was done. As soon as this incident happened and there was an accusation about me thats when they jumped on it. Unfortunately not a safe environment to be around when their is gossip all throughout the building coming from the leasing agent thankfully we moved out for our safety of our family as it was not a good environment to raise our children around. The office has hardly been open in months ever since the nice indian man left were lucky if it's open twice a week seems like they make up their own hours and only work when they want. Tons of friends in the buidling are having issues with cockroaches everytime theyre gone they just come right back. Safety concerns with homeless people entering the building side door has never fully locked and can enter by just pulling the door back door is always broken as well on and off as fast as Adam fixes it it's broken again due to residents mistreating property & homeless."
14,WILSTAR MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Ever since the building ownership changed to Wilstar and Ryan took over, things have gone down hill. The lower the A/C cooling(same with heat in the winter) during the day to save on electricity yet we have the blower on in our unit on full time, poor logic here. There is hot water interruptions every day it seem now at the same hours, early morning mid, mid afternoon and after midnight. I heard they are soon to be charging hydro. Only good is the buildings are fairly clean, safe and close to the subway. Another cons is Ryan/Wilstar having these terrible contractors. The building looks like a construction pit.  5 projects happening and none of them finishing. They did the garage 2 years ago and redoing it again. Why keep hiring terrible contractors? Also, what’s up with terrible pool and gym times. You sold the time to third party, who charges swimming lessons and
Yoga. I keep getting spammed with lessons. What else are you going sell to third party? Ryan, please hire proper contractors and have a project management on site. You are a disgrace and lucky to have this job. Roxor"
15,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"If I could give -5 stars I would. Absolutely atrocious. We politely requested maintenance (multiple times) to fix the wall as it was moulding terribly, we had to do it ourselves when no one came after months of calling and sending in requests (they keep saying they aren’t getting the requests, as if an online contact form could get lost) Same goes for the window screens. They have no problem demanding rent but when we ASK for any sort of maintenance, we get ignored.
I really hate writing these kinds of reviews, but I honestly think they absolutely deserve it. Please start doing your jobs Wilstar Management. Please get rid of Ryan!!!! Also do something about the smoke, do something right. P.S hire real contractors if you want work done, stop hiring these terrible contractors that take on 5+ jobs but never finish them. The quality is so terrible, cars are damaged with dirt and rust in the garage"
16,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Poor quality workmanship in the building considering how much they charge for rent. I heard Ryan wife is the owner of Wilstar, that explains how he got the job. I also heard Ryan has connections with the contractors, explains why they are so horrible and nothing gets done. Balcony restoration has taken far too long, 2 condominiums have been built in the same time across the street.

Garage repairs are a horrible fail, guess it can be considered a free car wash/shower depending where you park. Wilstar should be thankful they haven't been sued over rust damages to tenants cars because of the moisture/water issues. Highly recommend a car wash pass in the winter months or else your car will rust away.

Garage ramps are not heated and can become dangerous in heavy snow fall.

Elevator upgrades are somewhat a fail, service elevator is almost always off causing delays and electrical issues seem to be the norm every few months.

Units are hit and miss, windows are incredibly drafty leading to cold winters and warm summers. The new roof AC has a lot left to be desired, its energy efficient and weak so what's the point if every apartment has their HVAC running continuously to try and cool down. Portable AC is a must!

So much wasted potential due to poor decisions.

Location is good and units are big.

Ryan = Terrible Management"
17,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Previously rented at ******** apartment. Building has very poor construction. Constantly shuts off water in the building. Strict amenity and parking rules. Management is very rude and has poor communication skills. Superintendent was nice. Alot of mold in hallway ceilings. Especially by the elevators and laundry room. Laundry room has very early cut off hours so it gets busy. Laundry room machines will constantly break or not work as intended but still charge. Washing machines have flooded the laundry room a few times. It’s hard to say the rental prices are good compared to others advertised because the inconvenience and problems in the building make up for it. Thanks to this building I've learned to check company websites to see how often things like water are turned off for an entire day. Nightmare rental experience. Hopefully others have better luck or these issues get fixed/changed. Also there is a pigeon problem and residents have a constant fight with them taking over the balcony. You will constantly, constantly, have to clean up bird droppings on your balcony and be left with very few options to keep them away. Also we are not allowed to clean the balcony. The contractors took forever, which allowed the pigeons to poo everywhere. The contractors didn’t even clean the mess."
18,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Ive been reading the replies to some of the reviews that were left and I am not that surprised, my experience has been like so many others. While yes the apartment building is old, the repairs have not been great. I was told many of the issues in my unit would be fixed within 2 weeks of moving in, never happened, i've had issues with my plumbing and was met with a rude and unprofessional tone and comments from management. The fire alarm goes off 5 times a month it seems, and blares in your apartment for up to or more than an hour even when 3 fire trucks show up.

As for the replies you've made, you've told a few former tenants their statements are wrong yet so many have said the same things. The way management has treated myself and many others does not ""strictly abide to customer service standards"" Instead of getting so defensive and leaving comments that do NOT make you look professional, take the suggestions into consideration. If so many people have issues with your building and management shouldn't that be saying something?"
19,PANADEW,KINGSTON,Deffered maintenance. Doors that won't lock. Two different tenants had the exact same thing happen with their rental deposit: claimed they needed it for cleaning which was very questionable. Returned it to one when asked for proof of cleaning.
20,CHRIS KNIGHTON,HAMILTON,"Garage ceiling leaking for months and only getting worse, told landlord multiple times, he kept saying someone will come this week, next week, this week... never happened.

Faulty smoke alarms that would randomly go off for no reason, even when he finally replaced them after weeks, he didn't give us the right number of detectors so there were wires hanging out of the ceiling for months, gave up on asking for one more after a while.

Had a vegetable garden which was left untouched all summer, in August right when a lot of the plants were ready to be picked, a new landscaper he just hired ripped out all the herbs and vegetables with no warning. All while leaving garlic mustard plants untouched around the property.

Gutter above our main doorway was broken exactly above our main entrance so every rain we had to walk through what looked like water from a shower head, to get in or out, he never fixed it.

Asked to have the stairs by the main door fixed because we received a notice in the mail that they will no longer deliver our mail due to hazardous condition of the stairs to the mailbox.
He hired someone to fix the stairs. The stairs lifted off the cement in less than a week after the ""fix"" and he never properly fixed them

Definitely not a responsible or reasonable landlord. He likes to opt for the cheapest fix for everything that often leads to more repairs being needed in the very near future."
21,NHD DEVELOPMENTS,TORONTO,"They deserve a 0 rating. First day after moving in, an electrical outlet blew up in the bathroom after plugging in a hairdryer. Just plugged in, not turned on yet. Dead mice behind the fridge. Roaches, mice and rats are rampant and they blame tenants. If you can avoid this group do at all costs! They're quick to evict too. If you ever see them at the LTB tribunals, they have hundreds of evictions each visit but say they don't want to evict. They do it to jack up rental prices, especially after the TTC extension was built in the neighborhood."
22,LONDON PROPERTY CORP,LONDON,"Mostly stayed out of our way, but promised us a bonus upon re-signing a lease and then never payed us said bonus despite prompters and reminders."
23,RAJWINDER BAINS,ETOBICOKE,"Stuff that the property managers can handle gets done pretty quickly, but for anything that requires him to get repairmen or whoever else to come it can take a long time or might never get done. He's at least better than every other landlord in the area who rents to students from what I have heard from friends. The houses are clean and well-maintained. He's even charging less for bigger rooms at nicer houses than what I've seen in other landlords' listings. In the time I have been renting with him there has only been one problem that hasn't been fixed."
24,ALKET KULLA,PETERBOROUGH,"Hasn't fixed things that have been broken since before I moved into the place - still waiting for him to send a repair person for multiple issues and I keep asking, he barely ever responds and when he does nothing ever happens. Sent around a notice for a smoke alarm inspection and never actually came around to inspect the alarms. Basically an absentee landlord, but the place is nice."
25,THANH HUYEN NGUYEN (HELENA),BRANTFORD,"0 out of 10
Burlington landlord, Brantford property.
NOTHING gets fixed. Illegal entries, countless bylaw orders. "
26,MIRJA RAITA,RICHMOND HILL,"Just finished giving a very poor rating to a slumlord landlord who I never even met.  I had to fix everything that went wrong at my own expense.  The place looked awful and no one cared.

 In comparison, living in this apartment was a dream.  I left because I moved in with my partner closer to my work.  While I lived there,  I had my stove break and it was repaired within a day, I had the faucet dripping, a plumber was there the same day.  I accidentally dropped something down the drain and Mirja helped me pay for the plumber even though it was my fault.  The house always looked good.  Everyone there seemed to care about the place.  Good neighbourhood."
27,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Did the contractors walked away? Why do we have 10 construction projects happening at the same time? Why are these projects taking years to finish.
This place turned into a construction site? I smell corruption. Corruption and smoke, the smell of paradise"
28,JOSEPH KERR,BRAMPTON,"Simply the best LL, quick to respond and remedy issues. Kind and accommodating, only left as we need more space for our growing family."
29,SKYLINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"While no property management company is perfect, I'm comfortable recommending my building to people."
30,EAST WEST MANAGEMENT - TOP OF THE VALLEY APARTMENTS,TORONTO,"Let me make this short and sweet.
Place is infested with termites and roaches.
The property management company is not capable of running the building.
Do not trust Estelle as she is a little irrational and will not follow through with putting what she says in writing when requested to do so.
Estelle is slow on responses.
I am not sure how Estelle is employed there...I think it is a family run company and therefore no accountability if you wanted to complain about her to her supervisor.
Just avoid this company completely if you can."
31,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"The definition of a slumlord. The only person I've met in my life who I actually believe to be a *******. He sees it as his job to fight with his tenants. His default response is to reject, argue over and deny every single request no matter how innocent or reasonable. Nothing is easy. Nothing is straightforward. He employs a bizarre, inhuman, faux-legal tone in all his correspondence that is equal parts demeaning and passive-aggressive. He will pull incredibly shady tactics like listing at a certain price, then telling you that is the discounted price if you take on some of his duties (ie. shovelling snow, tending the garden), then harass you ceaselessly about not doing them to his satisfaction until you give up and accept the higher rent - which is what he wanted all along. This is just one example. He will pounce on any loophole and exploit any shred of naïveté in a new tenant to squeeze a little more out of them or be a little more derelict in his duties. 

He is a deeply unpleasant person utterly devoid of empathy. Again, I truly believe he is a ******* who sees his tenants only as income streams. Never in my time living in one of his buildings did I feel the slightest consideration for myself as a human being. I was an ideal tenant. I could go a year without contacting him, was never late on payment, kept the apartment clean and well-maintained. And I still walked away from it despising him and feeling genuine horror about the state of housing in this city. If people like Edward Roseman are able to be successful as landlords with these tactics and this attitude, something is deeply wrong. By all rights, his actions should result in penalties that make them untenable. Instead, thousands of people will write identical reviews about what a ******* and *******person he is, and he'll laugh all the way to the bank. All you can do is save yourself the hell of renting from him."
32,MORGUARD,MISSISSAUGA,"Property i lived at was infested with cockroaches and not being properly treated - solely with gel. Had to take treatment into my own hands and spend thousands of dollars for peace of mind. Rent prices are astronomical and constantly increasing on a yearly basis, but apartments are old and in dire need of a gutting. Above guideline rent increases even though units are in terrible shape. Other tenants causing problems with noise and not being held accountable for it despite endless complaints to management. Very frequent water shutdowns. Elevator outage last year that lasted for weeks."
33,ZEHR GROUP,KITCHENER,"I've been renting from the Zehr group for several years now. They have many benefits, the largest of which is service. Being a subset of a larger corporation they are well-equipped to handle tenant issues, and have lots of employed staff and contractors to help. Repairs and inspections for apartment maintenance are regular, and things do get done when asked. Compared to my previous landlords, they are fantastic and certainly the best I've rented from in the KW area.

Some downsides? It still takes a long time to get things done. Some things are speedy, if they can just send their one property manager for your location, other things take weeks to book. Definitely remind them of things if you're waiting on parts/etc. as they will forget to check on things. Sometimes with contractors too they have some poor communication, and won't be told when something hasn't been fixed, so be on your toes to remind them when things are still not working. The other main downside is that this group will ALWAYS charge you the maximum legal rent increase every year without fail. 

Generally though, great place to rent from. Compared to other landlords, of course."
34,JEFFREY DANCHUK,HAMILTON,Great land lord. Timely communication. Highly responsive.
35,DRAKE PROPERTIES (LANKIN LIVING/),GREATER TORONTO AREA,Never answer the phone.  Stephany Guarascio will enter your unit without issuing a letter. PLEASE BE AWAR
36,SARAH MCMURDO,ORANGEVILLE,"The property was constantly under renovation (with no finished projects, and odds and ends everywhere), there were random people coming in and out of the house making it feel like an invasive environment, there was never any quiet times, and she used threats to get her way. The rent may have been paid every month but she made it clear that that didn’t matter. She made remarks about threatening housing stability, and the cost of rent did not match up to what I had access to. She’s unpredictable, and does not provide safe, stable housing."
37,JOSH CURLEY,ARNPIOR/RENFREW,"Amazing human being. So thoughtful, reasonable and fhe opposite of a slum lord. He takes care of this property."
38,MULTIGROUP SERVICES INC,TORONTO,"What a disgrace of a LL! I would rate zeros if it were on scale! No repairs ever done, no replacement of washer and dryer, plumbing issue in certain apts and was told there was no heat for one entire winter after many calls to get LL to resolve. Many issues with health and safety ( smoke detectors not checked, no lights in staircase for almost a year, moths & mice in triplexes and rats in garages, unsafe front steps; no proper management of building! random and illegal handwritten notices for rent increases and when we called them on their illegal activity, illegal eviction notices were served to intimidate tenants as none of these were ever filed with LLTB. Almost a year later, a sudden fire occurred (possibly known to LL) and LL had no empathy or sympathy for tenants on day of fire but rather said to all tenants that we should have abided by eviction notice date and moved when we could. Everyone was displaced and yet he insisted we all remove our belongings asap and he then sought legal assistance to once again remove us from our home giving us 3 days to find a home, go through the rubble, pack what was salvageable and needed, find movers and  figure out whatever else we could. Oh, and let it be known, the buildings lock was changed preventing us from accessing our apts! Months later of headaches and post trauma due to complete life changes and we still have not been given info that apts have been repaired and that we can return as we have first right of refusal.
 Do not rent from this LL!!!"
39,CHRISTENE LABELLE (LABELLE BROTHERS),STURGEON FALLS,"The absolute worst landlord you could possibly have, has an illegal rental as an in law suite in her home so that she can evict you at anytime as you’re technically considered a roommate despite it being a one bedroom apartment. Installed cameras in laundry room as well as facing front door to watch tenant without consent, these cameras also record audio which is extremely inappropriate. 
Cannot communicate gets very violent when confronted and has a temper. Was caught on a camera that the tenant had set up while tenant was away trespassing into tenants apartment and OPP had to be called to the property as tenant was fearing for her safety. She is a very conniving and dangerous person hiding behind a reputable company in the city, steer clear of this dangerous person."
40,BARB OTTO,CAMBRIDGE,"I moved into the basement unit sight unseen but I had very clear communication from the start. Driving into the subdivision it’s very beautiful and quiet, it’s right beside a conservation area with lovely walking trails and a beach. The house is very well maintained inside and out and it just felt very homey. I felt extremely comfortable with the landlords and they were both very respectful and diligent. They were both very prompt in answering any questions I might have had regarding the unit and area. My privacy was well respected and they followed any regulations when needing to make any repairs or adjustments to the unit. I unfortunately had to cut my tenancy short to move to a different city - had I not had to leave for work I would have happily stayed renting the unit. Barb and Craig were absolutely fantastic and they would make anyone feel comfortable living on their property. Plus, it’s such a serene area and there is so much nature to take advantage of!"
41,JAREK BOJANOWICZ,KITCHENER,"Terrible landlord who never gives 24 hours notice before coming over (when he finally does, he’s often out of the country). There have been times we’ve been without hot water due to the heater malfunctioning, for nearly 3 days. Clearly built the unit himself and everything is falling apart… and it’s taken months of begging for repairs. Both washing machine and dryer have stopped working and took months to be replaced. Leaks under the Kitchener sink destroyed the entire cupboard. At one point the fridge was leaking into the wall which caused black mold.. we were forced to clean it ourselves. Currently our floor is lifting and we have asked for this to be fixed as it is a safety concern and tripping hazard. Nope- nothing. Anyways, he raises our rent every year :) (I’d like to add we’ve never paid rent even a day late)"
42,RACHEL ACOTT,ST CATHARINES,"During pre-move-in inspection, after we noted some clearly deficient maintenance issues, demanded we sign a ridiculous and obviously illegal agreement that the apartment was being rented 'as-is' and the required maintenance would not be performed before she would agree to sign the lease."
43,SEALINK PROPERTIES LTD & MUSE PROPERTIES LTD. PARTNERSHIP,HAMILTON/WATERDOWN,"HORRIBLE communication, do not follow the RTA at all and zero respect to tenants. Especially long term tenants in new complexes they take over to flip."
44,22 TINDER INC,TORONTO,IT’s dirty stairs are never washed and we can never find the super when we are ready to pay the rent
45,RENTALS 101,ST. CATHARINES,Christian Colombe (property tyrant) is an idiot
46,DEVCORE,CORNWALL,"Disrespectful staff. Will come and harass you without due cause if they think you're doing something ""wrong"". First day we moved in, someone we did not know pounded on our door while I was out and harassed my wife about the smell of marijuana. Threatened to kick us out if we smoked indoors, which we did not. We smoked just outside our window, which is maybe where the smell came from. They also tried to charge us for repairs on our shower which THEY installed incorrectly. Don't bother with noise complaints either, they won't do anything. 6+ hours of loud stomping and screaming above our heads is fine because it's not past 10pm, apparently."
47,LIFE ON QUEEN,TORONTO,"With all these politicians discussing affordable housing and homelessness, I find it absolutely disgusting that the Ford government has done nothing to address the appalling living conditions and management harassment David Weiss’ “Life On Queen” Westwood Management. submits their tenants through.
Saddest part is that he gets away with it over and over. The Landlord Tenant Tribunal issues him a mere three thousand dollar fine. A slap in the face to the affected tenants.
 The Toronto Star’s reporter, Stephen Spencer Davis, has previously reported numerous times regarding David Weiss, the owner of multiple buildings on Queen Street East. Operating as “Life On Queen”

For the last nine years my wife has lived in one of his buildings. For that nine years she has been promised numerous times that the various repairs would be attended to.
Jennifer has resided at one of the Queen Street East buildings for 9 years now.

When she took possession she was promised that they would be installing kitchen cabinets as there were none existing. Additionally,  the management assured her that they would be repairing the bathroom floor as it is rotted out and the toilet is literally falling through the existing floor.

The supers are constantly calling the tenants “crazy” and/or “troublemakers”. 

There is a constant change of both maintenance and management staff. Often the management company will have tenants who are behind in their rent to do repairs in other tenants’ apartments. 
With all these politicians speaking about housing and rents I find it appalling that not one person of authority has reached out to the numerous complaints tenants of these ten buildings have filed.

Hopefully, the media will take notice and assist with getting these tenants assistance in receiving the repairs and safety we all expect from our landlord."
48,ANDRE DEPAROLIS CAYLBROOKE,OTTAWA,Landlord Andre Deparolis (CAYLBROOKE CORPORATION) has zero acknowledgement about how to be a professional landlord.
49,BRANDON WAGHORN,CHATHAM,"Brandon was extremely professional in all dealings, he was quick to make repairs when needed and was very pleasant to deal with. Highly recommended!"
50,GMP PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BARRIE,"I had a really good experience with GMP, they were fast to act on any issues I brought up and fixed things in record time. I’m only rating a bit lower on health and safety because of issues with other tenants smoking in a building with shared central heating."
51,RALPH FOX,TORONTO,Most of the landlord duties were given to his property manager who ignored requests for most repairs and maintenance unless they were the highest level of severity. He lives in the building so he's always lurking around.
52,JON BAKER,EXETER,"Jon Baker is the proof why you shouldn’t let kids run around with their parents money. He thinks he’s a nice landlord, but his attitude towards his tenants shows otherwise…well his attitude is unfortunately starting to show through his employees now too. Do yourself a favour, live in a box in stead."
53,KILLAM REIT,KANATA,No complaints
54,EQUITON LIVING,LONDON,"The Resident Managers at Village West are too busy drinking with the tenants and going to the legion.
They are never at the building when they are scheduled on duty. 
Hallways are seldom vacuumed and the elevators are disgustingly dirty.
They gossip and gossip, don't get on their bad side or they will tell stories about you to whoever will listen.
They throw the assistants under the bus and don't take responsibility for their in-action."
55,TF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"We've had issues with water damage, mould, leaks and water pressure that have gone almost entirely unaddressed and no meaningful solutions have been offered.

They brought in contractors to install fire systems who left the hallways/common areas COVERED in dust and debris. I called when they had finished for the weekend to see if they would be sending someone to clean up and their response was ""Are you disabled? Do it yourself"".

Completely unhelpful, unprofessional and disrespectful."
56,STIRLING KARAMAR,PETERBOROUGH,"Among the worst property management groups I've ever seen.
This applies to all groups under the ""Starlight"" umbrella."
57,BEDFORD PROPERTIES & ESTATES,OSHAWA,"Outright refuses to fix anything and always blames the tenant claiming its their responsibility. mice are commonly found in the building. not only do they always increase rent as much as they legally can, they add additional fees like an extra $150 for having an AC. Laundry room prices constantly going up. renoviction is common. Shared halls and stairwells are a mess, flickering lights, half painted. Thankfully the times they need to access the unit are rare and there is always plenty of notice"
58,FRANCINE,NORTH BAY,"Treats me like im one her kids who can be wuestioned on things around the tenancy that has absolutely nothing to do with me. Like whos garbage in the recycling bin or whos garbage bags sitting outside the bin. She frequently arranges the bins and tells you to keep your recycling bags inside. I abide but other tenants throw it outside rear door. 
Came banging on the doors on the first demanding rent. I told i hadnt gone to the bank yet, this was 10am and it was pouring. I was just waiting for a break in the rain to make the 15 minute walk to TD. Im not even the one renting the place im just a guest and im constantly treating like the one who rented off her. I mentioned the renters twin brother died and she said she didnt care she has bills to pay. 
Francine has created an air if tension now and its uncomfortable to speak to her and she seems to enjoy being confrontational and treating her renters like children. 
She also blames dog poop in the common area on me. Its a public area of sorts and pedestrians walking their frequently walk through this area. 
There are no GFI outlets in the bathroom and some lights dont work. 
She demands the rent when she wants it and will message every month in the first telling when she’ll be around to pick it up. 
Demand you pay in cash and refuses EMT payments."
59,WILSTAR,TORONTO,Cordova = terrible. Wilstar is the worst management company. They don’t care about tenant’s safety. I have Asthma and everywhere smells like smoke. You see buds toss off the balcony all the time. The smoke comes through the vent. How is that safe? Allowing tenants smoke in their units? This is a fire hazard and dangerous. How long does it take to fix simple issues? Our ramp to the garage took for ever. My wife said the contractors were rude to her.
60,HARTSFORD PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"Hartsford bought this property which is a 55+ building & immediately significantly raised the rent. Many Seniors had to vacate. Maintenance at times takes weeks to repair. i.e. entrance communication system   Garage doors, elevator. These impact seniors & disabled people’s safety & quality of life"
61,ANNA PELUSO  ORCHARD APARTMENTS,ETOBICOKE,They don't care about tenants. They only want the rent. Nothing gets fixed.. NOTHING. There are cockroaches throughout the entire building. ANNA YELLS AT HER TENANTS. YELLS AT PEOPLES CHILDREN. THEY CHARGE ILLEGAL LATE RENT CHARGES.  THE BULIDING IS NEVER CLEAN. THEY ERASE VIDEOS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA TO PROTECT THE TENANTS THEY LIKE. THEY DONT GIVE PROPEE 24 HOUR NOTICE. MORE LIKE 10-12 HOURS.   IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS BUILDING DO IT.
62,BILL/ GULBURG INC,PORT COLBORNE,"""Bill"", real name is Nabeel- He is the worst landlord. He has had 11 supers in 10 years. The only way to get repairs done is by getting a order from the tribunal. He lies and threatens to evict anyone who questions him. I can't post the address, but I can tell you its two proprties that are side by side. One has 16 units, the other has 8 units. The smaller building has an infestation that the landlord refuses to deal with."
63,GRAND RIVER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,"Generally never see or hear from the building owners but the superintendents are generally fine... unless you have a dog. They advertise as pet friendly but dogs are forbidden from going through the front door of the building even in bad weather, you have to walk around to the back. I was told it was to stop dogs from pooping in the entrance where the owners werent picking it up but I highly doubt EVERY dog was doing that. Theres a camera out there! Talk to the actual perpetrators about befouling the property and dont punish every dog owner for it! Thats my main complaint though."
64,PARKBRIDGE LIFESTYLE COMMUNITIES,OTTAWA,"Property managers ignore emails until they are threatened, then show up at your house banging on your door trying intimidation tactics. 
No respect for the people who live in their communities that don't know any better to sue for personal injury. They don't maintain roads or tree trimming, with pot holes so big they're more like craters. 
Every year they try to raise lot fees 5-10% arguing they need to upgrade things they should have been maintaining over the years.
If you can afford to live somewhere else, you should consider it!!!!"
65,CAPRIET,TORONTO,"Over all the building is pretty well managed. However I have had some issues. We had a water leak from our ceiling (unsure what from) that has caused water damage in the ceiling. Its been there for years and we have mentioned it several times, and they just tell us they will repaint it at some point (never happens, won't happen. What about the damage itself? just repaint it????) The paint job in the bathroom is awful. Paint is constantly peeling off the walls because its not meant for a steamy/wet room, and no ventilation in the bathroom, so mold can quickly become a problem.

The building is also horribly infested with ants (common in toronto to be fair) and there is nothing we as the tenants can do to get rid of them, as they are in the walls and all over the entire building. They say they spray and treat monthly for ants and other pests, but I don't believe it. And as any place in this city, they over charge heavily. Washer and Dryer are also not in unit (one set per floor), break often, and have a usage fee ($2.75 for wash, $2 for dry.) No dish washers in units (at least in the 1bdr, idk about larger units)"
66,QINGHONG (BO) DAN,SCARBOROUGH,"Overall ok. Always mentioned when he was coming, followed up on complaints about other tenants. Made sure the place was relatively clean.
No rent increases.

However:
Did not want the temperature touched without his consent. Pest control was debatable in usefulness when mentioned, from bedbugs to a persistent rat scratching in the walls that was unable to be found for nearly 2 years. One fridge had strange cooling and did not keep food as well as I would expect and was never attempted to be fixed. One shower did not always provide hot water. Bathroom was somewhat dirty when moving in."
67,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,Bathroom had no working fan so mold was common. Wall in bedroom was not sealed properly from the elements outside causing squirrels to enter. Also had two bats but bats are nice. Rent increased by the legal amount.
68,BRIAN DEEB,LONDON,"One of the better landlords I have had. No real issues, worked with me. Did repairs when needed."
69,SKYLINE LIVING,LONDON,Rented from these guys ten years ago and they took a deposit out of my account that was already paid for. Never received it back due to having literally new staff every week who I had to reexplain my situation to. Good lesson in NEVER allowing auto withdrawls ever from anyone. Otherwise apartment was decent at that time (2012-13).
70,ROYAL YORK GARDENS,ETOBICOKE,"Terrible condition in the buildings!!
 Increasing rent but not fixing buildings! 
Laundry company increasing fees
Management horrible and disrespectful."
71,SUMAN VERMA,ETOBICOKE,"2022 June, did pipe water repair, handyman did close pipe properly caused small leaking and soak water to my floor carpet for couple days to dried it.
Mid of March 2023, my girl friend move in to my room until end Mar( time to move out) before that time, me and landlord agreed to pay $200 (taken from my last month deposit). Until now she keep hidden and seem dont want to return remaining deposit $375.
We are just rely on pay cheque to pay cheque. I hope she considered others people also."
72,STERLING KARAMAR,LONDON,This company has buildings infested with cockroaches and bed bugs and does not take the proper steps to take care of the issues one of the buildings had no heat for half the winter and it's been an on going issue for years. Bedbugs and cockroaches in the main hallways filthy laundry room and dead Bedbugs in the dryers.
73,QUALITY LIVING HOUSING CO-OP,OTTAWA,"Member-managed co-op allegedly full of nepotism, bias, retaliatory evictions, inconsistent maintenance and terrible morale."
74,"ALEX MIRONENKO, YURI MIRONENKO",ETOBICOKE,"The landlords will let you live in peace as long as you are paying your rent on time and not reaching out to them for anything. But if there's something that needs fixing, they are not easy to work with. They start accusing and then will take weeks to fix the most minor issues."
75,JOHN AND DIANE SLAATS,RODNEY,"If you fix something theyll try to charge you for its use. I think they'll break appliances like air-conditioning so you don't use it.
Godless people, Diane is the devil reincarnated. They're so corrupt they have some police offices in their back pocket, paying them to illegally intimidate people in a small town. Good luck as they monopolized everything."
76,"ANCR PROPERTY GROUP, NASSER ZABIEN, ALEX PACHECO, CHEVY PRIYADAMKOL",LONDON,"Terrible company. Cheap, shotty work. Unreliable, should get a new job."
77,SOHRAB KASI,WATERLOO,"Landlord didn’t fix the running hose in the washroom and claimed it can’t be fixed, it took him weeks to replace a broken toilet cover. Besides, when he saw the rental market went up, he tried to trick me move out of the apartment and claimed he needed to move in himself, which he later rented it out for $600 more per month. Also he charged for $300 key deposit and never return it. There were multiple spots of wall damaged when moved in and he tried to frame the renter for it. He also tries to get into rental unit often and show up at the door without notice."
78,GRAHAM SOMETHING,PETERBOROUGH,"He was nice enough but he didn't do minor home repairs. Furnace broke at least once a year and he did, at least, call for a technician within the same day, even once right before Christmas. Promised he'd come fix our cabinent and then proceeded to not fix it ever. Was relatively chill about us breaking a door literally the day before new tenants came to view the house.

Extremely hands off, only saw him maybe 3 times in the 4 years I lived there. Of those, they include the one time I caught him parked in the driveway and using our shed to store an oven he'd picked up on the side of the road and decided he wanted to install in our house (he didn't know anyone was living there despite me having picked up my keys a month before). The oven remained in the shed until we left, depsite a promise to ""be back Tuesday to bring it in"".

The second time I ever saw him was when he showed up unnanounced one night (didn't come inside) and demanded a girl who had left the lease pay him 4 months of rent. We reminded him she didn't live there anymore and it was a different girl sending rent money (always with our address in the memo) that he had happily been accepting for, you guessed it, 4 months, without question.

Didn't clean the house before we moved in. Did let us paint the walls however we wanted, and let us turn the fridge into a giant chalkboard.

Overall just a kind of okay landlord? He'll fix big stuff for you but any little projects, you have to do yourself. Never entered the house without 24 hours notice, the lawn service he paid for was awful, and snow clearing was tenant's responsibility. Didn't raise rent on us, except for the last year we lived there he informed us if we renewed, rent would be raised a grand total of $10/person for a better internet plan. We were all leaving town anyways, but $485 a month per person was super reasonable, especially for 2020."
79,CHOI ZHANG,"ST CATHARINES, ONTARIO","Choi Zhang owns numerous properties including an Apartment building on the famous British PM named street.  She is a fentanyl drug dealer from China who came to BC first and bought houses and apartment building with fentanyl drug money and only dealt with other Chinese.  She was featured in a Globe and Mail article for her illegal businesses and moved to Grimsby and bought a Seniors Home, a Mental ward hospital Lincoln Lodge. She uses Peter Batiste as her property manager agent and he taught her how to renovict, harass tenants non stop invade their privacy constantly and never do repairs.  But what Zhang did to us is criminal. She employed asian gangs to come to our apt in a basement under a Bistro. jShe used the Bistro owners to harass us 18hrs a day with constant noise then she got them to hold rave parties with drugs booze and and 45 Black Jamaicans who played music for 8-9hr straight at 104db so loud our light fixtures shook.  They attacked a 5 year old child and hit me with Uber drivers from QC with Quebec plates. We researched the owner who was NOT on the lease for ""7 Mile Bistro"" and he had charges from Sutton ON in abusing a former employer.  We had 51 incidents with NRP and they did nothing but egged them on to abuse us and threaten us.  Choi Zhang has been stopped but only briefly from expanding Lincoln Lodge to double the size.  She gets $2k a month from each of 31 mental patients and grosses over $50k a month from the Lodge.  She lives in Grimsby in a $1.2m house with another $880k house for her kids in Beamsville all from proceeds of crime fentanyl and other drugs proceeds.  She tell you to GA OUT if you ask for any maintenance.  She resorted in all of 2022 to turning off the heat in our basement unit 15 feet below the Bistro.  She will send proxy agents and contractors to your door if you complain and some will threaten to slit your throat.  Do not rent from this Chinese drug dealer thug she is 83 years old but employs a lot of people as her agents."
80,MORRIS AND IRENE VAN DE WALLE,ST MARY'S,"Shady landlords who didn't properly clean the house prior to our move in, wouldn't fix a broken window until we took them to the landlord tenant board, then were mad at us for it, and lied about moving their daughter in to get us evicted. We took them back to the board and challenged the eviction and were awarded an extension.  They constantly came on to the property unannounced, tried to make us pay to have the snow removed, and lied about the cost of the utilities by a large margin. Terrible people. Do not rent from them!"
81,DEVCORE GROUPE,CORNWALL,Repairs needing to be done for over a year in the unit and nothing being done by maintenance. Cockroaches in the building. Illegal entries on countless occasions. Every interaction with the management is infuriating and much more difficult than it needs to be.
82,GREATER SUDBURY HOUSING CORPORATION,SUDBURY,"Poorly upkept buildings , riddled with pests like bed bugs, German cockroaches, and mice ,  numerous safety issues. Extreme delays to repairs deemed non emergency.  Constant fire alarm ""pranking"" happening at every hours of the night several times every month.  Parcels and mail always gets stolen."
83,CAROL ANN CURRY,KINGSTON,"She was quite annoying with the amount she came to the house. Had a dishwasher in the kitchen that was broken and she never got it fixed so it couldn’t be used. Had padlocks on each bedroom instead of just getting doorknobs with a lock? We weren't allowed to do laundry during the day, just between 7pm and 7am.  In general just annoying, sent far too many emails, and made unreasonable requests. But not the worst landlord experience I’ve had."
84,RONG ZHANG,SCARBOROUGH,"He installed camera in the house, yes inside the house. He lets the new roommate to move in with a 2 year old baby without even telling me and now I can't even sleep in peace because the baby is making noise 24/7. He would just randomly show up in the house without even telling us or anything."
85,BRIAN TOTH,LONDON,"I was in the process of moving to another city, had partly moved out but still had lots of stuff at my old place. Two weeks before my lease ended, I came back to finish packing and discovered he'd moved new tenants in without bothering to ask me. When I called him out, he sent me a series of insulting emails until I finally had to block him. Do NOT trust this joker."
86,MARY LOU EBERLY,OTTAWA,"Mary Lou is, hands down, the best landlord I have ever had. She was wildly kind in every interaction, and willing to be very flexible on lease rules on a case-by-case basis. When we had an issue with a mole in the basement she was there next day with an expert and had all repairs done within a few days. She did proactive and preventative maintenance and kept active pest control traps checked regularly by a professional (living behind a restaurant this was a game changer). She allowed us to break our lease early, was flexible with move in and out dates, and incredibly prompt with all correspondence. I truly cannot recommend her highly enough."

90,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,I have been living in their building for 2 years and it’s been a very peaceful experience. Other than some ghetto folks in the building that smoke weed and have been raised by wolves I can’t possibly complain about anything. All repairs have been done quickly and all requests I’ve ever had have been treated with respect. Their superintendents are nice and helpful guys and sometimes they brighten my day with a little convo.
91,JEN PARKER,OTTAWA,All issues are dealt with immediately and professionally. A very good Landlord. Thank you Miss Parker
92,HARKAMAL AND KIRAN SAINI,WINDSOR,"They kicked me out when covid started as two other tenants moved out and they want to rent out entire unit to a family. The family doesn’t want to share, and my landlord doesn’t want to loose the opportunities to rent out to them and kick me out. I was not even in the country, landlord offered me to drop off my stuff at some other place and want the room empty immediately. I couldn’t come back as there were no flights early in 2020. I was on verge of loosing my job and they make me to loose my living place. All stuff poorly packed, stuffed in garbage bags, was sitting in my friend’s garage for a month. I have to find a place for quarantine and pay ridiculous price for it. They were not ready to compensate, even i payed for the entire month, utilities as well when i was out of country. For the last fifteen days of that month the room was vacant, my stuff was moved out to a garage. But he didn’t compensate for the rent. 
I was paying rent on time, 1st of every month. Never have people over, no parties or complains. I suffered and did not say a boo at that time because I was not sure who to reach out for help. I was thinking that’s how things work. I wish I could teach him a lesson and never agrees to move my stuff. I should make him wait until I come back to my place."
93,EIWO CANADIAN MANAGEMENT LTD,KITCHENER,"My partner and I have been renting from EIWO Canadian Management Ltd for 3 years now. Our building has a super independent that lives on premises. She's very nice, chatty and responsive. They maintain the grounds fairly well except being downtown does come with its downsides. They raise the rent according to guidelines and provide 90+ days notice. When something breaks, they're quite quick to fix it (depending on the trades). This is not something they can control but everyone in our building is quite nice and respectful."
94,BEDFORD PROPERTIES - MARK KNODELL,TRENTON,"Serial renovcitor Mark Knodell bought 4 buildings in Trenton on Feb 9th. 36 days later the first wave of N13 notices were handed out. See Mark is trying to RENOVICT over 120, seniors, disabled people, single parents and low income families during a housing shortage because these 4 building are the last affordable housing in the entire area and he wants to charge $1200-$1800 dollars more per month in rent for each unit."
95,MIRA NASER,TORONTO,"Worst possible landlord you will ever find. I would never rent a property from her she does not use proper steps to ensure safety or take the proper steps. I had multiple safety issues that I had to pay for since she didn’t want to pay to fix anything. She came multiple times when she wasn’t suppose to and forced entry. She has 0 regard or concern for the well-being and safety of the tenants. She makes multiple false accusations to try to get her way using the system. She tries to sell her places when she can’t afford them until she gets money for a next place to do it again. She uses independent everything as she can blame someone for issues when it’s someone she knows so she doesn’t have to take accountability. Please be aware this is not to bash anyone but just warn, so it does not happen to somebody else. No matter if it’s legally or not never let someone take advantage of you when you have rights and if there breaking them they need to be held accountable."
96,JASON ZHENG,MISSISSAUGA,"Every possible room has been converted into a room to rent, and some of these spaces are very small, despite the house being on the larger side. Most of the rooms are about the size of a one door garage, so the over $1000 rent is frankly outrageous. The rooms do all have locks, and there are security cameras, however the other tenants still have on multiple occasions stolen other tenants' belongings or groceries, and the landlord has done little to stop it. Repairs are not done, period. There is mold in all of the bathrooms. The pool in the backyard has not been cleaned or uncovered in probably years, and there is a smashed and totaled car in the garage just sitting there. He appointed two house managers to take care of maintenance and nothing gets done. He stated on multiple occasions that he ""doesn't want to come over here"" to deal with issues and this is why nothing gets done.
Legally, a Mississauga house can have up to five tenants living in it. This house has at least nine at any given time. There were about eleven of us when I lived there. Neighbours complained and a fire marshal was sent to inspect the property. Jason instructed us to lie and lied to the fire marshal that there were five people living there and that anyone else was a ""guest."" I was there when the fire marshal came over, and I overheard him lying and saying that a tenant's room was empty and belonged to his brother. Clearly Jason is aware of the law and knows he is in violation of it and does not care about the safety of his tenants, he only cares about the money he receives.
Overall, Jason is a nice and friendly guy, but his general apathy about anything happening at his properties and the whole lying to city officials bit makes it impossible to recommend him as a landlord."
97,WILSTAR,TORONTO,Why does the staircase always smell like smoke? Why are tenants allow to smoke in their units? I live at ********* and hallways smell like smoke and weed.
98,WILSTAR MANAGEMENT = CONSTRUCTION PIT,TORONTO,"Non-stop construction. The contractors took over the whole building. It’s like mad max in this zombie apocalypse. I think Ryan has connections with the contractors because I work in construction and I would never hire them. They take longer than the city for work and they turn this building into their construction site. Look at the yard, it’s all their tools. Look in the garage, all I see is Maxx contractors items. How does a building allow contractors to damage their own land and use it for storage? This building doesn’t care about safety, if they did, they would hire real contractors!"
99,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"How does management allow a ceiling to cave in and just ignore it? These contractors are known for taking their longest time and doing a terrible job. Building would be amazing if they used real contractors. The hallways and suites smell like smoke/weed, it comes through the vents. This is why my roommate and I moved out. Since we are young, we accepted it for so long. Was nice to sky watch through the hole. I wouldn’t bring a family here."
100,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"The contractors (Maxx) are terrible. They are super rude. Maxx garbage!!!  If you want to live in a construction site, come to Mabelle. The contractors made this place into a dumping yard. If you come to see the building, you will see junk in the back yard, garage and around the building. These contracts take a minimum of 3 years to do a simple job. They keep redoing the same work within a few years. They won’t finish a job and skip to another job, delaying the first job. They are a scam, they keep finding projects to pick. Someone has their hands in someone pockets. How does a building management hire terrible contractors who take years to fix simple task, super rude, terrible job and allow them to use their land as a construction site. Move across the street, you will be better off. "
101,JIM,TORONTO,"Jim spent his leisure hours monitoring elevator security camera footage. I kissed my girlfriend in the short elevator ride and he pursued us upstairs to bang on our door, slam and peer through the letter slot, and verbally harass us. When I opened the door (he was getting more and more incensed and we were scared 18 year olds) he handed me an increased rent bill. Said ""there are security cameras, you know."" The irony was that we were leaving the city within the next 2 days anyway... 

Researching his name frantically on google, I found reports that he had previously invaded people's rooms unprompted. My girlfriend went back to her home country, and I spent the last night shaking with a chair propped against the door. If you're a minority in any way, I would say this man is not safe to be around. 

He would also constantly yell at people in the lobby, and also at pizza delivery men?"
102,AMIR ESUFALI,WINDSOR,"Landlord was hard to contact. 
Landlord has no communication skill. 
Landlord is always late on responses. 
Landlord appears with no notice.
Landlord evicts based on his needs."
103,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"DO NOT rent from this landlord. Edward Roseman was the worst landlord I have ever had. From forcing us to pay for a monthly cleaning person in our lease (so he could spy on us), to forcing us to have an external employment contract with him to clean part of the building so we’d have a discount on our rent (everyone in the building has to have one - then one day he’ll say you’re not doing your job and “fire you” and jack up your rent. Took him over 8 months to reimburse us money ordered by the City of Toronto and multiple multiple multiple emails to get him to do it. Never mind getting him to remove reoccurring black mould or a simple repair. Every single interaction with him was extremely hostile and rude for absolutely no reason. He is an awful human being. He likes to rent to young people/students for short periods, make it so awful for them them until they can no longer bear to live there, and get new tenants in and jack up the rent. He’s broken every single rule in the book and is the definition of a slumlord. To say he doesn’t have an heart is an understatement - he doesn’t have a conscience. All of these reviews are accurate (as hard as they are to believe - you can’t make this stuff up.)"
104,CHIMA ONYEMA,TORONTO,"I lived above Chima a number of years ago. He was not timely with his repairs and any issue that was brought up to him was blamed on me and my roommate at the time. He only buys refurbished appliances that are under a few hundred dollars (or did at the time), so things broke down. He would on occasion stop to speak to me on my way up to our unit (he and I shared the front hall) and this would usually lead to him trying to catch me in some lie he was convinced I was telling, or berate and scream at me. He asked me questions he knew I didn't know the answer to, and when I told him I didn't know, he would push me to answer anyway so that he could start a fight and call me a liar when I guessed wrong. He also accused me of being a witch who cursed his home because I hung red curtains up in our kitchen. I didn't feel safe living there."
105,"STERLING KARAMER, SILVER SPEAR ROAD",MISSISSAUGA,"Overall, building superintendent is good at getting repairs done timely. Online portal is good for tracking the progress of your repairs. 

Management company is trying to get rid of the tenants who have been living longer and sign new leases with increased rates with new tenants. 

Often times, Marijuana smell can be annoying in the neighborhood if you want to step out on a nice day in the summer."
106,WILSTAR MANAGEMENT,ETOBICOKE,"Was a decent place to live- good size apartments, utilities included, clean, no pests, etc. 

Didn't run into issues until our ceiling collapsed in from a leak on the roof and created a 3ft hole above our living room. We told them about this in April and they said they couldn't do anything about it until July! This hole was still leaking and filled with mold- we had to call a Toronto Health inspector to look at it to get them to cover it up. 

They initially covered it with a tarp and then patched it without fixing the roof, so it started to drip again. At no point did they offer us a different apartment to live in while this was fixed.

My roommate and I moved out because this was not a liveable space anymore. They were actually showing the apartment to other people, despite this damage to the ceiling and the roof, and I doubt that they warned the prospective tenants about the ceiling or roof issue.

You're fine in the building as long as nothing major happens, but you're completely screwed if something major does."
107,NORTHBROOK VILLAGE CO-OP,LONDON,I am low income and in a co-op. Our landlord isn’t perfect but our rent is low and work orders are usually handled promptly.
108,CAPREIT,TORONTO,"This is the largest landlord in Canada and the largest in Ontario. Instead of providing an example to other landlords, they exemplify greed by doing the least amount of maintenance possible and encouraging an environment of fear among tenants.The result is that this once cheerful neighbourhood of renters is now housed in deteriorating homes. Many have left and still leave quickly and old stable tenants are replaced by drug addicts resulting in weekly calls to Police.  In addition, most of its employees are untrained and incompetent. I could give more examples. Suffice to say it is also a member of RealPac where CAPREIT's president and CEO is the Chair of the tenants committee. RealPac is a lobby group which instructs its members (most of the large landlords in Canada) on how to spend the least while avoiding penalties from governments for abrogating its laws."
109,ANDREA HODSON (HODSON HOMES),OTTAWA,"Andrea is by far the best landlord I have had so far in Ottawa. She was very quick to respond to issues that we had with the house, and the handymen she employed were respectful and good at what they did. The house was a bit run down all things considered, but nothing awful (pretty standard for student housing in Sandy Hill, particularly in a ~100 year old building). Andrea also left her tenants little homemade Christmas cookie bags, which was very sweet and made us feel like she cared about our experience as tenants. Overall, would recommend Andrea as a landlord, as the respect with which she treats her tenants with seems to be difficult to find with other landlords in the neighbourhood."
110,SHANE SZETO,TORONTO,"I have since moved from this apartment because I needed a quieter and bigger space, but Shane was an incredible landlord. The unit was renovated prior to move in, and was in pristine condition with brand new appliances. When I needed anything, which thankfully wasn't often, he was there to fix immediately. The price was great for the space and Shane was incredibly communicative/listened to my concerns. I would highly recommend him as a landlord."
111,PINEDALE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Pinedale properties continued to allow the building to deteriorate. Poor building management was hired and safety hazards were not addressed. They were contacted by several tenants in the building (including myself) countless times to address issues with electrical outlets, damage in stairwells, a mysterious putrid smell in the lobby as well as issues with intruders on the property and for some tenants years without access to a functioning/correct buzzer code (found out what mine was from a drunk person who buzzed me somehow by mistake.) Supposedly the mysterious putrid smell was later traced back to a tenant who had unfortunately passed away in their unit and allegedly had passed long ago but despite repeated reports of the smell and concerns around its cause no investigation or check was ever communicated and in my time there the smell remained for months - I had left by this time. Pinedale did not maintain the property to an acceptable standard forcing me to move from a once phenomenal building"
112,KAILASH RANEY,ETOBICOKE,He is not a good landlord. He is very greedy and cheap. Tried to make me pay for a plumbing issue that occurred while I lived there. This issue was pre-existing. I ended up having to repair it myself (he bought the part). He also hid the fact that he had parking available because he was subleasing this parking to someone else. The result was that I had to pay parking from the condo directly at a higher price. He also asked me not to talk to previous tenants.
113,DAVID GAMBRELL,HAMILTON,Let a raccoon live in our barely habitable basement apartment for months. It gave birth and broke through a wall.
114,WILLOWBURG APARTMENTS LTD,KITCHENER,"My family has lived here for a few years and, to put it simply it's a dump.  The property is covered in mud and has been this way for two years.  If there is a problem in your unit it will not get fixed, we have had to tell both the owners and the supers of our issues and it's getting ignored.  We have had ants since we moved in and they do nothing about it.  Several units have the same issue, and some were told they should, ""clean more and they'd go away."" They recently got a new super in the building (this is the 3rd one since living here) who has done nothing but harass tenants and send them ""rule"" sheets saying if you don't abide by them you could be evicted, and calling by-law on those who park on a city street in front of the building.  Pet-friendly building but your not allowed to walk your dogs on the property.  Overall if your looking for a new place avoid this building, it's just a headache."
115,MARINE LI,MARKHAM,"Very nice, responsive"
116,SKYLINE LIVING,SAULT STE. MARIE,"Rotating building managers, maintenance & plumbing requests left unanswered/unattended for 5+ months, tenants smoking inside a non-smoking building, balcony safety concerns not addressed. Rent goes up the maximum allowed amount every year. 

What is my rent going towards? Company profit? Certainly not towards the maintenance costs of the building or my unit. Maybe to renovate other units so they can charge $1400+ utilities for a 1 bedroom."
117,JIM KOUDOUNIS,LONDON,"Nothing was ever fixed in the year I lived there. 
Plugs didn’t work, things would fall out of the sockets. 
Fuse box didn’t support the kitchen appliances. 
Snow was never cleared 
Shower was full of mould and they wouldn’t fix it. 
Heat was hardly on during the winter. Most days it was 10 degrees. Some other tenant controlled it and was awful at it. And very difficult to deal with. 
Had mice. 
Kitchen sink constantly clogged for no clear reason. Especially after a heavy rain. 
Hot water often didn’t work. 
Shower would randomly go cold or burning hot. 
Nothing was clean when I moved in."
118,MICHAEL & ROBERT AGAR,WINDSOR,No major issues while living here. Not picky about tenants so shared housing with multiple renters can be dirty.
119,REVO MEDALLION CORPORATION,LONDON,"Horrrrrrrrible !
Takes months to get anything fixed
We even have an app for maintenance requests and they still don’t respond or just ignore it. Also are charging us for extra parking spot even though we emailed called and told them to take it off still waiting after a year. People at the management office quit every week because it’s just horrible. The gym treadmills have been out of commission for a few months now as well and have not been fixed."
120,GWLRA,TORONTO,"My rating looks high but that's because personel and communication and overall upkeep weren't one of the ratings. GWLRA gets a lot of bad rap and I want to say that compared to many other landlords out there, things are decent here. The basics are attended to - there are cleaners who clean the lobby and hallways daily, including holidays and weekends. I've personally had good experience with quick response times to maintenance requests even including things like asking for our cupboards to be re-painted because we had chipped them. They seem to follow things to code running regular fire alarm testing, carpet and window cleaning, etc. However, quality has gone down over the years, in terms of things like amenities being taken away with no compensation in rent, the condition of the hallways (wallpaper, carpets, elevator paint, etc.) really going downhill and in need of repair, quality of flower plantings around the grounds going down. I have been to some other GWL properties and can see that here at High Park Village, they are not holding our building to the same standards as some of their other, higher priced buildings. They make excuses for not doing capital repairs like window replacements that they have been promising for years. And, as some others have mentioned, Dominic who is supposed to be our main point of contact for things is very very unresponsive and rude to tenants. Some of the other staff are friendly but unfortunately not usually able to help or knowledgeable about some of the questions tenants have, and then we have to wait for Dominic to (not) get back to us."
121,NICK FORTE,TORONTO,"If you have an accent, the landlord will make you repeat what he says, until he feels like you're speaking English well enough for his tastes.
I quote, ""The reason I yell so loud is that so everyone can tell I yell at everyone equally"".
No guests allowed. No showers longer than 15 minutes. Illegal Key deposit required. 
Expect to be talked down to daily. Expect to be glared at. You are not allowed to be heard making noise. 
Not me, but he threatened to hit another renter. When I mentioned having a partner, demanded to know their gender."
122,NING LI,TORONTO,Great landlord very responsive
123,EDWARD (EDDIE) ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"Wow, all I can say, is I'm impressed. Edward Roseman is basically what every slumlord strives to be. Literally will gaslight you about black mold not existing despite it being in plain view. If you bring any issue up, the default response of this man is to scream incoherently and yell F YOU in response. But wait it gets better. The guy installed FAKE drainage. He drilled a hole into the concrete of the basement with no actual drainage attached, and what do you know the place flooded only 2 weeks upon moving in! I'm shocked that nothing has actually been done about him, because it seems that EVERY tenant who has ever rented from his 80+ properties have the literal same complaints. He makes you sign your lease in his multi million dollar pristine penthouse loft as some sort of weird jaded power move to make you feel like a peasant. The dude has the audacity to drive to your place with his fucking Maserati and tell you with a straight face that your mold, cockroach infested and flooded property is in his terms SPIK AND SPAN. Don't sign a lease with him unless you want to do it for the slumlord memes, lmao."
124,MICHAEL GUTHRIE,ORILLIA,"Total lack of understanding of The landlord tenancies act. Has lost an N12 already in bad faith. Constantly harasses his tenants after losing in ltb tribunal court. Refusal to do repairs. Illegal entries. Damage to property . Removal of access to vital services (hot/cold water, heating, electricity) have all been turned off either together or separately on almost 10 different occasions. Threats and coercion to get us to move out. Ongoing for over 2 years."
125,KHAQAN KHAN,OAKVILLE,"Mr. Khan has made me vow to never rent from a private landlord again. It’s clear he bought a single family home, split it into as many units as possible, with as little effort as possible. Mr. Khan put as little effort into managing his property as he did actually turning the property into rental units - when we moved in it was clear the unit has not been cleaned between tenants, even though he assured us it would be. I cannot even describe the amount of grease that was caked on the inside of the oven and on the range hood and cabinets (we had to clean multiple times before it was safe to use without being a fire hazard) and when we pulled the appliances out to clean the floor behind them there was a carpet of mouse poop like the stove had never been moved and cleaned behind. Further, within a couple weeks of moving in we notified him that the dishwasher (which was included as a feature in the listing and noted on the lease) was not working properly. He showed up within a day or so, but then proceeded to push every button on the dishwasher until it finally ran on the delicates/China setting and said “see, it works.” Needless to say we were not impressed by this response and never used the dishwasher (partially because it was as filthy as the rest of the kitchen and could only clean on the gentlest setting).

When he did request access to the unit for various reasons (for inspections required for his mortgage, etc.) he would always request access less than 24 hours in advance. We were accommodating the first few times, but finally mentioned that he must give us proper notice to enter. 

Finally, every year he would come to us with a story about how he needed to increase the rent beyond the rental increase guideline for one reason or another (sounds like you can’t afford to be a landlord then). 

It was just incredibly clear that he either didn’t know law or did know and hoped his tenants didn’t. Either way, he shouldn’t be a landlord."
126,RHAPSODY PROPERLY MANAGEMENT,YORK,Rhapsody is a racist and terrifying biased company. The inconsistency in service to the tenants is based on how long you have lived in the building. Older tenants get AGI’s and substandard service and renovictions while new tenants are wooed. CBC articles do a great job showing Rhapsody’s true colours.
127,MEDALLION CORPORATION,LONDON,"5 stars for privacy because I'm pretty sure no one works here. I know there was a property manager when I moved in, he's been MIA for over a year and they replaced him but that guy left after a couple months. I don't know who to contact because no one will return my calls. Somehow, they place notes in hallways sometimes to tell us that we don't have hot water, but I've never seen an actual building employee. I have no idea what's going on. Do not move here. There is straight up no wall behind my bathroom counter cabinet. You just see through to the pipes."
128,STEVE HILL (CLIENT SYNC SOLUTIONS),NEWMARKET,"Steve was an excellent landlord, and completely by the book. He wasn't local so he had hired property managers to be available and oversee some of his units. Steve was always respectful, and made sure things were kept in good order and fixed any issues in a timely manner. Over the years I rented from him I felt respected and content in my unit."
129,DREAM,TORONTO,"Dream is a company to stay away from, the horrifying staff at Rhapsody Property management are terrible and should be avoided. Just google cbc articles on the 33king building (that’s our neighbours building and we share management)"
130,PLATINUM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"Disgusting units. Indoor smoking is tolerated from other tenants in shared buildings. Units  teeming with pests. They lie about pest history to get you to sign a lease, then by the time you find the roaches and mice it’s too late, they have trapped you.  A predatory property management company run by textbook slumlords. Avoid."
131,SARIN SUM,NEWMARKET,"Mr. Sum purchased a two unit duplex, with long term tenants (10+ years). After attempting to illegally change the terms of the lease he inherited, and having the tenants respectfully decline, he issued eviction notices to both both units under the terms that he would be moving in."
132,PALNOS INVESTMENTS,TORONTO,"My experience with Palnos Investments differs from the other reviewer as I live in a different building. I'm not invalidating anyone else's experience with the landlords. The only comment I'll make is for the laundry room, as it's the only reason I'm in that building as a tenant of the same landlord. I agree that the shortened hours suck, and most of the time, multiple machines are out of service. I once had a washing machine malfunction while I was in the middle of washing my clothes. I've dealt with all three landlords/managers, and they were all decent. My direct landlord is the nicest of them all to me. Anytime my apartment needed something to be fixed, it was done in was done within two days. If I had a concern with any neighbours, it would be dealt with the next day.

Fighting over the hot water is what sucks about living in an old and low-rise building. If a tenant in my building uses hot water in another apartment, I must wait until they finish.
However, I brought up my concern about something else (by sending a text and a photo), and the landlord didn't reply, which was a slight letdown. The situation concerns ""safety"" but not smoke detectors, mold, or pests.

In conclusion, I grade the company a B-. There is always room for improvement for them, but worse landlords are out there."
133,TEAM MARANDOLA PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,ST CATHARINES,"They raise the rent consistently but do MINIMAL repairs to the buildings. My apartment has a constant water damage problem in the bathroom ceiling and their solution was to patch the drywall- only for the damage to seep back through. Our pipes freeze and have burst in the past. When we first moved in, our stove was leaking gas when we used it and when we told them of this- they told us they’d already known and had ordered a new stove but it wouldn’t arrive for a week. The apartment was COVERED in large holes from the previous tenants that had been ducktaped over instead of filled and there was no working shower head until *I* replaced it. There are two working washers and dryers for a building of over 20 people and most of the time, those machines breaks. We heard that another tenant’s personal property was stolen from the ‘secure’ laundry room that we had been advised was safe to store our bikes and other personal belongings and the landlords did nothing to help. On top of ALL of this, there’s a massive rat problem that they have tried to blame all the tenants for rather than admit there’s a hole in the foundation behind where they stack our garbage, allowing the rodents into the house. The only upside is the one maintenance man, Pino, who is always prompt and sweet when he comes to fix things. It’s a shame he isn’t the same maintenance man who takes out the garbage who photographs it if he deems it “inappropriate” and sends it to the landlords so we can all get an email scolding us as if we are children. 

I recommend running if you ever see a rental listed under these guys."
134,MAPLE LODGE,DEEP RIVER,"Building dates back to WWII era boarding house for contractors. Rooms 300 sq feet, equipped with cheapest amenities possible. Infested with insects. Lone repair worker is old man with limited physical mobility deseperately overworked and underpaid. Cheapest repair material possible used for floor tiling, siding, and breaks frequently.  Property manager nightmare to deal with: impersonally rude, vindictive about rent payments not days in advance, issues were met with ""take it up with the caretaker"" or ""find a new place to live"".  Pipes froze in basement during a blackout in winter, fire depatment could not contact the property owner all night due while fire protection was waiting to enter.  Rent prices were jacked up to nearly $1000/month for absurdly small living space. Problems with noise and occasional violence between tenants major issue. Landlord responded with indifferent ""take it to the police"" replies. Infrastructure decaying - fire extinguishers frequently stolen from ground floor halls. No security cameras. No locks on external doors. 

Maple lodge exploits poor people desperate for a place to live. Retirees, people on welfare, people unable to afford a house - all grist for the enrichment scheme of Maple Lodge. Landowner was never seen. Property manager was a bullying wannabe lawyer who made nurse Ratchett look sympathetic by comparison. Caretaker was decent man who deserved better than the garbage he had to deal with. 

Never rent here."
135,WHITE HALL APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"The only way your getting repairs done is if you contact the city. Many work orders have been filled out and so many people did a walk through to look at that needed to be fixed but yet the work didn't ever get done. They would come and look and never come back. 
Mold in the bathroom for more than 2 years 
Foundation cracks, basement fluided many times. Parking lot worse than Hamilton streets for pot holes. Patch job lasted 3 months. Rent increase was more than the standard for annual rent increase (wasn't approved by the board) will harrass you for payment even though it wasn't approved. Was really good place to live before this company took over. lived here for more than 10 years great location great neighbors really awful owners. 
I don't recommend these rentals to anyone."
136,EFFORT TRUST - (ONE HUNDRED BAY) Y ONER,HAMILTON,Throughout my stay at One Hundred Bay I have struggled immensely in communicating effectively with Y. Oner. Yildiz struggles with her ability to stay organized and constantly fails to meet the standards outlined by LTB laws; twisting them to work with whatever bogus narrative she wishes. Yildiz doesn’t not respect the integrity and personal privacy of tenants along side her inability to complete her duties.
137,MANSOOR VEZVAIE (EHOMZ INC),DEEP RIVER,"Laissez faire slumlords are still slumlords. Lived here for years - never once did he even visit or inspect the place. Was ""in Hyderabad"" when a serious issue with repair came up and explained why he couldn't address it.  Would respond promptly to complaints, but would ""take repairs off of rent"" and expect residents to repair them out of pocket. 

Appliances that came with the place were literally bought from 'a guy he knew in the woods'. Used industrial grade cooling system on a residential house for no real reason. The house itself was really two apartments divided by covering over a door that should have connected the front & back halves. Construction was unstable - floor warping, walls sagging, chimney crumbling. Rent was decent (between $600 and $800  per month before the pandemic).  Residents were expected to take care of the lawn, garden and snow removal at own expense. Changed legal operation from paying him directly to  eHomz corporation without notifying tenants. Gas company shut off gas due to safety concerns. Landlord swore ""it was up to code if he got the right inspector"".  Rented out to anyone with only the most cursory of background checks.  Domestic disputes waking up whole neighborhood and drug use common.  The place is quieter since the pandemic ended, but still in horrible disrepair. Do no rent from eHomz Inc or Mansoor Vezvaie. They are slumlords seeking passive income and while polite through email, they will not care about you so long as they get their rent."
138,SADIE ROSSANO (HARBOUR MANAGEMENT),BARRIE,"awful landlords, my unit is not legal, my windows don’t open, i have a hole in my living room floor and my bedroom floor, i’ve contacted them numerous times on multiple occasions (sometimes reaching out countless times over the same issues) and never get a response 

they keep the building messy letting animals in the building defecate in the hallways and elevator, and nothing done about it.

the only upside to living here is it’s all inclusive and cheap rent, but all inclusive comes with no ventilation, and barely any heat in the winter with no control of the heat yourself"

140,ORO PROPERTIES,BRAMPTON,Slumlords who nickle and dime and overcharge
141,BLUESTONE PROPERTIES INC.,LONDON,"I've been a tenant for 10 years. They've been pretty prompt to repair/replace things, so no complaint there. They do have a bit of a problem in putting up notices 24 hours in advance of any maintenance... it doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it's annoying. Overall they're decent. Any issue(s) I've had are pretty minimal, and just require a bit of patients."
142,SENDHIL ANANTHA PADMANABAN,WATERLOO,"Sendhil wants his renters to pay for repairs and garbage that was taken to the curb that he gets charged for. He talks about cleaning up his property but never actually gets around to it. When moving in, the property gets no cleaning or repairs like paint. His rent is really cheap and sometimes he complains about not making any money on the property but I feel like that is a landlord issue and he shouldn't try to make it a renters issue. He leaves you alone though as long as you pay your rent each month."
143,THANE CARTER,TORONTO,"I have rented many places in Toronto, and this landlord is by far one of the best I have ever had. His wife and him which are co-owners are amazing! They are super responsive to any needs or concerns you may have. Any problems that arose they did their best to address them quickly and professionally. They even had professional cleaners come and clean our place before moving in and after moving out. Everything is by the book and just super nice people. I would 1000000% rent with them again. Unfortunately we had to move due to forces that were out of our control , but honestly the best experience."
144,HELDERA CUNHA,TORONTO,Really respectful Landlord. Her and her son are so helpful and responsive
145,OAK STREET HOUSING COOPERATIVE,TORONTO,"I have lived in this co-op for a very long time and feel incredibly lucky to be here. I have good neighbours, a lower housing charge than I could possibly get outside the co-op environment, and a unit that provides me and my family far more for our money than is available in rental buildings in the neighbourhood. Our volunteer board and committees work hard to ensure our co-op functions in the memberships best interest, and our office staff are efficient and diligent, often dealing with very difficult situations, attitudes and expectations. As a long term member, I'm impressed with how well our co-op runs, and how much positive change has occurred in the last few years. Many upgrades have been applied to our units and the buildings as a whole. We have low vacancy rates, repairs are dealt with quickly, and pest control is addressed far more proactively than in the past. Of course, it also depends on the members allowing this work to occur, and accepting that there will be inconvenience attached. 

No living arrangement is perfect, but our co-op is by far a better place to live than most rent-based buildings. We know our neighbours, share a belief in affordable housing and a mutual responsibility for our home and environment. Most of us in this co-op know how lucky we are to have this space downtown in a busy city - generally lower than 'market rent', member volunteers who are willing to give their personal time to co-op business, and an office staff that continues to function well regardless of pressures exerted by a few discontent member, many of whom struggle with life's challenges.

I've lived in may rental spaces, in several cities, and Oak Street Co-op is a great place to live."
146,FRANCESS FELIX,TORONTO,"I lived in this place for 11 months, having 8 of those fighting the landlord and feeling fearful that she would come over without notice and assault us again or throw away our things.

We had an agreement that we were gonna rent with her and already moved in, we didnt sign a lease at that point because we had a roommate agreement with a previous tenant that was moving out. We were working on finalizing a lease but kept sending illegal leases. We were trying to negotiate.

Then one day she sends us an email stating that we needed to vacate in Two Days otherwise she would get police involved.

We were incredibly confused and the reason why we needed to leave changed over 3 times, she came over and threw out our things in the common area into the rain, damaging them.

She also came without notice often. One time she did and shoved my roommate while yelling at him it was her house and he needed to leave. I wasnt home at this time but he recorded it and got it on other cams too, we put up cameras in the common area because we were fearful of her. She her clothes off and exposed herself to him too, the family member with her called the police and she tried to tell them that he assaulted her. After showing police the footage they escorted her off property.

Because we only had the roommate agreement with previous tenant and werent able to get a legal lease with her, we had no rights and she took advantage of this. For 3 months she promised we would continue to live there, then suddenly switched. We tried going to LTB about it but due to lack of lease we were told to vacate, despite her harassment and the previous agreement.

We had to leave without getting our last month deposit back.

The place was terrible and in disrepair. Mold everywhere with wallpaper covering it, holes in walls, crooked repair, VERY dirty. It caused all us health issues, I have chronic sinusitis still even after moving out and it worsened my arthritis.

This was the worst place ive ever lived."
147,STAR TOWERS LTD,WELLAND,"August 2022 - Convicted of noncompliance with a 20 page Fire Marshal's Order.  To date, work still not done.
Has also failed to comply with multiple orders from Property Standards and the Electrical Safety Authority. 
Has left multiple tenants without vital services for extended periods of time while demanding full rent. Has refused to provide tenants without power alternate accommodation.

Tenants who stand up for their rights have been subjected to repeated unlawful entries, false reports  (or threats to report) to outside agencies such as Humane Society and children's protective agencies and have been targeted for repeated eviction proceedings. 

This just scratches the surface of the offenses of this Landlord."
148,BEAUX PROPERTIES INTERNATIONAL,TORONTO,"Older building has had very bad issues with pest control in the past and has old outdated windows and poorly maintained heat system freezing in winter and boiling hot in spring and fall causing extreme hydro bills for tenants trying to warm or cool their unit

149,MIRJA RAITA,RICHMOND HILL,"Decent place to live, no problems with the landlord, rent was very reasonable.  Never had any issues with the property or the lease."
150,MASSIMO,SMITHVILLE,"Absolutely terrible place to live. 6 different things needed to be fixed. Instead of fixing, they evicted us. A light didn’t work (changed the light didn’t fix it) both sinks were dripping and one was broken when we moved in (got told to fix it ourselves) our stove didn’t work the majority of the time we lived there. The tub was leaking a stream and he didn’t bother fixing it. Said he would send out a plumber and never showed up. And they never put the closest doors up that they said would be put up when we move in."
151,RICHARD VANDUSEN,COBOURG,"This landlord has scammed me for around 9800.00. I lived at his rental property for 5 years, he put a gas stove in the basement apartment and didn’t hook up a hood vent, didn’t provide c02 alarm, he was always paid his rent. I did lots of updates to the apartment and as soon as my spouse and I split he said he was moving in and gave me 2 months to leave. Then takes me to court and sends all my court documents to the address I no longer reside at so of course he won because it looked like I just didn’t show up. Only reason I know is because about 2 years later it showed up on my credit that he took it to a credit agency with my sin number. He is a scammer and is well known in my area for it."
152,RAY STARKMAN,TORONTO,"This landlord will skirt responsibility and try to make the tenant pay for repairs that he should pay for. He uses the excuse of 'it's in the lease' to get around breaking Ontario Law, even though the Landlord Tenant Act leasing guidelines will supersede any individual landlord lease.  If something breaks he will make the tenant pay for it even though it is his responsibility, and often the repairs are due to the shoddy workmanship done before the tenant commenced leasing. He will try to make the tenant do things like repair the mold, or he will deny that there's mold even though it is previous obvious. His properties and repairs are not up to code and sometimes unsafe, and he doesn't care. Do not trust this person and don't take his word on anything."
153,DUANE AND THERESA SCHUTTEN,HAMILTON,"Phenomenal landlord, would be over within the hour if there were any issues. 
Kept garden mowed and shovelled snow in a timely manner. 
Each apartment had parking too"
154,GEORGE HADDAD,OTTAWA,"A petty, vain private landlord. Bare minimum is done. He claims a community. But behind the scenes, he cares only for his investment. He cuts corners on everything except his property glow up projects. He is the type to supervise your moving company to make sure they don't damage his main entrance but won't shovel or de ice until noon. He hires the cheapest labour possible and is constantly pushing problems onto tenants. He gossips with tenants, telling them about other tenants. Overall, not a good person, and entirely mediocre to underwhelming."
155,ARLETA DOROSZUK,OSHAWA,"The apartment I rented from Arleta was infested with bed bugs, like the building was infested, no matter how many times the pest control came in and sprayed, they always came back. There was even heat treatments, and the bed bugs kept coming back. It was a small apartment and it took me moving three more times and replacing countless beds, and furniture to actually be rid of the problem. I was dealing with bedbugs for years after leaving the infested property because they were resistant to treatments so I was forced to bag up everything and toss a lot of my stuff. She was not very personable and was not eager to continuously treat the apartment because of how rampant the bed bug issue was. We had asked her about it before moving in which of course she lied to us and said there was no big issues, despite the other tenants in the building telling us otherwise. It was essentially deal with it or leave, so I left."
156,JHW PROPERTIES JEFF WALKER,OSHAWA,"Jeff Walker took over the management of a  building I lived in in Oshawa where we had affordable rent and two bedroom apartment. The only issue was mould, and later cockroaches in the lower apartments. We had lived in this building for 2 years prior to Jeff, I moved in with my friend and then rented out anothwr apartment when I started dating my partner. We loved the location and the two bedroom was very spacious for us. When Jeff took over the property though he pushed out all the previous tenants, paid them out and RENOVICTICTED including myself. They refused to allow us back if we left since they needed to fix the mould problem. It wasn't safe to stay but we fought to stay cause we didn't want to go. We wanted to stay but he wouldn't allow it, he refused to work with us in a way that would let us stay, and we weren't gunna pay the doubled price he wanted for rent. At the time we were paying $990 for the apartment, now those same apartments are $1700. Eventually he paid us out of the apartments which are now obviously unaffordable. Jeff is very rude and disrespectful, he has no respect for tenants. I've encountered him other times since then as after we left, I'd still had a friend who lived in the building. I come over to visit him and help with chores and Jeff knew me from before and was very rude to me, and told me I had to leave the building and wasn't allowed back. He did this in front of his own kid too, he made me cry with how rude he was. Eventually my friend was also pushed out due to the landlord not addressing a cockroach problem and trying to raise the rent without making the needed repairs. My friend also had a fridge that was leaky. All around it's clear this person does not care for tenants and will kick you out of the building to raise the rent. Do not rent from this company or this person, and if they've newly acquired your building rest assured they will push you out. All they care about is lining their own pockets."
157,SHORELINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TRENTON/KINGSTON,"Entered my unit several times for the same issue but never fixed it. A total of 4 times they said they were coming to install the smoke detector and all they did was come in look around and leave. 

I had to purchase security cameras to ensure the property management lady doesn't illegally enter my apartment as I've witnessed her doing to my neighbors multiple times. 

Property Management lady is rude and condescending. Treats the tenants like peasants. Treats us like we should bow down to her when she comes on the property like somehow we work for her, yet at the end of the day, she works for us, since you know, we pay rent and property management services are included in rent. Just saying. 

Also, they are jacking rent to levels only the rich can afford with very little upgrades (paint, floors, cabinet) but won't fix the parking lot or do snow removal."
158,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"York management buildings are run down and it takes a very long time to fix anything even if it is a safety concern IE) back doors to the building. They will take a once nice building and run it to the ground, they don’t vacuum the hallways or keep the interior clean. The particular building I am in charges $450/year to have an air conditioning unit as well as parking fees with no guarantee of a parking spot. York has no respect for their tenants safety and well being."
159,AMAZ PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"currently have 5 open service requests created 7 months ago.   sent folks to repair 3 of them in between 5-6 months after opening them, all 3 failed at fixing the issues. So all 5 are still open.   All attempts at communication with management is ignored, yet they still somehow find a way to hassle me.  Multiple illegal entry attempts via providing less than 24 hours notice.  Never respond to my requests for access to my rental locker, I've had no access to something I pay monthly rent on for over 4 years now, and they ignored my written request to cancel it.  Both onsite property management and briarlane have both shown that they have absolutely no problem with lying and breaking the law.  Have asked for reports mandated by municipal by law 354, in addition to simple request like a copy of rental agreements, and they refuse to provide anything requested.  Have absolutely no respect for anyone."
160,JAMI JACKLYN / AADY HOLDINGS LMTD / MJDOORS,SARNIA / CHATHAM / CORUNNA / WINDSOR,Jami Jacklyn of Aady Holdings or M J Doors or whatever company it is actually called or not is a scam artist of a landlord & rental company. She hires very VERY questionable people for just about anything and everything from plumbing and electrical to on site maintenance / super in tenants who are just as crooked as her. Her numbers on amounts you owe her never add up right nor are they the proper amounts you owe or are the actual p amount you pay month to month. She ignored tenants requests for repairs and maintenance that follow with a concern for proper healthy and safe living conditions. Blamed all tenants for any pest control issues that have been within the properties for decades before she even owned / co-owned them and refuses to admit  acknowledgment of the pest issues that she was more than well aware of prior to buying said properties l. Everyone in the complex and/or apartment building of the unit you rent out from her will ALWAYD knowing any and all (her pov of it anyways) of your business that you and her privately have about your unit. Regardless if it comes from your mouth or not. She likes to go around belittling and mocking her tenants to others who reside at the addresses. She will harass you and talk down to you and laugh and yell right infront of your small children and say that you’re a bad parent while doing so. Threatens to call loved ones and discuss your business you have with her as one of her many scare tactics. Asks you to request money from government assisted organizations so that she can “have a little extra cushion in the bank”. If she’s upset with you she’ll withhold vital services from you and yourchildren. Calls child services with false and extremely concerning accusations. The list goes on and on. Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT rent from her. She over charges and doesn’t upkeep or renovate any further than a new coat of paint. Nor does she have anyone come in to clean and disinfect the unit prior to new tenants moving in
161,SHERIDAN RESIDENCE - TRAFALGAR 2,OAKVILLE,"More or less a great place to live apart from some really strict and somewhat annoying rules - Can't sign-in guests after 2 am, and need to sign-in residents of the other residence - Trafalgar 1 as guests too, garbage chutes are closed for 3 days a week. I'd still say I had a great time living there because of the proximity to the college and the great view of the trail out my window! A bit expensive though!
I'm also annoyed that i was kicked out literally a day after the final day of college with no time to pack with exams the same week"
162,POOJA PATEL,ETOBICOKE,"This is a new owner of the house located near to Westmore dr and Humber college Blvd. This house owner keeps the house very cold and not listen any single complains about the property. They claims they did best renovation but in reality they are having cheap flooring, cold bed rooms (without heater) and no single window in the basement. Furnace and bathroom both at same place. And This owner let come inside the house without any notice during work time and when tenant ask to wait for some time then they argue back."
163,ANDY AND VIVIAN WANG,TORONTO,"Landlords consistently denied any repairs including- not replacing dryer after a fire broke out inside of it. 

Used extremely disrespectful and abusive language when dealing with tenants. Such as bringing up credit scores and private information as a means to deflect from requests for repairs. 
Very scary experience being their tenant. Moved out asap. Worried for whoever else rents from them."
164,PETER TO/DAVID TO,OAKVILLE,"Very responsive and respectful landlord.
I've been living here for almost 3 years now.
He showed up unannounced only once. Mostly shows up with 48 hour notice period.Never bothered alot if the rent was delayed for a day or two. Reasonable rent as well."
165,LISA YUAN,WINDSOR,"When my apartment (which was a converted garage) flooded, I asked Lisa to please get the safety of my flooring evaluated, as I could see into the apartment below me through the wide slats of the wooden flooring. Instead, she informed me that she would be ending my rental agreement four months early without recourse. I was finishing school, and only had four months left— when I asked her how I was going to find a new rental contract that would last only four months, she confidently told me to simply lie; sign a year long lease, but break it early."
166,LOUISE WALL,TORONTO,"Louise is a private landlord who preys on foreigners, students, or people who don’t know the landlord/tenant laws. She made tenants sign a lease that said it didn’t apply under the law, she asked for illegal 500$ deposit and $200 key deposit. She lied about being resident in Toronto - she absconded to BC and made her tenants shovel the walk and take out the rubbish. She failed to install a lock on the front door, the windows were broken, she lied about a/c in the unit working. There was mold throughout the apartment. Anytime I asked for repairs she always made an excuse. When I complained she said move out if I wasn’t happy. Thank god I did but it was hard and not planned and financially broke me. 
She is a psychologist in the city and takes an oath to heal people! Ironic she inflicts this mental anguish on her tenants. 
She should be banned from renting. She’s a financial predator."
167,MEDALLION CORPORATION,LONDON,Horrible place to live. Totally infested with roaches and bedbugs. You’ll see them crawling in the hallways walls. Management doesn’t care about anything and it’s a nightmare to ask for pest control or any other issue.
168,TCHC,TORONTO,This landlord seems to like making up rules as time goes on. (e.g.) You can not have a lawn sale on the property that you pay rent on. Living in an apartment building you can not have any type of antenna or satellite dish weather or not mounted to the building or on a tripod not attached to the building.
169,PAT & DIA,HAMILTON,"My building seems to alrigjt when you frist look at it but after awhile they try differant things to get you out if they don't like you or be come an Acorn member. I am an Acorn member and they just give me the cold shoulder. I put a work order in about my toilet flooding over. I hadto turn off the toilet water and fix it myself. They took 7 hours to come to fix it after I did it an hour later. They have not fix my balcony with a nial in it since I have lived here, it's been over 3 years. I have been an Acorn member for 1 year and half."
170,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,WATERLOO,"Have had great experience with management so far. Repairs are simple to request and very prompt, usually within a day. No unreasonable rules and very little disruption to daily life."
171,SKYVIEW LIVING,HAMILTON,"This is the worst slumlords I've ever dealt with. Mould, mice galore and constant bug infestation. I've had no heat in my bedroom since I moved in, pipes burst 4 1/2 yrs ago. I refused to pay rent increase until things were fixed,  we went to court... I paid outstanding rent increase and they were court ordered to fix apt issues by November 4, 2021; still hasn't been fixed. 
Building has broken doors to electrical rooms, doors open to boiler and garbage compactor, black mold everywhere and let's not even mention the lack of proper, legal handicap accessibility. They illegally change rent and are trying to change what's legal and binding in our leases. We had broken mailboxes for over 8 months, so we never got any important mail. Place is a disgrace and no one is accountable. No safety lights in hallways, fake fire alarm switches... broken doors, security non existent. It's very scary how they're getting away with so much."
172,TAO ANN,TORONTO,"Dead communication, be prepared to chase her for atleast 2 weeks just for response. Not interested in getting repairs done. As long as you don't expect anything from her, she won't disturb you..just need her rent that's it."
173,22 TINDER INC,NORTH YORK,Horrible place to live dirty all the time.
174,STUDENTRENTALSGUELPH,GUELPH,"Absentee landlord that preys on University of Guelph students who don't know their rights. Studentrentalsguelph purchases multiple homes in Guelph and illegally converts them to lodging homes without permits or regards to tenants safety. Nick Elgie (front man), will come across as respectful and nice to get a signed lease. Afterwards, your rights will be ignored.

Best to first check with the City of Guelph building department for permits or any outstanding issues on their properties before signing a lease."
175,HOMESTEAD,LONDON,There is black mold in the lobby behind the peeling wallpaper. We have complained about peeling paint on the walls and ceilings of the common areas for years but nothing is done.  Requests for repairs go unanswered for months. Complaints go unanswered. Horrible place to live.
176,DIMITRI PAPOULIAS,VANIER,Zero respect for and harasses good tenants. Tried to evict me for failing to pay for damage created by another tenant. Made me want to leave the apartment  I called home for 6 years when he took over its management.

179,ADENAT,TORONTO,"Our furnace broke frequently, with days between repair. The store below us let people smoke in the basement and entire place reeked. We had to mail in our rental cheques, and they would mail eviction notices if our rent was ""late"". However, I twice recieved the notice in the mail before the first of the month. How were we already late? There were cockroaches. When the store moved in downstairs and plugged in many fridges, our appliances suddenly didn't work. we realized that we were on the same electric meter as the store and had been paying the hydro bill for both units. When I wrote/called/emailed/faxed to try to get this addresses, they ignored me, hung up on me, told me I was stupid and wrong. We went to the tribunal and I won. They are terrible exploitative slumlords and I would tell anyone to avoid them. They also do real estate as adenat and kitchen cabinets. Considering ours didn't have handles, just holes, and we bought them ourselves, i'd not recommend their cabinets either."
180,2468380 ONTARIO INC.,ANCASTER,One of the best landlords we have ever had. Respectful family who treated us like their own family. We had to leave due to financial issues however I highly recommend this landlord and their property.

182,STARLIGHT INVESTMENTS- PROPERTY MANADED BY TRIVEST,TORONTO,"I lived in a building for 4 years prior to it getting sold to Starlight and then the duties of property management were done by a third party called Trivest. Immediately a ton of turn over in older tenants who had been living there for more than 6 + years. I found out when one the tenants was leaving they were offered a ton of money to leave. Then the never ending construction on empty units began. They left the back door to our building propped open, which was a fire code violation, but they didn't want to have to figure out how to ensure security for the whole building while the construction guys worked. This is an older building, that needed a lot of work, but they were only interested in cosmetic work to justify raising rents. The renovated units were fine, but with no real material changes to amenities, so no AC/or improved wiring for electricity. How to justify charging close to $2000 for a junior one bedroom is unbelievable. COVID hit and the provincial government put a work stoppage to construction work like rental unit reno's. The property management company did renovations anyways. Many of the workers never wore masks. And when you asked the building/landlords/property management they did not seem to care or understand what the issue was. Construction would happen till 8 PM at night in some of the units. To top it all off the turn over was high, so it was no surprise in our last year of living there, our unit got bed bugs. When scheduling to move day, I reserved the back alley for our moving truck on the appropriate day. The day of our moving arrived and construction workers were out in the back alley refusing to move. Prior to their purchase, our building had a real community feel, everyone knew everyone, and we looked out for each other. Trivest/Starlight destroyed that in less than a year after purchase."
183,EIWO,HAMILTON,This company is garbage. They don't do any repairs. When they happen to have no choice it isn't done properly. Stay away. Jenny is useless as a property manager.
184,ANTONIO TEIXEIRA,CAMBRIDGE,Terrible landlord.  No maintenance to building in 60 years of ownership.  Several electrical and structural issues have been ignored.  Property standard orders X6 totally ignored.
185,VINCENT MARCONATO,SUDBURY,"Vince owns and operates a halfway house in Sudbury and rents out illegal attic and basement apartments to guys leaving the house who need somewhere to stay. He doesn't fix things in a timely manner and wouldn't give rent receipts. When we started LTB proceedings with him he proceeded to cut our bathroom water off completely, cut the hot water off to the apartment or at least the bathroom so we couldn't shower. Had the downstairs tenant spy on us and block the heating from going upstairs and entered our apartment numerous times without notice and sometimes without us being home or having permission. He would even try to bait us into fighting him or doing something that warranted the police being called to get one of the tenants re-arrested. Steer clear of this guy if you can, terrible landlord and just a big bully."
186,GREENWIN,TORONTO,"They're fine. Maintenance is perfectly nice but a tad slow at fixing non-unit issues, but are prompt on in-unit issues. Building manager is nice."
187,NELSON COOP,BURLINGTON,"This place is a joke and a half! 

Repairs are non existent
People in the office are a waste of money 
Bullies on the board who do whatever they want.
Parties and noise all hrs of the night in the warm weather and nothing is ever done!
Place should be shut down or become city run. 

Avoid at all costs."
188,CHRISTIAN COULOMBE RENTALS101,ST. CATHARINES,I left my old place because of Christian who was the property manager. Then months later Rentals101 hires him. Wtf?! I guess rentals101 didnt do a THEIR HOMEWORK … the guy is a jerk. Thankgod i am in my last year at Brock lol
189,SKRTICH LIVING,THOROLD,"Nice room for students. The cleaning lady is cool. The leasing office people seem to inspect the units every couple of weeks, bit annoying for students trying to enjoy life. The area has everything in walking distance which helps if you don’t drive."
190,ANDRE CAUCHI,TORONTO,"Best landlord I've ever had. Andre and his wife feel like friendly neighbours more than neighbours. Never raised my rent in years, always helpful and kind, really fun to be around too when they invite you once in a while."
191,PETER CHEUNG,TORONTO,"Peter was a good landlord and respectful man, I would only hear from him if I needed something fixed and for the yearly increase which would come without fail. Nothing spectacular but no red flags."
192,RYAN ALI,ORANGEVILLE,"He lies about everything, the dumbest things. He will not fix anything to the point of having to call the town to help. He calls your family if he can’t get ahold of you, which is mind blowingly inappropriate. If you ask to communicate over phone calls. He texts you. If you ask to communicate over email, he will text and call you non stop 30 times a day. It gets so bad you have to change your phone number. His favourite line is “it’s not about the money it’s about the respect” . If you don’t do what he says he will make your life a living hell. He will call you names, call your children names and he will call your bluff and harass you to no end. Even after you’ve moved out. He owns 15+ properties and this review is actually coming from a group of us who used to rent from him or currently rent from him. Do not enter into a rental with RYAN SIMEON ALI."
193,SKRTICH LIVING,THOROLD,"I wish more could be done about other tenants breaking the no smoking rules. Other than that, it’s a nice place and well maintained."
194,PARK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"Good stuff first - decent response time for requests, great notice of upcoming work, maintenance, entry into unit. Always plows/shovel first thing in winter. Pretty clean in corridors/stairwells. Hardly ever any elevator breakdowns. Pet friendly 

Bad stuff - jacked up the prices when the took over cherryhill, for not that big units as well. ongoing cockroach problem that is never solved. Repeated visits by pest control but still bugs everywhere, see them in corridors and stairs as well as the units. 

Take it what you will."
195,"ARDAGH ROAD, BARRIE / SIVA KUMARASAMY",BARRIE,"This house was shown to my husband and I. We signed a lease and put down a deposit. We later found the house online listed at a lower price. We called the property manager who knew nothing about the man who was showing us the property, Siva is what he said his name was. The property management company told us it’s already rented out. 
As a growing family with a baby on the way we are heartbroken. We feel so taken advantage of. 

Beware of being scammed"
196,CAMDEN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT NAINA JOSHI,TORONTO,"The landlord is RACIST and a pure horror to deal with. The building is old and dangerous. They are never responsive to any repair needs in the unit. I can go on. The landlord Naina would bully us over fraudulent charges and tried to extort money. She would come for inspections and make extremely rude and threatening comments. The building is dangerous and the garage ceiling fell off, it just missed me by some seconds. Naina would never pick up our calls. Basic things like elevator use for my furniture were denied and her husband verbally abused me for a simple ask - padding for the lift. She spies on everyone using the video cameras and threatens any guests she sees in the building. The washer dryer are in abysmal condition. There was a fire in the garage and no action was taken. Heating in the units is unregulated and even in winter it is super hot and dry. You will lose your peace of mind, stay away from any of her properties."
197,EVA (ZHE) FENG,MARKHAM,"She is the devil’s spawn! Pure evil. Handed over the condo with the washing machine caked in mold - refused to clean it despite the health hazard. Refused to pay for pest control (or inspection despite photo evidence of a problem early on in the tenancy). When I had submitted a notice to the end the tenancy, had people enter my apartment after showing hours (ie. at 9pm on a Saturday) without any notice. This was extremely scary as someone living alone! Not to mention she was shockingly rude and honestly degenerate as a person. I sincerely hope no one else has to suffer what I did in her hands!"
198,TOM LAMMER/SEBASTIAN SAMBOR,GUELPH,"what a horrible slumlord! he decided that he wanted to renovate the whole building and instead of evicting us properly they just stopped doing necessary fixes to our unit to drive us out. we lived without use of our toilet for six weeks. i would never, ever recommend that anyone rent from these individuals."
199,TERRACORP KEATING PLACE,LONDON,Long time tenant had nothing but issues getting things fixed onsite manage was useless if you are her friend you can do whatever you want but if your not you can't..  dogs off lease and dog poo not picked up garbage area is not ideal
200,ORANGELIST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,ST. CATHARINES,"I have rented from OrangeList for years anytime I have had a maintenance issue it was dealt with very quickly, the girls in the office are very helpful. This company has some of the nicest units in the area. The inspector comes in every 3-4 months and checks all the smoke alarms and change our furnace filter which gives us peace of mind being a large family."
201,JEFF ZAVITZ,KITCHENER,"Jeff Zavitz (and associate Naomh Ross) are really polite, helpful, and reliable. Because it's an indie setup, expect late receipts, no fancy online payment portal, and occasionally slow documentation. But they're nice, helpful, and don't impose; so as far as landlords go, top percentile."
202,YONG DENG (105-1083 GORDON ST),GUELPH,One of the better landlords I had in Guelph. Apartment wasn’t in great condition when we moved in. Students left junk behind and landlords did a poor job of cleaning it. The apartment is quite out of date. Landlords were good at repairs. There were some communication issues as English is not their first language.
203,EQUITON LIVING,GUELPH,Has bats living in the roof/ceiling which can be heard at night. There was nothing done about it and bats entered our apartment multiple times.
204,JEFF FINNIS,LONDON,"Great landlord and always easy to reach. Good turn around on any fixes and quick compensation if you do any work on the unit. I would complete small fixes (toilet, drains, paint etc) and Jeff would reimburse me with a picture of receipts and the work done."
205,SUSANTA BHATTACHARYA,GUELPH,"Would walk into our house constantly, degrade women"
206,SEAN FRASER,TORONTO,"Sexual predator. Takes pictures of tennants sleeping, opens their mail, never repares any thing, purposely moves in drug addicts and dealers to rooming houses, assaulted numerous tennants"
207,MEDALLION/BLOSSOM GATE,LONDON,"We were promised security guards however they no longer are here. We go through staff very quickly and cannot seem to maintain enough people. Head office will never return calls or emails and our own property manager is also terrible at responding. 
Repairs can take weeks to get done. They let just about anybody rent here, if you look up this place online you’ll find several news articles about this property here. We’ve had homeless people somehow get into the building and sleep under our stairs because they’ve removed the security guards. We’ve had homeless people in the area cause mess and break into other buildings around us. If they did a better job at vetting who is renting here things would be different.
Hot water regularly has issues and you’ll go sometimes a day or two without any hot water. 
Save yourself and do not live here."
208,375 MELVIN INC.,HAMILTON,Landlords trying to renovict tenants to remove a wall we tenants want and charge 2.5x the rent. We would lose 2 of only 9 plugins as well. The other part is updated plugs and light switches and a new floor. We tenants are more than happy with what we have because we took it upon our selves to maintain our apartments and replace as necessary.
209,KEVIN REYNOLDS,AMHERSTVIEW,"We've rented this town house for more than 5 years and I haven't a single complaint about the landlord. He's been fantastic about tending to any issue we've had, tolerant of changes to the original agreement (we have added another child and pets since moving in), he's always friendly and has been unbelievably generous with us considering that property taxes and condo fees have skyrocketed. If I never own my own house, I want to rent from him until I move into assisted-living. Lol"
210,MALCOLM HACHBORN \ MARDA MANAGEMENT ,WINDSOR,many years was a great landlord even though marda management was worst managment company ever. asked me to take over lawn and snow services from mardas man. paid me for years now even though rental cost up hes sliding on repairs to many things. told me message him about things to keep him u to date. snow grass hasnt paid for 13 months no replies email phone to me 13 months. all 3 other units of the 4 plex are getting even worse results.
211,17HUNDRED,OSHAWA,"Will refrain from repairing broken appliances etc. (Only 2 oven burners work but we are simply told there is nothing wrong with it, etc.) On the other hand they are very relaxed when it comes to small damages (tacks in wall, small scrapes or marks.) Very good amenities and security; RA's always a call away if needed 24/7."
212,BEDFORD,TRENTON,Worst landlords ever.
213,KAMBIZ (CAM) VATANDOUST,TORONTO,"Was a perfectly fine landlord until the very end when we decided to move out.  

We asked if we could leave earlier than the notice date and be refunded the rent paid for the time we'd no longer be in the unit. Cam agreed so long as he could rent out the unit starting the day after our move out date, which he did. 

When the time came to return our rent, he kept making excuses for months and then ultimately stopped responding. We had to file a claim with the LTB to try and get our money back. Full disclosure, we lost at LTB because I got called into a work event on short notice and couldn't make the hearing.

Overall, very strange experience because we always thought he was this perfectly nice guy. But as soon as he had a chance to cheat us, he took it."
214,PINEDALE PROPERTY,TORONTO,"1. No matter how many times you go and complain about how bad their parking lots are and how much crap keeps falling on the cars, their version of events is always the same. It is not their responsibility if some damage occurs to your cars while in our parking garage
2. Ignores tenant complaints or issues, such as failing to answer repair requests or delaying their resolution.
3. Target new immigrants with exorbitant rents when they sign a lease for an apartment.
4. Ignores or fails to apply the relevant laws and regulations, such as failing to enforce the Ontario ""Lease Transfer Laws"" or requiring tenants to sign a new lease in order to raise the rent. Additionally, the Management places a lot of restrictions on transferring the lease to another party (such as a lease transfer from one person to another). This is because they want to make a lot of money if they rent the apartment to a new party (on their own), thus they won't work with the current tenants who have been living there and paying their rent on time for a while. They even does not rent to an existing tenant for his or her needed increased number of bed rooms to other apartment as a new lease let alone transfer old lease agreement!"
215,JUNHUA ZHANG,TORONTO,"The first time I had to pay rent was the May long weekend, and I was out of town. I will admit it slipped my mind since I'd paid a couple months in advance, I just wasn't used to the routine. Instead of saying ""hey your rent is late by ONE DAY""Junhua emailed me a form telling me to sign it to terminate my lease. After ONE MONTH. I promptly paid and she backed off. 

This happened again a couple months later, where I was on vacation and forgot to pay. The day after it was due, she texted me saying she will be by in the morning to pick up my keys. Insane.

Fast forward to yesterday (May 1st) when she asked if I wanted to renew my lease. This comes with a rent increase and she asked if I could start the new amount on JUNE 1ST. That's illegal. Had I not known my rights this monster would have happily increased my rent illegally. 

I'm sure there's more, but I'm only so well versed in Ontario landlord laws. 

If you can DO NOT rent from Junhua Zhang or 365 Property Management. 

That was as civil and objective as I could be."
216,NORTHERN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SUDBURY,Absolutely horrible. Not only is the owner (melissa leroux) been charged with fraud but she never answers the phone never sends anyone to fix anything lived in my unit with water damage and mold for a year until I finally moved out. Completely unprofessional in every aspect I pity what the owners have to deal with with her since she doesn't treat tenants with respect I doubt she does any better with them.
217,TRANSPARENT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SUDBURY,"Been with these guys for just over a year now and haven't ever been as well taken care of. Any and all complaints I have had are dealt with, when they need access to my apartment they always work around my schedule or ask for consent to enter if I can't be there. Its the first time I have actually felt like I am being heard by my landlord. I have recommended this property management company to many friends as well that have needed places and they all same the same thing."
218,STAN FRANCIC,WINDSOR,"Beware,
Refused to fix black mould house uninhabitable as a leak above the bathtub caused mould damage  and black mould in the bathroom.

Sued me for non payment of rent.

Tried to raise rent without the correct form.

Zero maintainance to his property. 

Would show up and threaten evictions.

Rodent infestation."
219,PRINCESS MANAGEMENT 10-20 TEESDALE PL,SCARBOROUGH,"1. Ignores tenant complaints or concerns, such as not responding to repair requests or taking too long to address them.
2. Target newly immigrant people with incredible high rents when they rent an apartment for a new lease.
3. Fails to follow applicable laws and regulations, such as not practising or not implementing the Ontario ""Lease Transfer Laws."" Instead of forcing tenants to sign a new lease agreement so that they can ask for a high rent.
4. Force tenants to take home insurance because they have contracts like ""Duo insurance,"" and sometimes force tenants to follow unreasonable liability amounts like insurance premium!"
220,TONY KROTIRIS & SAAVAS KROTIRIS,TORONTO,"The landlords do not care about tenant health and safety, or to do the job the tenants are literally paying them to do - maintain the building.
A recent fire inspection found 4 fire violations, because it's been a few years since they had the equipment & alarm tested. They do not do regular checks on tenant smoke detectors, or hold regular fire drills. 
They have, on a couple occasions, instructed tenants to 'contact them before calling emergency services', which is ironic because the only contact info they ever provided is an office number (no after hours) and an email address which they frequently just ignore. They also try to make whoever called 911 pay the false alarm fees after calling emergency services when the building fire alarm is going off. I guess they just expect the tenants to send them an email and then wait outside all night with the alarm going off. 

Requests for maintenance are ignored. I have asked them numerous times to fix the building's front door, which I frequently find unlatched and open to the street. 

They don't even bother to give me the courtesy of a response when I send an email, and so far the M.O. is to just ignore the issue until the tenant gives up. 
They don't want to deal with tenants, but also won't hire a building manager/super... 
I would be out in a second if I could afford to move, unfortunately I have as yet not been able to find anything in a similar price range to what I am paying now."
221,AARON DUPUIS,TORONTO,"The landlord runs a legal rooming house. However, there's many issues with the house that is ongoing. 
For one, repairs are done very cheaply and poorly to the point where it has to get redone after a short period of time or certain projects are solved with a ""band-aid"" solution. When the need arises to actually fix the issue permanently, it does not get repaired. 

Some issues I had where the carpet was dirty when I moved in and it was promised that it would've been clean but the opposite happened instead. The ceiling in my closet had water damage and it was only plastered, it occasionally chips and falls off by itself. My storm door screen is missing the glass and screen, the bedroom itself is an addition to the original home but it lacks proper insulation. 

A MAJOR issue: In the winter, it's extremely cold and very hot in the summer. He doesn't take into account that I would need a space heater which would cost more in the long run to keep the room at a warm temperature in which he then complains the hydro bill is too high when I try to keep my space at a reasonable temperature. The HVAC heating/AC does not efficiently pump the air into my bedroom either. 

Secondly, the property has had a mice problem for quite some time now. When I brought it up with the landlord, he insisted on using traps to catch them but never called pest control or used strategic measures such as not leaving the kitchen in a mess or leaving pet food on the bare floor to end the issue immediately. 

I'm aware that rooming houses are not RTA protected but the landlord insists on raising the rent by 8-12% every year; it's still cheap for Toronto but it's not worth the price where you have to deal with mice, an unclean home and the noise which consists of parties on weekdays by the landlord, renovations and loud music past 10pm. Commonly speaking, I think he forgets who pays for his monthly income and the deserved mutual respect, and privacy which he should honour to his paying tenants."
222,IAN MARSHALL,HAMILTON,"tried to charge me for rent twice... switched bank accounts and he still tried to cash my old predated cheque at my old bank account alongside my new cheque with new bank account. it bounced and i had to pay a large fee, then Ian convinced it was my fault for it bouncing, and never reimbursed me for the bank fees"
223,G&E APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"I lived at the building for two years and I had a great experience. The apartment was clean, bug free, and the property was extremely well maintained by Dave. The appliances were new and worked well, very easy to pay rent and it was reasonably priced. Any maintenance issues that came up were dealt with quickly, and the building kept getting better and better tenants. I left when they sold the building to Searock - they were the best landlords I ever had."
224,KEN AND JANET DUNN,LONDON,"Ken is nice his wife janet is rude. We lived in a house of theirs and the roof of the back room completely collapsed during winter. Walk into it you see the sky. It took them like 6monts to even begin something and that was after we asked our cas worker to write a registered letter ordering them to fix it for safety of our kids. We lived there almost ten years, when we got there they said theyre installing eves troughs, its now 12yrs after (moved out 2 yrs ago) still no eves. They order you to not garden at all. They come on the property outside and wander it because theres no fence. We had hundreds of things stolen and they did nothing fence wise. Multiple of my kids brand new bikes were stolen so we started keeping them inside they told us not to. Ken has a heart of gold, janet is coal. They told us they are gonna sell the house so i said screw that and moved out. House is not sold its still owned by them and still being rented by them. The house is shifting and falling apart. The walls are all separating at the corners, inside. Theres a basement but they refuse to let you use it. They claim fire hazard because of the furnace. Its not. If it was the wooden beams and wooden walls are also a fire hazard down there. Janet is all about controlling the tenants. Ken keeps things secret from janet to let you live normal, janet finds out hes a heavy hammer because shes in control. The house is seriously prone to mice every single winter, all they do is tape mesh around holes that fall off. They will even tell you what you should be using the back room for."
225,SANDRO MOSCARELLI / MOSCARELLI REALTY,DUFFERIN COUNTY,"Firstly, this landlord forced us into an illegal lease by requesting an ""animal damage deposit"" when he found out we had a dog.

It was an older farm house that we were told would be professionally cleaned and have new appliances when we took possession - was not the case

Roof leaked into the house in several areas, no proper fixes made. 

There was a makeshift sump pit that could not adequately house a float, so, a Christmas light timer was put on it. During rain events, it was the tenants duty to determine how quickly the pit filled and set the on/off timer accordingly. If not, the pump wouldn't turn on and the furnace would be under water. When the sump pump failed, it was our problem to replace it because he was busy, but, we ""better get on it quick because he was not replacing the furnace"". So we did. Took forever to get repaid for the new pump, and, he even went to the local hardware store to see if I had gotten the most expensive one on purpose ($200).

He literally admitted at one point that he chose us as tennants because he recognized I was a handy person and figured I could deal with the issues on my own (which I did). Shorting electrical outlets, failed gas fireplaces (which was the only source of heat for 50% of the house) broken entry steps, collapsed fences.

We took the rental because the rent was somewhat reasonable compared to anything in the area and we knew we could save for a down payment at that price. If the plan is long term rent from this partnership, I would take a good look at the condition of the property because you are on your own, if you bring up issues, he'll threaten to sell.

They will leave you alone for the most part (mostly because if he comes to inspect, he'd have a large repair list) so privacy is good, we were there 3 years and rent was never raised (mostly because of the ongoing issues) so there were some ""positives"".

He's just a Hummer driving, peacoat wearing, hair slicked back landlord in it for pure profit. Beware."
226,RYNA,TORONTO,Moved into the unit where the landlord (sheryl) knew the previous tenants had a mice problem and did nothing to resolve or alert the new tenants. The kitchen ended up being covered in mouse feces and we had to deal with them in the kitchen for the full 12 months we stayed. Contract was dishonest (claimed rent was split evenly 25% each but all of us paid different amounts). Took weeks to even take our complaints seriously. Air conditioning did not work when we moved in and kept dismissing us for nearly a month before sending someone to fix it. One of the bedrooms did not get heat in the winter. Backyard had been used as an illegal dumping ground when we moved in. Tenants were told it would be cleaned but after a month of no news took it upon ourselves to clean. When we first moved in would show up unanounced constantly. Made lots of promises she could not keep or deliver on and overall did not communicate well.
227,MCRS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HUNTSVILLR,"this was absolutely the worst rental experience I have had in four decades. 

I had to involve the town bylaw office when I needed a necessary repair to my countertop; and also to ask the Town to get the property managers husband’s business to remove glass pieces from the parking lot after my bicycle tire got a slow leak. 

The property manager has zero knowledge of the Residential Tenancies Act. 3 of many examples: she tried to raise the rent in return for the countertop repair, she  insisted she could come to my door whenever she wished and she charged too much for the key deposit.

 I also had extremely dysfunction neighbours next-door neighbours who clearly wanted the entire top floor to themselves. the property manager ignored my evidence in favour of these neighbours. The husband was permitted to blow smoke onto me when I was outside on his deck, despite a clear anti-smoking regulation in our leases. he was permitted a propane barbecue, but I was not allowed an electric patio heater. this same neighbour also regularly informed the property manager that I was causing disturbances that did not exist. rather than investigating, as is her legal and professional responsibility, she always took his side at face value and kept serving me with unwarranted N5 Notices of Eviction. She even took sides against me when I showed her the efforts I had made to try to get along with my next door neighbours, telling me that I do not belong and should move out.  Eventually, I had no choice but to move when this property manager falsely and without evidence claimed that I was a danger to others. She wanted me out so badly that she was willing to lie to the police. Had she been more professional and dealt with all tenants equally, I would not have been in that position.
I am posting this as a warning to others. If you are on her good side you will be golden. but if she does not like you, be very cautious."
228,RANI BEHARRY,TORONTO,"I respect that Rani has a lot of properties she manages as she handles her interactions with tenants respectfully and within the LTB rules.  She had a couple of repairs on our apartment that was delayed as the contractor's schedule kept on changing and supplies were out of stock during COVID (hence the 4 rating on repairs).  In general, she was good at handling the important things with a professionalism I would expect  from a landlord.  I would definitely want a landlord like her in the future.  Any negative ratings seem to be personally driven from what I can read between the lines.  Good, honest person trying to do right by tenants."
229,YORK PROPERTY,LONDON,"Hi early one of the better places I've been in my last year here, early on in my tenancy it was horrid cockroaches, ants, a single faulty elevator, I could go on. But now the bugs have been gone over a year now, new elevator and laundry machines, repaved the parking area; they've always been quick with repairs/issues
Not that I'd recommend this place; pricing for moving in now is highway robbery and the area around here is dodgy as hell (stabbings, scavenging, drugs in the lower parking area for a few highlights), and this place is aging faster than anyone cares to update it
Management has always been nice and accommodating, not the quickest responses outside repair requests though"
230,BRANDON MAZERALL,AJAX,"This is absolutely a dream landlord. We're handy and he's happy for us to fix things and even pays for materials and our time. When we let him know something is wrong, he addresses it quickly or asks how we'd like to do so. If there's something he thinks we need to know, he lets us know and we do likewise. We've had only minimal rent increases in the five years we've been here. This guy is a pleasure to deal with."
231,NIRAMAYAN VIGNESWARAN,ST. CATHARINES,"Did not complete repairs by agreed upon move-in date, did NOT disclose the roach infestation in the entire building, and hired one of the other tenants to clean the apartment for a decrease in her rent instead of a proper cleaner. it was disgusting. I moved out immediately and he refused to pay last month's rent which he legally owes me."
232,JOE TRAMONIT,PICKERING,"This landlord served us with an N12 a month after I started walking after a major injury and multi-month recovery. While we were pretty confident there was no intent other than pettiness, it wasn't worth the fight. No one moved in for 15 months after we left although he claimed his son was moving in. This tenancy was filled with little to no maintenance (ie not replacing repairing 60sqft window that wouldn't close), tantrums and rants, and repeated lies which continued into two court proceedings. We spent five years in court with this guy and are still waiting for him to pay what is owed to us."
233,XING HUANG,TORONTO,Landlord went back on promise to prorate rent if I moved out early. When I did move out early they made me continue to pay for hydro while they withheld my deposit.
234,JYOTI PERMINDER,BRAMPTON,Clean and good place but landlords have no boundaries. They discriminate and even tried to threaten once. No respect for privacy and dictate what their tenants should wear and eat. Walked right out of there
235,MANO ANASTASAKIS,HAMILTON,Truly terrible experience living with Mano as a landlord. He overfilled the small house to the point that a dozen people were living in 4 apartments. He was unresponsive unless you mentioned escalating issues. He is profiting off turning Hamilton into a slum.
236,LIVEWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"As a tenant of my residence since 2015, I obviously have a good standing as a renter. I originally rented from a private landlord who never raised the rent and was prompt on repairs. He sold the building to LWPM. We've been to court 3 times; a fourth in July.

As my unit is directly affected by the downstairs tenant such as heat, water and power I was never responsible for maintaining them. Why? The building is originally a used car lot. My apartment used to be the office. The fuse box, water line and furnace/hot water tank is all on the main floor, to which I don't have access so legally I am not responsible for paying these. If I were to be responsible, I would have access to the unit without notifying the tenant/landlord, thus these utilities were included in the rent.

When my landlord moved out, it was the responsibility of LWPM to maintain the bills. They didn't. They acquired the property in October 2018. March 2019 they were ordered to restore the power and heat.

2019 my house was home invaded. They refused to repair the door stating they were not responsible for the damage. Again, the court ruled the repair as the assailants were not known to me.

They cut the power again later that year; I was unable to cook or use the AC so I slept outside my front door and cooked off a borrowed camp stove. Again, they were ordered to restore the power and no longer interfere with my enjoyment of the unit.

Well, were going to court in two months for yet another incident - renoviction. Why keep an 8 year tenant when you can collect double the rent?"
237,JOSHUA BROAD,NEWMARKET,"Josh cut corners. We were in the basement unit, the upstairs tenants were awful tenants and neighbours, didnt pay rent apparently and did not do their part of what was supposed to be shared outdoor maintenance. 
Josh tried to have us do more work and pay more rent to cover their slack and wanted us to pay for damages they caused. It was not a legal unit, mold in closet due to poor outside drainage/ brick path needing levelling. Electrical panel was by the sink, furnace was inside a ""bedroom"" and not enclosed, carpeting was filthy on move in day, emergencyexit door to above unit nailed shut. When we complained about the other tenants (smoking in the house while I was pregnant) he got physically combative. He often entered the home without our knowledge or had his handyman enter and make changes we didn't want. This included using power tools without warning while on night shift and trying to sleep during the day. 
Unit not soundproof from the other, lots of damage hidden with paint or flooring."
238,EVELYN TAN,OTTAWA,"This Landlord had no intention of ever being a landlord.  She should have checked what the definition of landlord was before ever allowing tenants into her house.  Before we even moved in she talked about selling the propert. She kept the deposit cheque and pretended that one was not required.  She only coughed it up when I showed her lawyer the double payment at the onset of the lease.  She tried numerous times to evict us without cause.  She failed at every attempt to fix things that went wrong with the house.  We had no warm water for months.  She treated us like servants rather than law-abiding tenants.  We loved living in her house and were friends with ALL neighbours, until she successfully made us leave.  We still can't believe that we fell for her bogus story of needing a place to live for herself.  After 10 months she still has not moved in.  It is unbelievable that a person like this gets away with treating ""amazing"" tenants the way she does."
239,ANDRA NICOLESCU,KITCHENER,"An absolutely awful renting experience, with virtually no privacy and a lack of respect throughout. Security cameras throughout the space to ensure that even activities like making food or doing laundry are monitored. Extremely particular about tenant habits and practices but leaves her spaces in disgusting states (drains were frequently clogged with her hair). Repairs were usually quick, but this was more a byproduct of it being her house than any genuine concern. I was abruptly asked to leave mid-lease and later discovered it was her attempt to swiftly jump up her rental rate. The worst renting experience I have ever had."
240,INNA PAK,TORONTO,"Inna owns many properties and was a great landlord until our Toronto condo (which was partially under construction) fully opened. Fees went up as amenities opened and she tried to up the rent before the lease was up. 
Upon leaving she withheld the deposit for wear and tear. We had lived there 2.5yrs, first inhabitants of the space and the ebony hardwood had some scuff from wear as well as sun damage from the floor to ceiling wall to wall window. Inna did not provide curtains. The walls were painted that builder grade matte thin paint and had a bit of wear since you can't wash them and some small holes from art and 1 shelf. Perfectly normal wear and tear. We were not allowed to paint other than white so opted not to spend our money on a space we knew wasn't our forever. 
We had to deliver the keys to her in Markham instead of her coming to the property (that had security/doormen we could have left it with). 
We did damage a mirrored door on move out and told her to keep the deposit as a result. But she wanted to charge extra for wear and tear. She never did an inspection or entered the property the entire time we lived there. We dealt with the building management for repairs and she never made that more difficult than it needed to be. We did not have access to additional parking or storage, but wasn't a big deal for us."
241,FRONTENAC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"Frontenac has amazing tenant to landlord communication skills. Lots of false promises though. You WILL have to follow up on missed obligations for repairs. They will also happily raise rent EVERY SINGLE YEAR, regardless of outstanding repair obligations, with 0 justifications outside of ""the government allows X percent annually"". You won't go wrong with Frontenac, just remember at the end of the day, they're a property management company completely on the building owners side."
242,DENISE ZHAO,GUELPH,"Denise will ask for illegal key/cleaning deposits for every new tenant even after being informed that it is illegal to ask for them in Ontario. She will visit the apartment without warning and sometimes drive by to nit pick about the temperature you keep the house at, or stuff you have in your windows. She will has not honoured the RTA when it comes to allowing tenants to go month-to-month and insists on knowing by December if you plant to re-sign the lease in May. Arguing with her on the legality of this has not proven fruitful. She is, at least, responsive and helpful when you request repairs etc."
243,GREENWIN,TORONTO,LONGTERM RESIDENT AND HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE MANAGEMENT. THE OFFICE STAFF HAVE BEEN HELPFUL . ONLINE SERVICE CALLS ARE DEALT WITH IN A TIMLEY MANNER.
244,WHITEHALL APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"We've had mould for years, repairs gone unfixed for years. A rent increase of around 5% when nothing's been fixed in 10 years. Don't seem to want to hire anyone to do any actual work"
245,RHONDA AND JOHN GUY,KITCHENER,"John and Rhonda have been nothing but lovely. We have had to wait for a few repairs, but when they do come, the result is sometimes beyond expectations."
246,SUZANNE AND ALLAN YOUNG,OTTAWA,"Failed to maintain hot water pluming resulting in high utility bills. Repairs were sub-standard. Arbitrarily evicted and harassed, offered no financial restitution. Threatened to not use them as references or else. Often showed up to premises without proper notice. Would not allow a visiting or permanent pet. Would not allow additional occupants."
247,DMITRI ANDREWS,TORONTO,"I have several complaints about this landlord. After a year of living in the waterfront condo he owned, Dmitri asked me to pay more rent than he was legally allowed to ask for (this is a rent-controlled condo). He asked me to vacate if I was not willing to pay the illegal amount. Once there was a bed bug issue in the place (which landlords are supposed to take care of). He made me pay for it.  

He also did not return the key deposit ($600) when I moved out even though I returned the keys and left the place in good shape. He just stopped picking up my calls or answering texts when I called him about the deposit. So, I had to register a complaint against him with the Rental Enforcement Unit (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing). They sent him several notices which he did not respond to. Finally, they sent him a notice that said he has to appear in court if he doesn't return the deposit. That was when he returned the deposit. 

It was generally stressful to deal with him. He would not give proper notice before visiting the place (landlords are supposed to give 24 hours notice). I am glad I moved out of his place."
248,FOREST HILL KIPLING GROUP/GALAXY REAL ESTATE CORE ONT (RECEIVES RENT CHEQUE/PAYMENTS).,MISSISSAUGA,"Michael Nooldeman is the Property Manager of above Properties and Knowingly and Deliberately Maintains Disturbing Environments in and around the Apartments thru Malfunctioning Pipes/Plumbing/Mechanical and Structural issues so that the Residents DO NOT LIVE IN PEACE and remains Disturbed in their living spaces and Unable to Sleep. The Agenda is this Manager is that Residents/Tenants DO NOT GET Comfortable in their Apartments but just spend some time and then leave so that he can Increase the Rent. He is fully aware of ALL the problems and their causes but REFUSED to fix them because he has to Open the Wall/Ceiling to do so and it will require Contractors.

He himself acknowledges that he will not be able to Tolerate and Live in such Disturbing Environments in and around the Apartments yet he Deliberately and Knowingly creates and maintains such living conditions so that Residents/Tenants get fed-up and leave and then he can Increase the Rent/Parking and Demand for Water as well when the Water Supply is blocked every week and hot water goes away in the night and during the day unpredictably.

He issues, EVICTION NOTICES as convenient to him rather than fixing the problems and he PROMOTES ABUSE thru Onsite Couple - Building Manager/Super while he sites somewhere in his office.

He continues to make Residents/Tenants life Difficult and hurting their Health/Sleep/Well-Being and Crippling their Day-to-Day Routine and Rest/Peace in Apartment space for which Residents are Paying RENT ON TIME.

He says that any Repairs will Damage Wall/Ceiling/Floor (something that happens as part of Maintenance) hence he will NOT REPAIR anything but rather have Tenants Suffer and if they cannot TOLERATE, they can Leave, or he will issue EVICTION NOTICES.

Forest Hill Kipling Staff ONSITE/OFF SITE are harming Residents while Maintaining their Employment & Contracts. They FAILED to Terminate the Couple living in the Building for 13+ years, who claims that they do not know about any problems."
249,SYLVIE KHEDERLARIAN,OTTAWA,"Sylview is an awesome landlady who's seriously the nicest one I've ever had! She's got everything you'd want in a landlord: super professional, super kind, and always ready to help us out. Since I moved in, she's been totally on the ball with fixing things up and answering any questions I have. And she's made sure that living in her building is just really nice all around. She's really just a great person.

But what I love most about her is that she really gets where we're coming from as tenants. She takes the time to know us and what we're all about, and she's always there to lend a hand or an ear if we need it. I feel really lucky to have such a cool and caring landlady, and I definitely recommend her to anyone who wants a great place to live with a great landlord. Thanks for being awesome!"
250,COMPTEN MANAGEMENT INC,NORTH YORK,Nickle and dime you for everything and don't really care about the aesthetics of the building whatsoever but otherwise ok.
251,THE EFFORT TRUST,KITCHENER,"Terrible supers in the buildings. 3 supers in the buildings, 2 of the the first 3 were fired for physically assaulting a family member. 1 super left followed me out of the building, threatening me, and telling me I'm not welcome in the building - had to call the police on them. 2 new supers - both physically incapable of completing even the simplest of tasks like cleaning common areas. When I was moving out, 1 super came with people for a showing (12 hour window they could come, no other notice), stated wasn't dressed and to wait a moment, came in any way while undressed and screamed they could come in whenever they wanted. Terrible management if you ever have to deal with them - threaten to evict you if you don't like something."
252,GERRY,NIAGARA FALLS,"19 unit townhouse. What a joke. Un safe wiring, un safe outlets, parking lot has more craters than the moon. Literally chunks of asphalt laying around. On site super who does nothing unless landlords around. Garbage laying around. Garbage bin surrounded by a lake of water and mud. Unplated cars, no designated parking spots but hey, pay $30 a month for parking."
253,DYLAN RILEY,WATERLOO,My landlord is Dylan Riley and he is so impatient and always uses filthy language while talking and everytime he comes home without any notice and even opens personal room doors when I am not there and no responsibility is taken on peat control and heating is worst and air condition is not there at all and when asked he always says fix yourself in a very unpolite way.
254,MARCUS MARES,GUELPH,"Marcus and Erin are nice but neglectful. 

For example they left us without a working lock on our front door for over a month. Despite several texts to fix the toilet it took them 3 months to even come see. 
On the month a single person occupied the residence they claimed 200$ over budget for utilities. Over all they are respectful but get ready to deal with things on your own."
255,KIRK CHENEY,TORONTO,"When I lived here we had an insane mice problem that the LL did nothing about. We begged him to hire an exterminator and all he did was buy dollar store mouse traps. When we complained, he threatened to raise our rent. When told he couldn't just do that unilaterally, he went on an extended rant and called us ungrateful. Terrible, terrible LL"
256,THOMAS HEITZ AND CRYSTAL SEQUEIRA,TORONTO,Gaslights tenants if things do not go their way and makes rules out of thin air. Has entered my unit twice without informing in 24 hours or more. Only thing they do right is hire a contractor in a reasonable manner for repairs.
257,CLG,GUELPH,There is trash everywhere
258,GOLDSEAL MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"No friendly management, not friendly staff. No well keep it building. Expensive and old units.
You must paid the first, if you pay the second you have to pay a fine. After 2 times paying late, you get a eviction note. But if you need any reparation, you must to wait minimum 2 weeks.  Horrible."
259,PROPERTY LINK,GUELPH,They are slightly disorganized. It only makes problems for them though. Like 4 times they came by with no key to our unit. Lol
260,LUCIANO TOICH,GUELPH,"Just didn’t care. We were below the class level of his usual tenants, so we were nothing."
261,WESTBURY RENTAL RESIDENCES,TORONTO,"This landlord is sub par, and I should know. I’ve lived here for decades because of the “location, location, location.”"
262,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"I rented with this company for 2 years. The rent was below market, but in my experience, they do not care at all about their tenants. 

At the time I moved in, I had concerns about the cleanliness, the representative told me if I don't want it, they will rent it to someone else. 

The humidity was at 98% when I moved in. This resulted in mold. I was forced to purchase a dehumidifier to keep the space livable. 

I had several concerns throughout my tenancy, the only ones that were addressed were the broken water heater and the mice infestation. 

If you're looking for cheap rent and are okay with being treated poorly and doing everything yourself then you may be OK with this company. Otherwise I would not reccomend."
263,COX INVESTMENTS,ST. CATHARINES,"Moved in March 2022.   Utterly neglectful in responding to issues and fixing disrepair in a timely manner.  Dishwasher was broken when I moved in; new one delivered and it took 2.5 MONTHS to install as it sat in a box in my living room.   The central air that is IN my lease broke June 2022 and has YET to be fixed; most attempts to discuss the status of repair have been continuously and blatantly ignored.   The countless bags of opened garbage, bikes, debris, drug use paraphernalia etc from another unit piled up outside our doors bringing with it rats etc  - with PROMISES that it would be cleaned up  - took over FIVE MONTHS before it was actually done.    A motion light was installed incorrectly; after repeated texts (mostly ignored outright) and TWO MONTHS later there is STILL no update as to when it will be replaced.  Too many other incidents to list.  Very, incredibly poorly managed.  Unbelievably disappointed living there.   Still unsure if the blame lies solely on the property management teams' absolute negligence or if it's the current owner of the building.  Either way, it's disgracefully run."
264,SHELDON RAKOWSKY,TORONTO,"Harrassed the security of the building everyday to ask for information about me instead of getting in contact with me through my emails which he had to contact me along with my number. Should have known rights would be violated from the beginning when Sheldon Rakowsky asked for 6 months rent up front on a Draft of a total of 11,900.00 and the next 6 months on post dated cheques. After the first year, rent was covered on post dated cheques and he didn't give me a new rental agreement for the next years and it got in the way of government documentation by making it difficult to get IDs renewed with the address and student information verified. Sheldon Rakowsky has also evicted me without warning or notice and there was nothing I could do about it, they only gave me 3 days to get my belongings and I was to get in touch with an agent to get access to my stuff within those 3 days. I tried to get in contact and was ignored, the next day his agent got back to me to tell me within the last 3 days my belongings were removed because I missed the window to get them. "
265,YANG-SOOK LEE CHOI,PARIS,Slow to do repairs and when finished they're done shoddily. Previous tenants got very sick and I'm worried about both mold and the pipes. They also decided to move back to Korea and haven't made any formal announcements or arrangements with tenants.
266,MUHAMMAD USMAN AZIZ,NEWMARKET,"On first inspection of the unit, prior to signing rental agreement, we noted the steps outside were in a state of disrepair and there was no railing on the interior stairs (8+ stairs), he said this would be fixed. 2.5 years later we moved out and they were still not fixed. The outside door's sealing was broken and even after multiple emails nothing was done about it, leaving cold air coming into the apartment on windy days. Toilet wouldn't always flush fully the first time, we noted this a month into our stay, plumber came by said it needs to be replaced, it did not get replaced. He was good about the mouse problem, gave us traps to deal with it. He was good about privacy until we gave our 2 month's notice. We moved out mostly by the beginning of the 2nd month (we still had some personal items in the apartment), and as soon as we weren't there constantly there, he stopped notifying us of entry to our suite, let cleaners in without notice and we would not have known if we had not stopped by to pick up more items. In lease charged a parking fee in the other fees section instead of the marked location as a tax cut. Fought over snow removal, stated it was tenant's duty and disagreed with us over it, we eventually went to the landlord and tenant board before he capitulated and got snow removal services for our only entrance to the building. Wanted to be a friend and have friendly language used when emailed or texted but generally was frustrating to talk to and get to understand the issues. Asked inappropriate questions of us (whether we were planning on having kids) and of our references (whether we were dating)."
267,THE MACDANE GROUP OF COMPANIES,PORT HOPE,"This building is listed as a ""luxury"" building when it is the opposite. Units are falling apart, the building is quick fix this and that. A lot of tenants have waited years for emergent repairs within units to be ignored and given excuses. Bed bug and ant problems have been out of control for years because its always a quick fix. Several tenants have been without basic needs for several years because the necessary repairs have not been done. There is never room in the dumpsters for garbage because people come off the street to dump their garbage for free and nothing is ever done about it. Elevators are constantly broken and out of service weekly. Elevators always have dog urine in them and is never cleaned. The ""secure"" door in the lobby is always open for anyone to come in, or broken. One of the tenants that did repairs in the building gossips to the rest of the building what the inside of their apartment is like which is not only disrespectful but a violation of privacy. Overall the health and safety standards of this building are absolutely subpar. If the health unit ever came into this building and did a full inspection I have no doubt this building would be condemned because the management and the landlord refuse to properly take care of the building or do necessary repairs. They just want to make money and put as little into the building as possible. Renting from this building means a run down overpriced apartment with kitchen counters that are painted over, appliances from the 1980's/90's that constantly break, have neighbors who are convicted felons and constantly steal from everyone in the building regardless of the security cameras because nothing is ever done, and having to pay for all your repairs and renovations out of pocket because the landlord will never come do them. I would stay far far away from anything this company owns."
268,NATHAN REID HOLDINGS,CAMBRIDGE,"We enjoy our rental, and our contact with Nathan Reid Holdings (Berjen) is wonderful to deal with. They respond to repair requests relatively quickly, and respect rules regarding notice to enter units. However, the actual owner is cheap and will never do anything beyond the bare minimum in terms of upkeep. Appliances are cheap and replaced with cheaper versions when they break. Flooring is in poor shape and won’t be replaced during rental period. Exterior repairs like missing shingles and siding damaged in storms is almost never done. 

Recently, Nathan himself stopped by under the pretence of a smoke detector inspection. He used the visit to threaten selling the property… unless of course we could agree to raise the rent by several hundred a month. Hard to imagine a holding company with hundreds of units is so hard for cash that they’d need to sell one particular unit unless they could get a few hundred more in rent. Felt more like a phishing expedition with no paper trail. We’ll let the LTB decide.

Overall, expect a decent unit with privacy and very little landlord interaction, but the bare minimum in terms of upkeep and repairs, and an owner willing the skirt the laws to get as much money out of you as possible."
269,JENNIFER HUDSON,OSHAWA,Jennifer is a great landlord. I've actually only met her once when she came in to do a repair but she's nice and the price was reasonable for the whole house
270,ALEX YU,GUELPH,"Most accommodating, understanding and kind landlord. Trusts us completely, only comes when we ask."
271,THE SILVER GROUP,ST. CATHARINES,"Office Lady is rarely around. If you are speaking with her she will cut you off mid-sentence and end the phone call or just walk away. The maintenance is poorly done and by the previous man was downright terrifying.   If you are a tenant that's been there awhile and your not paying the ridiculously high rent they want, your complaints and repair requests will get ignored.  staff feel like its totally ok to put BOTH elevators on service at the same time so no one can get around the building. (they have been told multiple times they are going to get someone killed because of it)  Only time anything gets done is when they are threatened with legal action or going to the city. They have no respect for tenants. when someones passed away they pressure the family to get it cleaned out ASAP.  Multiple criminal issues in the building and nothing gets done. (ex.  units getting broken into, cars getting stolen from the parking lots, a fire in the building that the alarms didn't go off for)  Police are in the building quite regularly.  The lobby gets cleaned regularly but no where else in the building seems to get cleaned. Bodily fluids and other bio hazards have been left in the elevator for 2-3 days before getting cleaned."
272,CAMERON WILLIAMS,ALEXANDRIA,nothing short of harrassing him by phone can get things fixed in a timely manner
273,PINEDALE,EAST YORK,"The Management doesn't want to keep the buildings, environment clean at all.  They just don't want to spend any money.  
Also, when the Elevators go down in any buildings, they will keep them like that for few days (since they have a contract with someone outside the Management, like a third party), and untill that third party contractors are not free to take on the next assignment (as per their priority list), they wouldn't come to our building to fix the Elevators.

Their parking lots are shit, and some shit keep on dropping on the cars, and not matter how many times you go and complain, their side of the story is: 
It is not our responsibility if some damage happens to your cars, while in our parking garage (Please refer to the Rental Agreement).

Also, the Management is very restrictive of moving the Lease to someone else (like Lease Transfer from one person to another).  This is due to the fact that they want to make large some of money, if they were to rent out the apartment to a new party (on their own); and hence wouldn't cooperate with the existing Tenants who living and paying rent on time, for a long time."
274,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Well, writing this review when I am in this building for just one day,
I moved yesterday & ordered a package from Amazon which was supposed to come today, by the end of the day, it didn't come so I checked Amazon app delivery status & it was saying ""delivered today"". & There was a picture from Amazon of product infront of my order. So I checked outside of door but there was a nothing.
Then went to security desk & complaint about it and got to know that it is very very common and usual thing in this building to get package stolen by other residents. & Cherry on the cake is there are no camera on floor so they can't do as well.
All I can do is complaint to management tomorrow but I know nothing will happen. It is like this & it will be like this."
275,ISAAC SELBY,LINDSAY,"The nicest of the student houses I stayed in, in my opinion. It is a lovely victorian home with a good kitchen. However, Isaac Selby is very uncommunicative. For the beginning of my stay he was on a trip out of town and left his father as a contact, which worked just fine, but upon returning to Lindsay he remained near impossible to contact. I'm not sure if he doesn't ever check his emails or texts, or if he simply ignores those from tenants, but expect it to take weeks to ever get into contact with him after you've moved in. For the most part, this was okay as my roommates and I got along well and no major issues arise. However it was very troubling struggling to get through to him to get my deposit back after moving out."
276,HRS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,They buy places with decent rent and then jack up the prices because they know students need somewhere to live. The apartment had roaches and silverfish and unsafe fire detectors.
277,MONTCREST APARTMENTS,TORONTO,Where do I begin. They do yearly AGIs. Many of which is done with cheap labour that results in the areas leaking and needing another AGI. The supers aren’t friendly and are aggressive. The head office accountant is incredibly rude/ aggressive. There has been so many breakins to the parking garage and the cars with barely anything done/ the building doesn’t care at all and the also includes the Property Management team and the owners. People have to beg and fight for appliances  to be fixed. So many peoples fridges have stopped working resulting in food loss and the building hasn’t covered it. People were given notices for being on the public space/grace. The side doors are often broken which is a safety issue.
278,DEE-ANNE HAMER,HAMILTON,"The owner is a horrible woman, she finally hired a property manager who made life bareable.  Dee-anne refuses to comply with basic health and safety -shoveling the snow and salting."
279,TL BOTHWELL,GUELPH,"Pretty garbage property managers. The first time they introduced themselves, they left sheets in our screen door (not individual mailboxes) and asked for our rents to be sent by etransfer that same day, even though we didn't know they were even the new property managers! They then immediately threatened to evict anyone who didn't pay. Since then, they've tried to scramble parking arrangements (not allowed through our leases), entered into units without 24 hours notice, given keys to contract workers to enter units without tenants being there, and prolonged maintenance for months at a time. They constantly talk down to tenants and don't bother to build any sort of good rapport. If you do have a problem, they ask to give your number to the worker so you can schedule everything yourself. They don't manage the property well and expect you to be happy when they do aesthetic fixes rather than deal with the actual problem. Then they get fussy when you complain that the ""hidden"" issue has come back up. If you have to have a property with them, expect to manage everything yourself."
280,LIBBY PLAYFORD/,ELMIRA,"We found this landlord to be rude and accusatory. We had damage in our unit the day we moved in and when reported we were told we would need to pay to fix it if we wanted it done. We were blamed for mold when nearly every unit has it and even with two dehumidifiers running 24/7 water still collects in the corners of the rooms. Many of the tenants have gone with broken balcony doors, closet doors, leaking toilets, lights not working, etc with either no fix or it gets pushed off as long as possible. The supers are also extremely rude, they watch the tenants to report back to the landlord and threatened a friend who was waiting outside the building to pick me up. The washer and dryer are dirty and cost you $6 to do a load, if the dryer is even working."
281,ALDEBRAIN,SCARBOROUGH,"Very knowledgeable and respectful of people's needs who have physical disabilities, including brain injury. The fairest landlord I ever had. Incorporates improvements gradually. Not greedy. Wheelchair accessible units are well-equipped and spacious. Provide rent-geared to income units in accordance with City of Toronto's rules."
282,RAVI BEDI,KITCHENER,"Was a fantastic landlord, and was extremely hands-off on the property - until he could make extra money out of you. lied about renewing a lease when an unruly roommate left, and rewrote the contract to charge considerably more money for the rest of us that remained for no reason in a ""Take it or leave it"" situation, after promising not to. Additionally, refused to return the security deposits after we payed for a professional cleaner to come in and deep clean the property, claiming it was ""absolutely filthy"". It looked like a new build by the time we left. I tried arguing his decision with an album of before and after pictures that I took on move-in day, and after moving out, as people suggest doing. Turns out, if the landlord just refuses to cooperate, those pictures are meaningless.

Outside of that, the property we rented was in excellent condition, no major issues in the time we lived there. I'd rent from them again, if I had the money to throw away on the security deposit, and just wouldn't take their word for anything until I got it in writing."
283,LILIANA DIAZ AND DAVID FARRANT,TORONTO,"They changed the rental price on us 3 times in 3 months. They kept trying to gaslight us and said they didn't change anything, but we couldn't afford to live there in the first place, we were very aware of the price changes.
When we confronted them on this in an email (in a respectful manner, asking them to please be aware of our financial situation- but we will pay the increased price) they told us to gtfo. 

The basement gets incredibly smoky whenever you use the stove or oven; you absolutely need to turn on the fan every time you cook."
284,HENRY TINGHO,MISSISSAUGA,"My landlord is terrible.  When the microwave that is also the exhaust fan broke he offered to remove it and take 100.00 of the rent and not replace it.  I declined the offer, he replaced it with a used one. My washer has leaked for a year, and they just won't fix it. And my kitchen sink has not drained properly for 4 months.  Now that I'm moving out they want to repair it, but they want to charge me the 1st 100.00 for the repair.  My landlord is represented by a realtor, who is horrible as well, so I'm not sure who is not getting the repairs completed?  When my wardrobe bar broke, I have to fix it.  The condo unit itself is a nice unit, but it has 3 elevators for the 28 buidling unit and one is always broken.  It has not been a great experience."
285,JEN T,TORONTO,"The landlord herself was nice just various things would be in need of repair for long periods of time. The place itself was decent for what it was, it was just too hard living there because it was too noisy and I could never found a moment of peace."
286,WALTER TACCONELLI,NEPEAN,"I've been renting from Walter and Monique for around five years. I think they're very good people. Landlording is a business, but I've always felt like they care more than that. I take care a lot of my own issues independently because I'm like that. But they've always acted very quickly when I've called them because of a required repair that was beyond what I could or wanted to do. After my experience with my previous landlord/property management company, I'm very grateful to have landlords like Walter and Monique. Even when I've been annoyingly slow to respond to stuff they need, they've been patient and good to me. I recommend them."
287,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"If you like ants, cockroaches and mice, constant construction and $2,000+ for a closet with no amenities this is the place for you. Had to get so much work done over and over and over because they’ll never actually address the main issue. Mould in the bathroom ceiling 4 times? Keep scraping and repainting instead of updating the vents.  Just run!!"
288,DANIA,ORANGEVILLE,"The garage door was never repaired from the previous tenants, my toilet exploded & flooded all 3 floors which they never repaired, they never fixed the dishwasher, the microwave, the dryer, the step out front was wobbly which caused my sister to fracture her ankle (they had put a small piece of wood under it), they never replaced any screens from the previous tenants, never fixed the back door. They are the meaning of slumlords. Yet they expected $3,000 per month plus all utilities for just the top part of the house. Oh, & the lady in the basement always screaming at her son, which you could hear through the door. I stopped paying by the end. Also didn't have heat for about 5 weeks before I moved out in December."
289,DAPHNE DEAN,KINGSTON,"Complete disregard for tenant privacy. Speaks disrespectfully to tenants. Threatens tenants with legal fees. Constant fear-mongering. Illegal terms in lease (no pets, no visitors after certain times, utilities deposit required upon signing). The only reason she's still in business is because she owns half of the student housing in Kingston and she charges a competitive rate for rent."
290,TRICON RESIDENCE,TORONTO,"They have bed bugs in the units, and refuse to do anything about it. I have a suspicion that my super entered my unit multiple times without my permission after I filed a claim with the LLTB. My underwear also used to go missing from laundry machines all the time! GROSS building!"
291,PARK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"I've lived in a building managed by Park Property Management for two years now and it's fantastic. Best property managers I've ever encountered. Repairs are attending to promptly, often within an hour of submitting a request. The building is well maintained and there are regular, scheduled maintenance activities, like replacing the filters in the HVAC system and checking the smoke detectors. Whenever something is happening that might disrupt tenants' lives, notice is given both in posted signs and through BuildingStack (which sends emails to tenants). These notices always go up at least a day in advance, and usually several days in advance. I've never had anyone enter the unit without sufficient notice or valid reason. Requests that other landlords/property managers would treat as unreasonable (e.g., for bird netting to be put up on a balcony) are handled by the building with zero fuss."
292,PHIL CANNON,OSHAWA,"He bought the place and paid tenants off to move because their rent was not enough. He took a family to court (who never defaulted on rent payments) to court because they wouldn’t accept his payout (they have***** $10k - that’s***** nowadays). In court they mediated instead. He said he has a disabled child and needs the place to live but it’s only him and his wife and he has a beautiful home and cottage. He just wanted more money. Tenants decided to agree to get out because they can’t take him anymore. Their place has never been fixed or upgraded since this landlord bought the place because he just wants them out. The toilet leaks, the wiring in basement is destroyed, there are too many things wrong inside to list. 
The driveway is a small parking lot that fits***** (2 per unit in a 4plex) he doesn’t plow it in winter."
293,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"Akelius was offering a free month of rent with a***** I had to reach out to the LTB to ask if that was legal, and after learning I’m entitled to that free month of rent, I brought up to my landlord. They’ve also entered my apartment with no notice or permission. AND, No superintendent on site!!!!! They wanted to charge me $***** for a locksmith to get into my unit after forgetting my keys at my parents house. Horrible… also not a Canadian company, so just weird how they do business."
294,SAMAR SALMAN,TORONTO,"Stay away from any buildings owned by this landlord. I lived there for a year and it was one of the worst years of my life. The floor was crumbling and gave us splinters, there was mold in the bathroom water damage everywhere and many things were in poor repair, but requests for repairs often went months (and repeated follow-ups) without being actioned. The landlords and/or repair people were constantly entering our unit to access the boiler without giving us sufficient notice (often there was no notice whatsoever). There were centipedes in the bathroom/kitchen and mice in the walls, and one bedroom shared a wall with a den that raccoons were living in. At one point, they decided to repair the plumbing beneath our bathroom, and we abruptly lost access to our home for an entire week. The landlords were deeply disrespectful to any tenant concerns, constantly assuring us that they ""cared about us"" but retaliating when concerns were raised."
295,COX INVESTMENTS,ST CATHARINES,"Moved in December of this year, furnace wasn't working properly took***** The property managers response was ill bring space heaters instead of just having someone look at the furnace . Garbage outside the unit was unbearable from loose garbage, paint cans, crack pipes, pill bottles and more landlord wouldn't deal with the  issue so we had to call bylaw. Unit*****"
296,LYNN GOLDMAN (45 KINGSBURY SQUARE),GUELPH,"Absolutely terrible woman to deal with. She said she cleaned the property before I moved in, but there was urine and hair all over the bathroom, the carpets were filthy and it smelled like well, urine. 

 I paid through February when I was renting for her, and she entered the property without my knowledge and sent all of my remaining items to the thrift store. She ended up paying me some cash for it but only after I threatened to get the police involved."
297,MORGAN STE. MARIE / MORDINI RESIDENTIAL,OSHAWA,"Morgan never gives rent receipts, been waiting over***** (still not done) his contractors steal items. He threatens with eviction when you challenge him on the tenant rules. I will say that he does a lot of outdoor maintenance and building upgrades just not tenant repairs unless it turns into worse case then he sometimes fixes it. When challenged with the enforcement and he loses he just does what he chooses after. Even took away the residents control over the heat in which most of us had full control for over a decade. I will give him 2.5 stars as I do like the work done on the outside of the building (even thought it's a tax write off and a way for him to increase the rent)"
298,KAMAL MAHMOUD,DRIFRWOOD,"He sold us on a farm property, for goats/a business growing and selling food, that was safe and secure with fresh water and local places to sell goods... what we arrived to was a damaged fence (along a busy highway) that is going to be fully removed for road construction, a massive amount of local waste that had been dumped on the road side along with the original owners dump pile of glass and metal. polluted water and river (dead beavers among other fun finds..), it's not even safe for fishing in, trespassing, people/truckers honking when they drive by because the locals don't like that the land was bought by someone outside of Canada, he didnt know his own property boundaries and was renting us land he didn't even own, he has no plans for a well or power hookup (which can run $20k+) even though the highway closes regularly in the winter and there's no access to water or food. The closest town is***** The neighbors do not like strangers and although they will give you water if you need it, they do not want you to be their friend. Their dog tries to lure your animals off the property (she does this to no fault of her own, just as a heads up if your animals don't have good recall!). The mosquitoes are so bad during the summer you can't sleep at night unless you are in something *****% bug proof (tape your vents). The black flies, deer flies and horseflies are so bad you can't be outside in the spring/summer/fall without full gear on (good luck keeping the blackflies out though, they're tiny and get through the specialized nettings as well). The local foxes are extremely aggressive, do not approach. The winters get down to -50°c and the summers can get up to 50°c. Be prepared for both. The heat might kill you faster than the cold if you don't have water on hand (snow can be melted and purified in winter in case of emergency). There gets up to 6' of snow in winter. There's no driveway. It's a mud pit."
299,PRAKASH PATEL,SCARBOROUGH,"I am currently staying in that house. But the problem is the house is too old, and also all the things inside are not a good quality for use. One good thing about the Landlord is that if any tenant faces any issues of any other tenant he takes strict action and participates equally in helping others. The basement is too congested to use especially since*****"
300,STEVE FALLA,AURORA,"Steve is a drunk and not a great landlord, house sits on an ant hill and they have traveled to the 2nd floor of the house. It is a serious issue he won't address."
301,CYNTHIA & TREVOR JERRICK,OSHAWA,"By far the worst renting experience ever! Cynthia and her husband (mainly Cynthia) first introduced themselves as “chill, nice people” and they couldn’t have been *****% the opposite. From going through personal belongings while I wasn’t home to swearing/talking down to me, trying to control hours I could come and leave, who I could have over etc… they were both very immature to put it lightly. They felt like they were king and queen and could do whatever they wanted because they were the home owners and I was only a tenant. My advice is stay as far away from these horrible people as you can!"
302,CYNTHIA EDWARDS,OSHAWA,"By far the worst renting experience ever! Cynthia and her husband (mainly Cynthia) first introduced themselves as “chill, nice people” and they couldn’t have been *****% the opposite.

They felt like they were king and queen and could do whatever they wanted because they were the home owners and I was only a tenant. My advice is stay as far away from these horrible people as you can!"
303,GREG CHITILIAN,MARKHAM,"Our landlord has absolutely zero respect for his tenants. We rent a house in Markham and there was another lady renting a room in a separate part of the house who ended up getting very ill. We asked the landlord to check on her numerous times which he refused to do because she was paying her rent on time. Sadly, the woman fell in her room and passed away in hospital a couple days later. He refuses to do anything or make any repairs. He has given his contractor the key to the back door so he can use the bathroom when he is doing work outside which is very wrong and is an invasion of our privacy. He shows up constantly unannounced and without any notice. And he speaks down to us very rudely. He is definitely one the worst landlords I have ever had."
304,CAROL GLYN-WILLIAMS,GUELPH,Overall a good landlady - quick to respond to phone/texts and will repair appliances promptly. Friendly and polite. House is old but well-maintained. Landlady's husband comes to mow the grass every other day in the summer and will sometimes show up at the door  or enter the property through the laundry room with minimal notice. Can be somewhat patronising - refused to reinstall pantry doors as the previous tenants were careless with them. Rent was $***** in***** It was raised to ~$***** including utilities in ***** (adding this in so there is a frame of reference). No pets allowed even though this is against the Residential Tenancies Act.

307,TCHC,TORONTO,"TCHC IS THE MOST CORRUPT LANDLORD AND THEY USE THE MONEY ON THEMSELVES TO LIVE LUXURY LIVES. THE STAFF AT THIS BUILDING TAKES ITEMS SUCH AS CLEANING SUPPLIES, LIGHT BULBS, PAINTS AND TILES TO THEIR OWN HOMES. THEIVES!!"
308,THE CONSERVATORY  GROUP,TORONTO,I've had my superintendent say he wants to kill himself what kind of tallk is  that.I totally get that he is under a lot of pressure to look after the building .not very professional.
309,CAPREIT MIMICO ESTATES,TORONTO,"Bedbugs, roaches, ants, rats, mold, cheap renovations, management turnover, incompetent management, theft, No security, frequent water emergencies and water turnoffs, outsourcing maintenance and services so upkeep of clean facilities is minimal, won’t allow long term residents any considerations for changing or upgrading apartments but insist on treating them like new tenants expected to pay hyper-inflated market rate rents for substandard apartments with no amenities."
310,YASHAR MOUSTAFA,TORONTO,"My landlord, Yashar Moustafa, on Feb 17, *****, in a confronting manner upon seeing me in the lobby, verbally asked to increase rent by***** CAD after April 30th, *****- I provisionally accepted this verbally not knowing that the this increase was above yearly guidelines. Moreover, he  asked me to sign a new yearly lease (against the Ontario RTA);I refused to do so. Also, he requested that I directly deposit a cheque into his account for for monthly rent payments after April***** Next, on Sunday Feb 19, *****, he sent an email asking me to vacate the apartment by April 30,***** On Tuesday, Feb 21,***** In the meantime, I hired a paralegal. To add, I recently repaired a leaking toilet at my own expense after I previously mentioned this issue to him, and he did nothing at the time. My paralegal had asked him to reimburse me for this expense; he only paid back the plumbing fee via cheque, but not the cost of the part to be replaced which I purchased; this was ignored by him although we mentioned potential LTB action. Also, my landlord asked to increase the rent using the correct form to***** (he put May instead of June *****)- he later sent an email indicating June-not using the proper form again to highlight this increase. Moreover, the fridge needs to be repaired, and I had previously indicated this to him and he did nothing,  after the paralegal mentioned it, he provides me with the number of the company to call  to repair the fridge at my convenience (written note  through the concierge and via email), providing no indication whether he will be paying for fees for repair! He also invaded my privacy by asking my  whereabouts to various concierges, and whether I was a ""good"" tenant, and requesting to speak with me at the lobby via messages to the concierges!!"
311,2634692 ONTARIO LIMITED,TORONTO,"When the landlord bought the property from someone else, he miscalculated the balance and charged harassing the tenants. The tenants had to pay more to avoid conflict. All tenants complain that landlord."
312,CONDOLYN MANAGEMENT,AJAX,Lynne Papizzo will stop at nothing to evict tenants illegally. I was in a home for***** She told my landlord that they could get more money by saying their child was going to take over the house. A month after I left the place went up for higher rent. She never fixes anything and if she does she sends cheap handymen who can’t fix nothing. She will be nice as pie to rent to you and one month after she is a living **** to deal with. She also won’t give me my last months interest that I never received for*****
313,SVETLANA (EFFORT RENTALS),DUNDAS,"Landlord do constant maintenance of the building by weekly vacuuming, and updating parking lots, parking lines, water maintenance and electric maintenance and fire alarm tests every months, etc. 

Very happy with this management. Hopefully they keep it up for a long time"
314,GOLDMAR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"Horrible company. Will harass you & let you live in mold while not repairing anything. Will allow flooding & be like we will get around to it. No privacy at all,***** Would not recommend."
315,CAPREIT,SCARBOROUGH,Pretty bad to follow security protocols for parking security and pest/mold control. The repairs take too long to complete and sometimes you have to ask repeatedly for repairs.
316,GWLRA,TORONTO,"GWLRA will raise your rent above guidelines every year with “justified” reasoning like desperately needed window replacements that “happened***** ago” without ever doing them. They neglect their existing buildings for the brand new ones across the street. They brag about having a***** & nothing gets done to fix your issues. They’ve taken away our indoor pool & gym without warning or replacement. One of the managers, Dominic, is the biggest piece of work out there & will either ignore you or belittle you when you raise issues. The closeness to High Park and the subway is really the only benefit of these buildings. They were managed far better when Minto owned us. Dominic & GWLRA do not care & actively make living here harder."
317,TONY DESOUSA,WHITBY,"At every stage, just quite simply a caring person who clearly wants to do right by his people, and that seems to include tenants.

Patient, seemed quite happy to give second chances, competent and timely. Was kind in helping us pass the lease to a roommate who was not on it, even going under market.

I generally have a dim view on landlords, but 11/10. I would absolutely rent from him again. Only reason I left was to move in with friends."
318,COMER GROUP (2230 LAWRENCE EAST),SCARBOROUGH,"They're pretty ok and relatively sane rental price with hydro included, as long as you don't ask for repairs. It takes them forever to do any repairs. Also, neighbours with mold and rat problems. Prepare rat traps and anti fungal spray when you move in. Expect some repair to still be required when you move in and months to settle any pending repairs. Few families moved in recently with some minor issues here and there. You get what you pay for I guess."
319,ANDREW AZINOV,WINDSOR,"Single room rental for student housing. Wow. Where do I even start. Inappropriate relations with tenants, neglectful upkeep, extremely unsafe, police visits at the house weekly, several physically violent domestic disturbances with landlord and other tenants. Terrible vetting process for house mates. Landlord made me extremely uncomfortable and feel unsafe."
320,FOREST HILL KIPLING,MISSISSAUGA,"Company took over our building, left a letter in the mailbox about a week before the change. They sent us an eviction notice based on payments sent to the old landlord during the transition period, even after we tried to get them to work with us on this. Any money sent to the old landlord has not been returned after months of follow ups. They seem to have an agenda to get the old tenants out so the rent can be increased to market rates. They sent us a second rent increase after we already received one in the past***** (illegal). They send monthly notices to tenants to get tenant insurance (messaging is borderline harassment in my view), even if not required by your lease. They implemented very expensive parking for visitors.  Maintenance system with the app seems to work well."
321,DAVE GIROUX,GRAND BEND,"Rented single room, landlord frequently opened my room door when I wasn't home, despite being asked not to. Controlling: refused to run air conditioner in summer, and refused to open windows, resulting in very uncomfortable living quarters. Confrontational communication (I.e.-when addressing parking space in the driveway, said ""don't park there or I could back into and smash your car up like I did my last tenants"" or ""don't open the windows, my cat will scratch out the screen and run into the road and get hit by a car and die""). Many cats, peeing all over the house. A surprising amount of mice for the number of cats, I had to throw out most of my food and pantry items. 2/10, do not recommend cat **** Dave's rental, unless you can tolerate any of the above."
322,EQUITON LIVING,LONDON,"The building manager is incredibly rude and behaves like police as opposed to a building manager who is there to address tenant concerns. Their available hours are ridiculous (8am-4pm) and unless it’s an emergency, we aren’t to contact them after hours, but yet they demand parking passes for guests but don’t give them out past 4pm. She passed out a letter a few months ago that was just ludicrous outlining her “rules” for the building. 

The building itself is aged and maintenance has not been maintained causing them to shut off our water nearly weekly for repairs. They are “upgrading” suites to jack up the rent, but it’s still a derelict building with HVAC, water, and pharaoh ants…just now with $*****+ rent."
323,MANUFORTI MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"I lived in my apartment for***** Here are all the ways I was poorly treated:
-was asked to write affidavits to landlord tenant board about other tenants that management disliked 
-all tenants received harassing, unprofessional and aggressive letters under our doors to address management's concerns, very unprofessional
-management lost my rent cheques on more than one occasion resulting in me incurring extra fees to place stop payments and reissue cheques
-was told several considerable repairs would be done, were never done
-went months without a fridge waiting for a repair 
-when reporting a maintenance concern was told ""they have bigger concerns, like rats in the basement""
-was blamed for water damage from a leak in the unit above me, they tried to invoice me thousands for repairs, when they waited months to repair
-they gaslit and bullied me about how I left their unit in such a ""disgusting filthy state"", referring to the water and mold damage from the leak above that I had reported for months without them taking any action
-on my last month, they messaged me to say they accidentally forgot to take me off the auto-pay the day before rent was due, they asked me to let them withdrawal funds from my account and they would write me a cheque instead. I had already paid last months rent years prior when I signed the lease so declined and had to pay for a stop payment on their account
-I filed a complaint through the LTB and City inspector 
-unpeofessional behaviour toward other tenants behind their backs, gossiping, bullying, manipulation"
324,"PRINCESS MANAGEMENT , 10 TEESDALE PLACE .",SCARBOROUGH,They behave like they are our boss and we are the employee of them. There is nothing to stop them . It is very much disappointed  a country like Canada.
325,HRS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,Don't ever go for it. Key deposit and cleaning fee is not returned  to so many tenants. Bugs in house.

Also they haven’t returned an overpayment of rent we sent them, and they refuse to  return it back to us, House has black mold issues due to flooding remedied with bandaid fixes because they “couldn’t afford” what contractors told them needed to be done, wouldn’t give the water bill to us for over a year despite multiple reminders on our end, then sent us a fat $***** bill and blamed it on us somehow, avoid these landlords like the plague, they’ll smile right in your face while they stab you in the back. (If anyone ends up renting from them, challenge whatever inevitable notice they give you, take them straight to an LTB hearing as they have a history of bad faith)"

332,BRADWICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH BAY,"Bradwick is a property management group that does business for many owners in North Bay. 

They will do anything to get tax breaks for the property owners, regardless of how detrimental it is to the renter; they redid the insulation and installed new windows all for the tax break a few years ago, but there unit is draftier than it was before, and the windows are the lowest quality you could get both in terms of soundproofing and airtightness. 

They also will take years to finish the a job if it is deemed a lower priority; window installation damaged some walls, and they took***** (even the guys who were doing the job were surprised that the work order was so old).

They also have an antiquated payment system: office hours are Mon-Fri, 8:30am-5pm. It became a hassle to get there to drop off the post-dated cheques, as I would have to take the day off. I had tried mailing them in the past, but they were lost twice. I, and others in my complex, have asked them to use eTransfer multiple times, but they refuse to do so. If you want, you can also use your debit card in the office during their hours. Oh and please be timely with them, as they will lock the office doors as 4:55pm if they don't see anyone parked in front (has happened several times).

All in all, you can get much worse, but there is a lot of room for improvement."
333,ALEX AND JOLIE TRINH,HANOVER,"Awful new landlords, they wanted everyone in the building to get new rental contracts when we each already had our own contacts. This is illegal btw, no one is required to sign anything new if they already have a rental agreement with the previous landlords. They don't have a property manager and hire tenants (for a slightly reduced rent rate) to maintain the property including snow removal, sweeping/upkeep of the building. Randomly had the heating go out and didn't fix it for over a week and everyone was stuck in the cold. They also wouldn't deal with garbage and recycling bins, we had to do everything ourselves. Not a good experience overall."

339,SID MANAGEMENT,TIMMINS,"I rented from this company when it was RWC management-when I first rented from them they didn’t have stuff locally so it was a bit difficult to get things repaired in a timely fashion. However, they hired a local property manager who has been nothing but great any time we’ve needed anything. 
Any time we have called her with a maintenance issue it has been repaired within a couple of days when we fell on some financial troubles, and called her in regards to our rent being late she was totally understanding and let us know the process to create a plan to catch up She’s always been very quick to respond to us  
When we needed to move to a bigger home, she found one in her inventory. That was the perfect fit for us and helped us complete all of the paperwork to get a transfer approved by the head office. We’ve never had such a great landlord."

347,PALNOS INVESTMENTS,TORONTO,"Nightmare slum lords. 
The apartment building is dilapidated to say the least. The elevator has never been serviced. It fell two floors with me in it. It’s broken every few days, and the landlords don’t bat an eye.
Over half of the laundry machines have been broken for years. They recently changed the laundry hours to 7am-6pm, an unreasonable cut off time, and threatened to throw out any clothing left in the room after 6pm. The plumbing backs up every year, including Christmas, when we were stranded for five days with no running water. Basically any amenity is forgotten. 
I don’t think the building has ever had certified maintenance. Most of the walls are falling apart. There’s no way this place is to code. The landlords own several other neglected buildings in Parkdale. Steer clear if you can."

Both By Law and ESA indicated I must move immediately, appliances that were overloading circuits must be removed, and construction was required on the windows to meet code. She refused to return the rent I had just paid and my last month's rent. I was not aware of my rights through LTB. This was my son and my first apartment leaving our house and an abusive situation.

Save yourselves the massive headaches. These are terrible, rude, extremely nosy people who absolutely love to take advantage at any point they can and believe they have all the rights and make it seem like the tennants have no rights. To hune your only right is to pay rent or leave like it or not"
356,VICKY ZICKOS,SCARBOROUGH,"I believe Vicky tries to be a reasonable landlord, but she falls of the mark quite considerably. The house by Midland/Danforth in Scarborough is a disaster to live in. Mold grows in the bathrooms. Black goop comes out of the basements drains. She threatens to evict its tenants every few months for not cleaning the unit properly, which does hold some merit, however, her approach is completely wrong and off-putting.

At first, Vicky might seem like a great landlord and person, but her lack of ability to properly manage the house causes the***** I issued numerous complaints during my residency and nothing ever got done properly. Without going into great detail or story behind the situation, I would not live underneath this landlord again. Also the unit I was living in was considered illegal at the time as room and board was against the rules back then. It might be different now but she is just out to make a quick buck without monitoring the property. My review seems all over the place but this is just my own experience with her. Avoid renting from Vicky Zickos if you can."
357,SUSAN LI,HUNTSVILLE,"Landlord constantly hassling us tenants, Has been trying to evict us to double the rent , after being here***** has taken back our use of garage space and Porch use.

Keeps stating the property is hers to do as she wishes."
358,SATELLITE COMMUNITY HOMES PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS CAMBRIDGE KIWANIS VILLAGE HOUSING,CAMBRIDGE,Staff are friendly and easy to get a hold of. They have always fixed emergency issues instantly even after hours. The company Cambridge Kiwanis Village Housing recently amalgamated with Satellite Community Homes to be able to offer more affordable homes/transfers which is great. They do regular inspections and are preventative on pest control. They are trying their best to clean up the properties as tenants can't seem to learn how to recycle and throw away trash properly. Overall they are an amazing company and not the problem.
359,TRILOGY CONDOS,TORONTO,"They increased my rent by 15% in one year at***** What will it be next year or the year after? We need real rent control!! Not just for older buildings. The rest of the building is pretty nice tho, but they seem to use the budget for fresh flowers, decor, parties.. when they could just keep the rent more reasonable. It's really my only complaint, the rest is nice."
360,FRANCESS FELIX,TORONTO,"The landlady coerced, harassed and intimidated tenants. She came over to the house numerous times without notice, moved tenants possessions outside, physically assaulted tenants, sexually harassed tenants, called the police stating tenants are assaulting her, and even sent people over to the house to threaten the tenant's lives if they report the problems or go to the police. The house had water damage/mold remediation work done at least***** The ceiling collapsed numerous times. Contractors who did come over did not consider tenant's health and safety; they yanked fire alarms / smoke detectors / carbon monoxide alarms out from the ceiling while they were going off instead of trying to find a solution to the problems they caused. The walls are insulated with styrofoam and/or garbage. The contractors have admitted to  the house having mold in it, yet the landlady denies this. There are animals, insects and rodents living in the walls. Again, nothing has been done to solve these problems. She has claimed to be a social worker who works in housing, which is not true. She has lied to lawyers, police, tenants, family members, neighbours, LTB adjudicators in order to get her way. She has come over to the house without notice, taken her clothes off, screaming that she lives here and yelled at her daughter to call the police stating that the tenants were trespassing and assaulting them. When police showed up, they had to escort them off the property. All of this was captured on video.

Most, if not all, of what is written in this review has photo/audio/video/written proof backing it up. She is a predatory slumlord who cannot be trusted. I am afraid for my life and I hope that nobody ever had to deal with what we have had to deal. She cannot be trusted."
361,RHAPSODY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Been living in one of their buildings for***** worry-free years of my life when it comes to property management.

362,PINEDALE PROPERTY LTD,TORONTO,So unprofessional and disrespectful towards people who don’t speak English well
363,DIPIN DHINGRA,BRAMPTON,"One of the best landlords I have come across. He is more like a friend, than a landlord. Always respectful and asks for permission if he needs to enter for any reason. He waived off my partial rent a few times without asking. I pray everyone has such a landlord"
364,VIDA OBLEFIAS BACCHUS,SCARBOROUGH,"***** girl's only place. At the time of viewing  they did not disclose that there were cameras, that they would make unannounced visits - without knocking as well - and that they claimed one of the bedrooms as their room for lease purposes (tenants have less rights when living with the landlord). Her husband would also pop by unannounced and with out declaring himself before entering. 

He would surveille us with the cameras commenting on how we arranged our shoes in the entrance or watching who came in. There were strictly no boys despite all roomates agreeing for us to have a male guest over and would watch the cameras to ensure this. 

Landlord's husband was also not open to questions about rules and would be rude and abusive and resort to name calling and swearing."
365,CLOPARK MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Leaves the tenants to fend for themselves when problems arise in the building such as when the water heater goes out or the internet stops working in multiple the apartments. Almost never responds to any requests for repairs or help, and when they do, they give false promises to follow up but never do. Really sad attempts to appear as if they care but they clearly don't care at all; it's all a facade, a veneer. Shalini is deceptive and hides her true nature. Very sad state of affairs. Looking forward to leaving soon"
366,CITY BLOX PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MIDLAND,"City Blox Property Management is a nightmare to deal with. They think they can create whatever rules they want instead of following the ones they’re obligated to by law. Most maintenance requests are met with severe stalling and delay (sometimes several years) and they’ll try to find a way to blame you for everything to deflect accountability. If you do not know/ defend your tenant rights, they will exploit you."
367,GOWAN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH YORK,"Absolutely  horrible. 
No one knows how to contact "" property management"" if need be. 
Moody ceiling tiles in the hallways and holes in the ceiling tiles.
Drug dealers are rampid and ""management "" does nothing.  Snow  removal  is atrocious.  Drug dealers making deals in the parking lot daily.   Dangerous  walking at night in the parking lot. Area is horrible and the building fits right in to the Drug infested  area."
368,CRECCAL INVESTMENTS,TORONTO,"Huge issue with roaches, dirty and unkept entry ways (dog pee and poo), garage, and floors; noisy neighbours, elevators are unsafe, elevator sensors do not work hitting people all the time, management not so polite or empathic, sometimes inconsiderate and harassing residents, lot of smoking in stairwells and entrances affecting many tenants, repairs need to improve, laundry has issues regularly."
369,TRIVEIRA,ST.CATHARINES,"Awesome landlord, building is so clean, rent is reasonable, very quiet, excellent other tenants."
370,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS LTD.,BURLINGTON,"Be ready for them to be in your house a lot. If you complain, they will find reasons to make trouble for you. 
Avoid at all costs!"
371,NORQUAY,LONDON,"I'm not a fan of landlords at all - but I have to admit that Norquay is a pretty decent property management company. I've lived here for 5.5 years, and in my experience, they don't bother tenants, provide plenty of notice for entry into units and work that will be done on the shared parking lot, abide by the Landlord and Tenant Act of Ontario, perform all health and safety checks on schedule, and respond pretty promptly to any requests for maintenance or other work.  My biggest complaint is that they eliminated the on-site manager position a couple of years ago, so now all work requests have to be called in. This is definitely less convenient. Also, their upkeep of shared outdoor spaces in the townhouse complex is a bit lacking - basically, they just mow the lawn and don't bother with anything else as far as planting gardens, reseeding bare spots, etc. But, they don't bother tenants who put in the effort to spruce up their front or back yards, or pester them to remove items from their patios. Overall - there are definitely much worse landlords to rent from in town, and properties that are much more poorly maintained, so I'd recommend Norquay to anyone who was looking for a place to rent in London."
372,JAN MAZURAK & MARK MAZURAK ( MYJ INVESTMENTS INC.),TORONTO,"This landlord  will go to any extent to get rid of his Tenants especially if they feel they can re-rent for more money. ( Harass, Harass, Harass.) They have no idea what it takes to be a good Landlord."

When large repairs were needed, Jeremy would make sure his contractors took care of them in a timely fashion.

Through my entire time living under Jeremy as my landlord, my rent went from $***** to $***** in*****

My only complaints were the unit I lived in would regularly have issues with humidity and the hardwood floors had started to erupt by the time I was moving out.

Overall, in my experience, Jeremy was an excellent landlord."
377,CLV GROUP,OTTAWA,"Repairs can sometimes take days, or even months. Expect mold, bugs, and mice to be met with apathy most of the time. Several buildings on the property have exterior doors that don't lock properly, or even close, especially in the winter. This allows all kinds of pests to get into the building, so forget controlling them. The wiring in ancient aluminum and the heating is generally pretty inadequate baseboard boiler heating. The landlord also closed all in person offices, so if you need a laundry card, or something done promptly, you're going to have to find the email address or file a ticket. Never mind if it's an emergency like your heating went out in the dead of night midwinter, you need to make a ticket, don't actually call the emergency number."
378,DMS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT LIMITED,TORONTO,"Overall staff possess few skills required to manage a building such as this. It is a seniors rental, and as such DMS treats it as simply a rental building, forgetting that seniors have as many special needs as handicapped people. Paving tiles outside the building are uneven and are begging for a senior to do a face plant. Seniors don't bounce back from broken hips or shoulders like they did when they were younger. The roof had a similar problem until tenants complained for two years. Doors are just now getting wave openings, again only after three years of requesting these to be installed. Building repairs are done poorly by the superintendant, who fiddles around with items for repairs, generally makes them worse and then calls in trades help. Loves to close maintenance work orders even if the work is not complete. Admin consistently fails to keep tenants private issues private. The Manager loses her temper with tenants and acts in a childish way as a retaliation."
379,PMB BARRIE,BARRIE,"This place is absolutely terrible and I am shocked that people would want to rent from such a dispicable company, The owner (Richard) is a belligerent scumbag and I have witnessed his helpers smoking crack and drinking on the job. DO NOT RENT FROM PMB."
380,BOBBY SAFI,OTTAWA,"Constantly argued with my roommate and I about an issue the last tenant caused. Wouldn't bring in a plumber to fix the issue, and when he finally did he was reamed out by the plumber for failing to provide proper plumbing services to our unit and covering up important connections. Unit was absolutely not to code, and we were renovicted when our lease came up. Do not rent!!"
381,WINNIE CHANG,TORONTO,No issues with the landlord. They were okay to deal with.
382,MINTO APARTMENTS,OAKVILLE,"Resident Services does not answer to e-mails nor phone calls. There is just no one you can reach or talk to after hours that is present at the building, making us residents feel unsafe in case of an emergency situation. And even during office hours, the property manager is basically unreachable. They just do not seem to care much about those needs- Much neglect and indifference to tenant claims. Also, overall cleanliness and furniture on social lounges are dirty, zero inviting. Gym seems nice, although I do not make use of it."
383,GWL REALTY - LIVMORE,TOROTNO,"Terrible landlord, leasing agent dishonest.  Homeless in the parkade begging for money.  Packages stolen the hallways.  Pool out of service for months, elevators out of service for months.  Building is less than***** isn't maintaining it or keeping tenants safe.  Moving out ahead of lease to get to somewhere safer and get value for money.  The onsite agent will promise the world and deliver none of it.  Beware of GWL - Livmore."
384,ROCK RIDGE INVESTMENTS,ETOBICOKE,"As a resident of***** The landlord does not care for it's current and older residents since they do not want to foot the bill on necessary repairs and provide adequate services. The building maintenance staff are the most incompetent and disgusting individuals I have ever met, they do not respect their residents and refuse to keep up with the cleanliness and safety of the building. They are rude, lack empathy and don't know how to do repairs, I am surprised the building hasn't caved in on itself by now. This should also explain the high turnover rate since none of the staff stick around long enough, not to mention residents have no way of contacting the landlord directly since they never disclose that information and keep us in the dark, so we must suffer in silence and write reviews like this to get our voices heard. What a dump, if you are desperate for housing please look elsewhere."
385,JOE ADDEO/NAT CAPALBO,NORTH YORK,"Joe and Nat were fantastic! Repaired anything as soon as possible or replaced appliances that broke as soon as possible, when the fridge broke they brought me a mini fridge to use while waiting on delivery of a new one. When I went out of town they were kind enough to check on my cat for me as well. Upon first moving in they had a lovely welcome basket with fresh bakery buns. They never raised rent through my 3.5 years of tenancy. Always provided ample notice if they needed access to my apartment as well."
386,PATRY INC,KINGSTON,"Patry fails to fix critical issues such as leaks in a timely manner. They often lose documentation (key deposit forms), fail to take out rent automatically then suggest you didn't pay rent and will be evicted, and more. They offer cheap student housing but at a price of bad communication and disorganization."
387,DANIELS,MISSISSAUGA,"I have rented with daniels for several years.  Extremely responsive for repairs.  If they like you as a tenant, they will not keep increasing your rent."
388,HAZELVIEW / TIMBERCREEK,TORONTO,"Hazelview is not in the business of being a landlord; they're interested in pushing out older tenants and flipping the units as fast as possible for higher rents, or just to sell the building. They're speculators. We have endured years of incredibly loud and shoddy renovations to common and exterior areas (which no one requested) while basic maintenance inside actual units (which many have indeed requested) goes undone. The point of this effort is to make living here as unpleasant as possible right now while also ensuring they've got a nice glossy brochure at the end to pitch to new tenants. Staff in the main office are generally disrespectful and incompetent. We regularly get threatening notices under our door for things that aren't illegal and that we haven't even done; they send these out to the entire building. ""Do X or you could face eviction"", ""Do Y or you could face eviction"". Meanwhile the near-weekly disruptions to hydro, water, and even mail delivery have continued for years."
389,SAGE LIVING MANAGEMENT INC.,KINGSTON,"Worst experience I have ever had. DO NOT RENT FROM SAGE KINGSTON. The building is poorly managed, and they shirk any major issues onto the the unit ""owners"" (who are usually just investors) who receive little information on any unit issues, which can lead to major delays in getting any major issues fixed. Beyond that, the company cannot manage garbage disposal, and there are frequent fire alarms. Avoid at all costs, some units are lovely, but if you get the wrong unit you could be at a huge risk."
390,KING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"Overall good living conditions. Landlord barges in after***** Parking is extra $60 for outside parking, which forces people to park*****"
391,STERLING KALAMAR,TORONTO,The management in this location decided to illegaly enter my apartment without prior notice and changed the locks on my door because of a ridiculous reason. I had to call the police and the police had to come and inform the management that they cannot change my locks without court approval or enter my unit without consent
392,ADRIANO BARROS,TORONTO,We had a horrible experience with the landlord at this address. The landlord's sister shouted at us consistently; police sometimes came to the building to ensure our safety. The landlord locked the heating/cooling system panel even though we are responsible for the hydro and gas bills. A neighbour mentioned the landlord put a ladder to peek at us through one of the windows.
393,OREST DZULYNSKY,TORONTO,"Orest was a private landlord and generally an agreeable and likeable person, however the unit was in disrepair and fell well beneath habitable condition standards. It appears to be a case of letting the building rot until he decides to sell to a developer one day. The unit is not properly insulated (freezing in the winter, stifling in the summer). The main windows do not open (one window that opened in the entire unit) so the renter must keep the balcony door open for any airflow.

The only heating/cooling came from a lone wall unit. The unit was not powerful enough to reach the bedroom. The hydro bill was so astronomical living there that running the heater or air conditioning enough to properly cool or heat the apartment would bankrupt a renter (on average $*****/month in the winter, without running it consistently).
 
The apartment had a pest problem which Orest chose to ignore. There were loud sounds of animals in the ceiling (scratching, movement, burrowing). When he was informed of the issue, he said the animals would ""find their way out eventually."" Then there was a mouse problem. Again he refused to send any sort of exterminators and said it was too costly. I ended up taking on the issue myself, sealing up holes in the walls that were the result of shoddy installation (huge holes/gaps behind all appliances—guess where the mice came in from). 

Finally, when leaving the apartment, it was revealed the dryer had been installed incorrectly and was a massive fire hazard. The maintenance person fixed the hazard but it was startling to find out the reason the dryer didn't work very well was also what could have led to a possible fire. 

Upon leaving the apartment I saw they had jacked up the price by about $*****. So whoever moved in after I left doesn't have any holes in the walls anymore, but is paying more for something that must be crumbling by now."
394,TOM CROUTCH/SUSAN PETTY,JACKSON’S POINT,"(When I rented from them) Zero ventilation on the upper floor besides two small windows, no insulation in the upper walls. It got so cold the windows would freeze shut, melt when it got warm which dripped everywhere and caused mildew. The ceiling on the lower floor was like Swiss cheese with the amount of holes in it from constant never ending leaks/water damage. Their large untrained dog was aggressive and lunged at the door I walked by in the shared hallway to leave every single time I left. When I refused an illegal rent increase, Tom and Sue began doing things like removing front porch light bulbs so I couldn’t see where I was going, making comments outside my door… I assume to try to make me leave. Very dirty and hazardous common areas as well. They also stayed home chain smoking all day and all night inside the house during COVID lockdown and my SIX year old cat died of an aggressive form of cancer three months after I moved out. Also found my mailed tax return opened and taped back up. I’m sure they’d say that’s all just a coincidence. AVOID THESE SLUMLORDS."

When he purchased the property the rental property I came in situ him and his real estate agent harassed and coerced me into signing a new lease stating new owner new lease. New owner new lease. Well I’ve come to find that’s incorrect. I have been to the landlord tenant board three times in the last two years with this landlord and the landlord tenant board in Ontario agreed with me so the original lease that I signed in***** I lived with sewer water coming up from the base of the toilet I lived with sewer flies, coming up from the drain that he did not cover in the kitchen. This man has harassed me. and my family.  We have to go to landlord tenant board June 20,***** Again his name is Francis J AREECKAL.  Stay far away from this man he is a con man and a fraud"
399,LEABRACORE INC.,TORONTO,"Great landlord. We moved it when it was newly renovated, and the apartment has a decent size for a two-bedroom. The landlord even proactively offer plans to the tenants during early COVID. 

The only downside of the apartment is soundproofing."
400,VINCE PINGUE,ST CATHARINES,"Does not respect the lease agreements , tries to skirt on signed documents by disputing contractual facts. TV and Internet were originally provided as part of rent now removed without notice and gaslighting tenants when abatement brought up. Repairs are always rudimentary ( minimum possible) at best. If dealing with this landlord always be on top of things."
401,GRAND RIVER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,Best building I have ever lived in.
402,ENDERBY DEVELOPMENT,TORONTO,Overall not terrible landlords but they are a fan of the Band-Aid solution versus actual effective repairs. Could be better.... could be worse.
403,ARMAND BEDIRIAN,OTTAWA,"Landlord rating : 4/10. Confrontational and email spammer.  Doesn’t abide by his word. Revokes verbal agreements. Harasses you with multiple emails expecting an answer right away but, when asked for repairs or work to be done, takes over***** Building infested with silverfish. Reoccurring issue year after year. (They crawl on your kitchen counters) Doesn’t do monthly upkeep of common spaces. All in all this is the worst landlord that I had to deal with in all of my rentals. All communications must be via email now because this person would scream at you during a conversation. I have no tolerance for abusive behaviour. Renters be warned. Have everything in writing!"
404,BARNEY RIVER,TORONTO,Worst landlord.
405,SHAHAB SIDDIQUI,TORONTO,"This Landlord is trying to evict me for zero cause because he said he can’t afford the mortgage. Called to tell me then emailed me with no knowledge of the Tenant Laws. Please be careful as his lack of knowledge can be stressful for someone who does not know your Tenant Rights.  This is illegal, my unit was also occupied before the November 15,***** date for rent increases."
406,1971600 ONTARIO INC,OTTAWA,"Alessandro was an exceptional landlord. He provided all kinds of proper communication, such as forwarding emails from condo board. The place was ready as promised, and in great shape. When there was an issue with the oven, he was quick to get it solved and apologized for the inconvenience. When a neighbour had a complaint, he brought it up in a polite and respectful manner. Great person. I wish more landlords were like him!"
407,DMS PROPERTY RICHMOND HILL MARSHALL STREET,RICHMOND HILL,"This bulding is always dirty, the supindentant does not know how to maintein a bulding. He is so lazy and ignore people when they ask to fix things in units. The lady denis in the office does not answer your call and all shes is doing is raising people’s rents. They needs to get these people out and out better people to make this bulding better. The rent is so very high, the worker, office lady denis and supindentant Ross is very lazy, why dms pay then we don’t know. They don’t work get better people there to fix this bulding, hurry up and fix this bulding. Too many bugs, ants, rodents in this is bulding. So gross there."

410,GARRY JENEREAUX,BURKS FALLS,"He is the worst slumlord. He is trying to perform another illegal rent increase for the third time.  Nothing is being cleaned or maintained. We also have to tolerate his drunk son who also lives in the building, whom has treatened to fight my husband twice. He has treated to evict us if we dont comply with said illegal rent increase."
411,COLIN POPONNE,TORONTO,"A slippery, deceptive guy whose word cannot be trusted in my experience. From our neighbours, we've heard that has had issues with almost all of his previous tenants. He has threatened us by saying that he has ""family is interested in the unit"" while attempting to raise our rent 3x the legal limit. One tenant was forced to pay***** (they were international students who Colin took advantage of, he cited to them it was standard in a 'very competitive market'). We were told he has refused to return deposits, and has that he attempted to charge tenants for landscaping fees. After a storm, a fence fell between the neighbour's property and his but he refused to pay for his half so now there's only half of a fence dividing the properties. He has offered more parking spaces to tenants than spaces available in order to charge higher rent. One of his basement suites is illegal (they don't have their own address, they don't pay for their own utilities, they don't have a fire exit, and the ceilings are less than 6ft tall throughout). The basement unit had mold growing on their ceiling due to a leak, but instead of addressing it, he painted over it and then blamed the tenants who moved in next for the mold when in penetrated the paint. Many issues we flagged the week we moved in have not been addressed (broken laundry dryer vent, hole in the wall, leaking kitchen sink, huge ice blocks that continually build up in the freezer, none of our inside doors fully close). We had pest issues when we first moved in that he didn't address, we had to handle on our own and he never paid us back $***** for the traps/preventative measures we took (despite his verbal confirmation he would and after we provided all of the receipts). We have had a 0/10 experience with Colin."
412,MELANIE CUPALO,TORONTO,I lived in a unit rented by Melanie for many years. Melanie was a very “hands off” landlord in the best way. By that I mean she left me alone and we only really connected until I needed something fixed in the unit she and was always so quick and courteous to resolve any issue I had. Melanie also went above and beyond to make me feel valued as a good tenant.
413,DEREK WHETHERELL,SAINT CATHARINES,"Derek owned some great properties with great locations, large bedrooms and large windows. The experience of living here came at its expense though. For one, there was no inspection from the move-out from the previous tenants to when I moved in. House was cluttered with garbage, old belongings and animal *****. Several parts of the house needed repair, and Derek would hesitate to believe me when we would describe the issue and even when identified, would take several days or weeks to repair. 

It's stated in the lease that tenants have no ownership of garages and sheds, which is agreeable. But because these units are used for the landlord's personal storage, I found on several occasions, my driveway would be occupied for the purpose of large equipment being loaded. Though nobody was entering the property, it would at times block tenants from entering or exiting the driveway, which was a disruption for students with back-to-back schedules, relying on the use of a safe driveway,"

It’s a bachelor unit and bed frame was broke yet he made us replace it with not even half the amount of compensation that we paid for it. Fire alarm died about***** Told him and ghosted me about when he would replace it. Currently the dishwasher is fully broken (won’t drain properly or clean without 2-3 cycles). Don’t recommend. Thankfully we saved up for a house this year and are moving out in august of this year."

417,JOHN ASHIE,KINGSTON,John was a great landlord! Very fair and pleasant and we had no issues with him.
418,ANDREY NIKOLAEV,TORONTO,"Repairs were all done by Andrey.  He did unlicensed electrical work, and instead of paying to have things wired through the building, he'd set up extension cords through the ceiling.  Painted over everything, wires painted down to the walls. He was constantly trying to come into the small apartment to check on things and do work.  I was genuinely afraid for my safety living in a building he managed.  "
419,GEORGE CHIANG (BEAUNEST PROPERTY SERVICES),TORONTO,"History of renovictions including myself (search their name and ""renoviction"" for proof). Would Airbnb other units in the building, with multiple parties and disrespectful guests. Had to fight multiple times in the Landlord Tenant Board since they would incorrectly fill out N12s and other documents. You couldn't pay me to live in one of their properties ever gain."
420,ROMAN AND MARY SZYMCZAK,TORONTO,"Roman and Mary were lovely landlords. An older couple who intentionally kept rent affordable to give young people a chance to save. Always gave notice before entering the property, gave us hand-me-down dishware and silverware, dropped off flowers for the holidays, and were always available for repairs. They kept the garden in great condition and mediated issues between tenants. When it was time to move out, they gave plenty of notice for showings and held them on weekends as we worked from home. They ask their tenants to write them letters of recommendation for future tenants, which shows how much they care about the people renting from them. Truly a kind, generous duo!"
421,KAJATHEEPH PARAMESHWARANATHAN,OSHAWA,"Landlord also goes by Kajan Nathan
My girlfriend and I moved into***** for our first apt together. We were very excited to start the next chapter of our lives together and thought this was the perfect place for us. 
Over the course of the total***** heat/air conditioning, lack of CO detectors, the landlord himself as well as his mother constantly invading our space through the shared laundry room (mainly to yell down for our attn to tell us to do something, or that we have done something they didn't like, such as too long of a laundry cycle); all to conclude with us finding out the apt was never legal in the first place, forcing us to move out long before the initial agreement expired.

His mother was CONSTANTLY on the phone just outside of the shared laundry room door leading into our apt, we were ALWAYS hearing extremely loud conversations over the phone in another language. Brought this up many times to no avail. The mother would also come into the bsmt, yell for us, and boss us around. 
We finally had enough about***** 
We then received a call from bylaw the next day that the house our apt was located was not legally certified.

422,ANSON THARSIOUS & PAKEERATHAN KANDIAH,WELLAND,"This landlord is horrible to deal with and owns several properties in Welland. They don't understand first and last month policies, don't understand utilities or lease lengths. Asked for way too much personal information (beyond what is legal) and when I fought back, they backed down. They don't repair their properties and don't follow the rules when it comes to leases. They've been in collections with utility providers so many times and we've had utilities cut so many times that we've just put utilities in our own name even though that wasn't the original agreement. It's hard to tell whether they are consciously incompetent or unconsciously incompetent, but either way... Please stay clear."
423,MILTON MOHAMMED,OTTAWA,Bought too many properties and cannot afford upkeep.  Intimidation tactics used in effort to cause a tenant to move out.  Blindly accused a tenant of intentionally causing damage. Unit has had broken fireplace since contract signed (8 yrs ago) and will not replace unit. Needs wiring updated (many items on hydro meter not in apartment). Needs kitchen upgrade. Wouldn't empty furnace room of dangerous items until Fire Authority involved. leaky windows. Does nothing about skunk in back yard.
424,MICHELE BOGDANOWICZ,TORONTO,"I loved in the basement unit of this house for about***** I was subjected to frequent entry without sufficient notices for non emergencies. 
The landlord did DIY repairs resulting in major issues that caused me to be out of my unit while being repaired by professionals. 
My privacy was violated by having drawers gone through and personal items broken. 
Constant noise as the landlords are musicians/singers. 
their children often cross boundaries and ask very personal questions, when you correct the child the mother seems upset.
Revolving door on the main floor as people break their lease due to the difficult living situations. 
The female landlord was in my apartment every single weekend for any given reason
 I had to be out of my home every weekend while she was in there doing nothing but listening to a radio and pretending to do work in my unit. It was a literal nightmare.
When I finally gave notice, she was unwilling to compromise when showi g the apartment during work hours (worked from home). When I finally moved out, she was in the way gardening in the yard and allowing her children to be in the way of us moving. Worst experience and as a result I will not be renting a basement apartment ever again. After I moved they were taken to landlord and tenant board by the main floor neighbours. Do not rent here!"
425,SHELHA AND IZHAR MIRZA,TORONTO,"Izhar & Shelha are no longer our landlords as we've since moved, but I wanted to share our review in case it helps save others from a similar ordeal we experienced.  We were renting a small townhouse unit in Toronto from Izhar & Shelha (less than***** ft) for roughly*****  Here's a list of some faults by category:
- Rent Increases: Asked continuously to increase rent above the federal guidelines without valid reasons as outlined by the Residential Tenancies Act. Challenged the effective rent increase dates as they never gave notice of rent increases on time.
- Deposits: Requested key deposit of $***** which is higher than the legal amount they should have requested.  Locks were never replaced before we moved into the unit and they refused to change the locks/keys at our request.  Asked for an additional deposit of month's rent (in addition to first & last). Kept the key deposit after keys were returned.
- Repairs:  They blamed us for damage that existed prior to us moving into the unit and challenged us on this until we found an old listing that was still active with photos of the damage.  Would not fix issues reported to them (eg. roof needed repair for***** - wanted us to repair dmg). Stated we did not need a new washer/dryer when washer broke (part of our lease).  Asked us to repair small things including leaking plumbing and missing vent caps. Refused to pay us back for hired plumbers even after stating they'll pay.
- Privacy:  Attempted to enter unit 2x without notice while we were sleeping.  Hired roofer without informing us work was being done and they saw my gf showering from the upstairs washroom window.
- Eviction:  claimed they wanted to move their daughter in but listed at 40% higher rent a week later. 
- Integrity: new listing after we moved stated 2,***** sq ft (it's***** reality).  Staged to look lived in after vacant home tax went in effect.

I've hit the character limit, so.."
426,CHARLIE DIAO,RICHMOND HILL,Anything and everything I contacted the landlord for was met with resistance and hostility. I have had nothing but constant issues with the home since the day I moved in. Every time I contacted the landlord and asked for help he told me that he would not be doing anything regarding repairing the house. There were numerous problems with the home a leaking foundation holes in the roof and the list goes on. It wasn't until the basement flooded that the landlord decided that he would do anything to repair the home. When I had to contact him regarding issues with the home he was rude and disrespectful. Needless to say I will not be staying here much longer
427,TERRACORP,LONDON,"Waited a long time for repairs for both a new fridge (mine wasn't working at all for almost a month) and new toilet (would make an EXTREMELY loud noise when flushed, like a loud rattling, scared the **** out of me and sounded like something was gonna break). Entry notifications for repairs etc were not followed (eg. get a notification they'll come on one day, but they actually come a day early). When I lived there, they advertised the rent at a certain amount but that's actually after a ""pay on time discount"" - so, effectively, you are charged if you pay late. If you are late you need a money order ($25) or you have to go to their office and pay in person (office isn't in the building, it's downtown, and only open during the day). No option to pay online, at least when I lived there. When I moved out, they relisted the apartment at DOUBLE what I was paying in rent, without doing any repairs or even removing the old carpet."
428,DOUG AND BARBARA THOMPSON,CANNIFTON,"Mr. And Mrs Thompson are exceptional landlords, who have been providing affordable and safe homes to their tenants. Rents are reasonable compared to current rates, and they pride themselves in providing safe, clean, well maintained properties."
429,STERLING KARAMAR,LONDON,"The Good: Building manager seems like a good dude, sound doesn't travel easily between units, privacy feels respected, usually good notice of fire alarm inspections, etc.

The Bad: I've waited more than a month for repairs before, and they won't deal with the underlying issue, creating an ongoing safety hazard. The building has***** (I remember one was down for six weeks at the end of *****). There is an exercise room but it is only open from 9am-9pm and has very few machines, so good luck.

The ""Not that bad, but annoying"": Communication often contradictory - one notice said construction would take***** Often receive notices that have things like ""[building manager's name here]"" still in the document."
430,ST JOSEPHS SENIORS CURZON,TORONTO,Fabulous management and the very best couple who do the daily care of this building.
431,TINA & DEREK QUIGLEY,BARRIE,"My landlords seemed amazing - polite, gave me warning if they needed to enter the unit, responded promptly to fixing things in the house ... until it was time to move out. In the***** I've rented, I've NEVER had issues. When it was time to move out, they tried to blame me for pre-existing issues/damage to their property. I had rented/lived in their townhouse for***** walls/paint. This is considered normal wear and tear especially for a long duration rental. They threatened me by saying they took past tenants to court, thus implying an impending threat of legal action.  In the end, I sought legal advise, and once I replied showing that I was informed about my rights as per the Landlord/Tenant Agreement Act, nothing came out of it. However it created a lot of unnecessary stress. Beware!"
432,STEVE BYRNE,OTTAWA,"Bad
- Did not deal with cockroaches in a timely manner
- Did not deal with ant infestation at all
- Did not make repairs, even upon request
- Refused to accept anything other than cheques handed in-person
- His wife threatened to evict us for no good reason multiple times. Once, for being loud on Christmas (we had four guests who were gone before 10:00 pm)

433,REALSTAR,KITCHENER,"This is advertised as a luxury apartment complex, but the money paid for rent for the unit doesn't match the condition of common areas and the amenities offered. The units themselves are nice, and they do paint them when tenants change and make sure they are clean - no complaints here.  I haven't had any problems with management - they are all very pleasant to deal with and have never been rude or abrupt with me.  My issue is with the general cleanliness of the three buildings - there is no proactive approach.  For example, the garbage chutes are always dirty and it's gross (the exterior door you pull open and the interior flap). Not sure why they can't include wiping them as part of the weekly cycle when they are vacuuming the place.  Also, no one can explain to me why they shut down the recyle/organics after 5pm and on weekends so all garbage goes directly to actual garbage outside of 8-5.  There is ridiculous in this day and age and should not be happening. Dog pee stains on the carpet are never properly cleaned.  When mentioned, they say ""It's been cleaned"" which I know they did, but perhaps use something different that works? It looks revolting walking through the lobby with dog pee stains all over the place.  There isn't a regular **** patrol of their grounds so it's most often disgusting as alot of people don't clean up after their pets and I don't get the sense they think they should do it even though it's their property. Either figure out who is doing that and deal with it, or clean it up regularly.  The rooftop patio is closed again ""until further notice"". This is one of the reasons I moved here and they give no idea when it will be reopened. The gym is way, way too small for the number of tenants they have so it's impossible to use at times. I feel luxury buildings should have a better approach to regular maintenance than what is currently being done here - the issues I raised are a common thread among tenants here."
434,TORONTO PUBLIC HOUSING COMPANY,NORTH YORK,"This is the worst experience of my life is a recurring nightmare, for a long term renter who has never had a problem except for the slum lords taking over the city. Also I'm on the public record they are doing everything to prevent to improve by attributing substandard services in exchange for low rent to keep behind swindled always a threat for becoming streetbound and are keeping offended by not owning up.  I have repeatedly tried to get a priority transfer and due to massive prejudice on socio economic bias have oppressed. I'm on the public record that seem to matter not to them and I would like to ask the judge JPs and adjudicators  to answer this : if your money is expendable then does this fact make you expendable too ?"
435,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"So many tenants smokes here!!! Not children friendly. The staircase is full of smoke. Hall ways smell like smoke. I live on the 20th floor and my balcony has smoke buds. Management doesn’t care. I even smell smoke through my vents. They don’t care about tenants smoking in their unit or staircase. If you smoke, this is paradise for you. Do not move here if you have children or care about your health"
436,YI CHEN,TORONTO,"Non rent controlled building, raised rent by over half a grand a month to force us to move"
437,GREAT WEST LIFE REALTY ADVISORS,TORONTO,"There's a cluster of apartment buildings in High Park North, half of which are managed by Minto (decent company), the other half managed by GWL, the property owner's rental agent/subsidiary. Predatory rentals. They find the flimsiest reasons to raise rents, and to apply for AGIs from the ministry. They even tried this at the height of the pandemic, when rents were frozen. This is how much they disrespect people. 
I had an elderly neighbour who asked to switch units because of bright sunlight. They agreed, and though she'd been long term and her utilities were included, they said nothing, and then sent her utilities to private companies. Her first hydro bill was in the hundreds of dollars. I tried to help with that, but during pandemic there was NOBODY in the offices, and services ground to a halt. I am SO glad I got out of there. If you're in one of the LivMore buildings, take note: these are recent builds, and they are not subject to rent control. If you're flush with cash this isn't a problem, but who really wants to pay up to *****$ for an apartment, especially if the service is poor, and if the rent will increase above the provincial average annually??
I've moved, and am so happy I did. But you know what they did? They claimed I owed them money I'd not paid on an (illegal) increase for *****, refused to discuss it despite the fact that increases were legislated during the worst of the pandemic, and when I moved, they sent a collection agency after me, before I had an opportunity to get legal advice. Awful. Awful with glitter on it.. Stay away from these people.  All they want are signed leases, and then you're on your own. Shame is that the buildings were decent before Vertica (ugh) and rebranded Vertica began to manage them. 
One of their employees actually said to me once, ""Well, I don't care: I can't afford to live here"".  Think of this if you're considering a rental by High Park station."
438,BAYTREE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,They have responded quickly and effectively to maintenance requests and otherwise given us privacy.

I decided to agree and ask for compensation. I gave my first month rent for January and February I paid half of the rent and they were supposed to return me the last month payment if I left by end of april and my key deposit. Her husband came to collect the keys and tricked me by handing over someone else’s cheque and by saying that he left the cheque at home When I opened the envelope with the fraud cheque. They owe me***** He took the keys and told me they will drop it to my new home. After that neither of them reached out to me or received any call. They didn’t fulfil the compensation which was supposed to be provided. I have filled a T1 against them and still pending.
442,MARIA GALIPO,TORONTO,"A fairly reasonable and professional landlord. My only criticism would be her family - Galipo tends to get (unqualified) family members to do repairs and maintenance to avoid having to pay for professionals. They also tend to hang out at the front of the building, smoking and drinking with their friends. I was never bothered by them directly, but it was pretty annoying at times to come home to that (they don't live in the building)."

444,JERUDAN DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED,TORONTO,The buildings are old and do need a fair bit of repair but I've found both management and superintendent to be fair and accommodating. There are a number of rotten apples as tenants who ruin the friendly atmosphere and are a constant source of complaints and unreasonable demands. I've never had an issue with getting a repair done and I find that being a decent tenant usually gets you what you deserve.

447,KELLY CRANSTON,BARRHAVEN,"Beautiful home that is up to code, terrible owner who had zero experience with being a landlord. Her husband was great, but after they divorced she took over communications with us. She was extremely rude during our move out walk-through (which she evicted us after***** divorce) and sent emails and texts at 1am harassing us over a non-issue. Kelly even tried to coax us back to the house under the pretense that she was withholding our mail - which is illegal to do. Really immature behaviour from an adult woman and registered dental hygienist. Look elsewhere for and avoid*****"
448,BRYAN DALPHY,OTTAWA,"Tried to raise the rent above the allowed amount. He prefers renting to students short-term so he can raise the rent in between tenancies. Did not schedule regular maintenance, so our furnace broke down a few times, but did get it fixed within a reasonable amount of time. Very difficult to communicate with. He did take care of a bug problem when asked. Was overall an okay experience."
449,JASMINE WALTERS,MISSISSAUGA,"I wouldn’t recommend renting from Jasmine, she can be sweet but she doesn’t act mature for her age and her communication lacks a lot. She may be extremely sweet at first but in a few months she will act like she hates u and doesn’t know u."
450,MOHAMMED AND ELNAZ,KANATA LAKES,"Respectful landlords overall and are quick to respond to regular maintenance problems. Except the relationship quickly dissolved when we were evicted in bad faith due to ""selling the property"" after we denied an illegal rent increase they wanted that well over the legal rent control amount. After we moved out they relisted the place for rent at a substantially higher amount. Being a fabulous 10/10 tenant means nothing to newbie landlords. Don't forget this is a business transaction only, and you may end up facing something similar with them."
451,GUS VAGENAS,TORONTO,"Gus is an enigma of disrespect - he regularly breaks the RTA, sets 'rules' (like no courier or package delivery to door) that go against RTA, and still tries (keyword tries) to weaponize the RTA that he doesn't follow or understand when he is personally upset with tenants. He has to be repeatedly reminded of maintenance requests, hires sloppy contractors who have created paths for yearly mice infestations (in areas of the units the heat exchangers from that project now occupy and block access to - yay! disease air), and has asked numerous tenants for illegal rent increases on bogus grounds. At one point he tried to slip an extra $10 into the calculation of my neighbour's yearly board increase, under the guise of it being a calculated 2.5%

It is almost like Gus cares about his building, but he is completely uneducated to the responsibilities of his position and obligations under the RTA. He mops the floors, he upgrades things occasionally, but he is constantly trampling on tenants rights out of some bizarre sense of possessiveness. You'd think that possessiveness would drive him to maintain these units as well, but good luck getting him to fix something without a chorus of hassling.  He has become more unhinged over time and I would avoid renting from him."
452,AMARABANDU WICKRAMATUNGA,HAMILTON,Did not take exterminate cockroaches. Had to buy own batteries and buy own smoke dector. Did not provide proper safe living environment. Did not respond to emails and then changed number. Although mcmaster was close by and I could walk to school it was a terrible environment and I would not recommend to anyone. Will be leaving once the sem is over. Not nice people at all.
453,JOE AND TERRI CORDEIRO,LONDON,"Joe and Terri are one of the best Landlords I've had. They are fair, on top of things, respectful and reachable. These attributes are very important to me and many Tenants. I've been super happy and lucky to have them for my Landlord.
:)"
454,RAY FONG,TORONTO,"Ray was a fantastic landlord from start to finish. On the occasion something needed to be fixed, I coordinated the cost with him and he sent an e-transfer, or came to fix the problem himself. Otherwise he was very hands-off and respectful and raised the rent year over year the minimum amount (I believe just a cost of living increase)."
455,"MINJU KANG(JACQUELINE), MIHEE KANG",TORONTO,"Dealing with Minju Kang and her mother, Mihee Kang, was a nightmare. They were demanding, blaming, dismissive, and disrespectful toward their tenants. One major issue was a leak in the bedroom ceiling, which was neglected by the landlord until the end of my tenancy. When they finally showed up, they covered it with paint to HIDE it. Rent was increased by seven hundred for two years, despite their promises they'd follow rent increase guidelines in Ontario. They blamed me for the unit not being rented out, though they posted a higher price, neglected and ignored to fix the unit. They never returned the key deposit, claiming they need to pay for cleaning and painting.

I left the property fairly clean(even steamed the floor). I just wanted to be respectful until the end of the tenancy. All the ""dirtiness"" they pointed out was some dust in the drawers and fridge and some scratches on the outside of the entry door(which the building management properly inspected that I didn't do any damage when I moved in and out), and stains on the wall caused by sunlight or furniture due to natural use. The building has issues raised by other units, but they blamed me for taking $***** key deposit. They were confrontational and spoke in Korean conveniently when I tried to argue. This was completely unfair and unreasonable, but I didn't want to spend any more minutes with the hopeless people, so I let them keep the deposit.

Overall, I strongly advise against renting from them, but if you unfortunately already moved in, make sure ALL damages on the ceilings (there are so many cracks adjacent to walls and ceilings, but especially the bedroom has a leak at the north side corner window) and water pressure are fixed, the unit is PROFESSIONALLY cleaned and NEWLY painted, as that's what they took my key deposit for, and most importantly, scrutinize the unit before you move in and demand that they PROPERLY FIX any issues you find to avoid them blaming you when you leave."
456,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"The most scammer company I've ever seen in my life. Avoid York Property Management. If you want to have a daily fight with someone, choose York Property Management. They're good at scamming tenants. So far, five tenants in this building have filed applications against York Property Management."
457,JEREMY FINE,TORONTO,"Be very cautious with him!

I am going on two years of living in one of his many rentals. The units he owns seem to all be in desperate repair. You must know what your rights are and be prepared to fight for them. Every turn he has tried to con us. Here are just some examples:
1) Tried to charge us because we did not shovel the sidewalk snow in front of the house. We had an argument through email, citing many times over per our lease and the landlord and tenant act outside maintenance is the landlord's responsibility. 
2) Every maintenance request we have filed was an ordeal. After almost two years parts of the house still flood and have extreme water damage during rain. We have sent videos and requests for repair and nothing.
3) Like the other response here. We found mold in the bathrooms and he told us to go buy mold cleaner form Home Hardware and do it ourselves.
4) Times when contractors do come to do repairs we are not notified and they often do a horrible job. We complained that*****
5) When we asked him about getting a pet he said no and that he does not allow pets. We again cited how that is not legal in Ontario and he simply replied back with "" you are right""
6) We had bikes in the backyard that was only accessible through a locked gate. One day when the contractors came to fix a pipe in the backyard, again with no notice, two of the bikes went missing by the end of the day. This has not been remedied yet. 

He is incredibly frustrating as he will try to violate so much of the Landlord and Tenant Act but once you quote it and show him you know he bends. Times when we have spoken he does not know who I am or even what unit the address is. He clearly does not care at all about the properties he owns or the people who are living there. DO NOT RENT!"
458,LISA LIU,MARKHAM,"Lisa is a very good Landlord, can't find anything to complaint!"
459,GOLDEN EQUITY,OTTAWA,"Absolutely awful. If you miss rent, they will ignore your explanations and they will illegally cut your power and lock your breaker room up. They enter without notice, slam doors, and leave garbage everywhere. They don't shovel in the winter and leave tenants garbage all over the property in the summer. They make fun of our belongings and our living situation in our hall. They leave our front doors wide open and unlocked and then claim we did it, despite not even being home. We've had intoxicated neighbors and random kids enter our house and when we reported it, they just claimed we had reports against us leaving the doors open. They dump plaster and paint into our own personal garbage bins. They ignore and block maintenance requests by turning off settings on your tenant portal. They are negligent and left the upstairs unit unheated all winter which lead to burst pipes and flooding in our unit.  They did nothing to help us. It took them four days to call a plumber. Somehow, despite coming in and seeing the two inches of water on our floor, because we turned off the water ourselves, they claimed there was no leak. They left drywall all over the floor in the hall,  which we ended up cleaning up after a month because it was covered in mold. It took them three months to patch up the walls. They didn't replace any wet insulation or drywall and told us a mold inspection wasn't necessary. They only did this because they're now renting out upstairs for profit. We expressed concerns about mold within the wall and we were belittled and gaslighted. Amber Lynn is awful. She is unprofessional, dismissive and defensive. Her emails are always a run on sentence with spelling mistakes, telling us why we're wrong and not how they can help us. Do not rent from them."
460,SAJIDA (TINA) JAFRI,TORONTO,"We came to look at the rental and it was a little messy. Unpatched holes in the walls and sawdust on the floor. We figured it would be cleaned by the time we moved in, and it wasn't. They didn't do anything between the open home and move in.

Turns out they converted a single family home without making any of the necessary adjustments. The electrical panel was wired as a single family home, which meant multiple rooms on different floors were on a single circuit. The entire kitchen and half our floor was on the same circuit as downstairs. so the power cut constantly if we used multiple devices at once. We told the landlords and they did nothing. We didn't have access to the breakers, so if the basement tenants were out we were screwed. One weekend it went out and they refused to reset the breaker. They told us to buy an extension cord to power our entire kitchen for the weekend then return it for a refund later.

They blamed us every time something went wrong and any repairs took upwards of weeks, or they didn't happen. The fridge leaked for almost a year before they finally replaced it. The doors were too small for the frame, which meant all of the sound leaked and we had no privacy from the downstairs tenants. We could constantly hear each other. The dryer constantly broke and when they fixed it, they did it with a non-compatible machine and the machines would move when they operated. Our unit would rumble and because the doors were too small the sound drowned out whatever we were doing.

When we decided to move on, they'd either give us an hour's notice that people were coming by to see the unit, or just show up with viewers. We always paid rent on time and told them in advance of any issues. There was a high turnover of renters, and everyone we talked to said it was because of the terrible landlords.

It's a pity, because the place was in a great neighbourhood, had a beautiful balcony and lots of potential, but wasn't maintained."
461,CHRIS AND KELLY COLLISON,ST MARYS,"Chris was so bad as a landlord and disgustingly rude. I asked for a security light at side of building because the shed and parking area was dark and he said ""get it yourself""  they were bat droppings from the attic. One day he tried to enter my apartment thinking u was not home but i changed the door code. 
He would not do repairs at all. 
Did not respect privacy.

Worst landlord ever. Worst person ever Do not rent from him or her."
462,WILLIAMS PARK MANAGEMENT,STRATFORD,"Both the mangers of railway Ave apartments are drunks.. They spend more time drinking with the neighbours than addressing anything between each building they manage...

Even trying to be curious as I moved out and repainted and did minor renovations. They never informed me of a*****

Sad this is what renting is like now, people in a position where they can legit lie and get away with it"
463,DEAN SOUFAN,LONDON,"Worst landlord ever. He will take your deposit, throw your stuff outside and force you to live in a difficult situation"
464,STERLING KARAMAR,NORTH YORK,"The property management of Sterling Karamar for***** For your reference I can recommend, you just visit the parking and around the buildings."
465,YORK MANGEMENT,INGERSOLL,"Both the property managers if***** don't care about the health and safety of the tenants. As I was living there when the no smoking ban was put in. The onsite manager had the audacity to tell a mother with a new born child, to just suck up the smoke smell from their apartment. Besides the fact her husband is very abusive to younger people.. His approach isn't to introduce himself but instead scream and yell at you....

I had asked for over a year to have our bathroom repaired for black mold and water damage, I was asked to leave my own home before he would do such and out right refused if I was there for the very sloppy repair work.

Both these people should be charged with negligence and not doing what they are required to do

Such as one comment from her husband

""if you expecting things fixed you should have bought a condo"""
466,MOSTAFA RAJABIAN,TORONTO,"Disrespectful and greedy landlord, only really cares about himself and his money. He's a realtor so he should know what's right and what's wrong, but will still do whatever he wants. When I applied to rent his place, I didn't know that landlords weren't allowed to require a security deposit so I gave one. Six months later, after I learned a bit more about tenants' rights and etc, I asked for it back and he was so dismissive. This is just one example of his character. Do not rent from him."
467,NORTHVIEW PROPERTY,KANATA,"If I had know what I was in for, I would have never rented from these guys. Well we were there, the company changed***** We had a HUGE leak in our unit that lasted almost***** The whole time we were made to live there and help with the repairs, even though it wasnt our fault."
468,NICK ATALICK,ST CATHARINES,"I lived for a year at***** — a building owned by Nick Atalick. Here is just SOME of what went on…
1. The place was infested with cockroaches.
2. We were constantly getting harassing papers tapped on our doors about people coming inside, not allowing people to store bikes inside, not allowing e XYZ (basically you’re not allowed to exist)
3. We were forced to leave our bikes in a storage place outside that was not secure which resulted in both our bikes getting vandalized. 
4. No parking was thought out or provided and no bikes allowed inside? How are people supposed to get around? People need transportation but that doesn’t occur to this out of touch man. 
5. They refused to put door numbers on the doors so when a neighbour was found passed out in the hallway, the paramedics had no idea what apartment was his so they couldn’t carry him home and care for him there. It was embarrassing 
6. No animals allowed (except for the pigeons in the walls, the mice, and the cockroaches).
7. The only time we saw him was on rent pick up day or when he left mean notes of tenant doors.  
8. PAPER THIN WALLS
9. You cannot get your own internet source wired in so you have to use their really terrible wi-fi.
10. GREEDY!! The tiniest apartments (60m2 approx), its barely more than a closet for nearly $*****/month
11. SUPER GREEDY!! At the end of our time there, they were not going to include heating in the rent anymore… although you couldn’t control your heat or air conditioning independently anyway. We left before they start charging EXTRA for heat. 

Overall, we felt so disgusted by the way Nick treats human beings. Rent is clearly his cash cow and he has no consideration for the lives of those he is taking advantage of. There is a special place in **** for sociopathic leaches on society like him."
469,TONY BANHAM,OTTAWA,"He never fixed two leaking spots in the ceiling, and all tenants had to essentially annoy him into spraying the units for roaches, which never went away. He also banned pets and raised the rent each year above the provincial limit, which we were unaware of. He also raised the rent another $***** in time for whoever would be renting next."
470,R.PAUL MARTIN CONTRUCTION,KINGSTON,Absolute joke of a land lord. Passed it to his son who is only in it for the money. Nothing ever gets fixed anymore and the superintendents make life a living ****. I don’t leave my apartment anymore without the fear of being watched.
471,AMELIA PROPERTIES LAKEVIEW TOWERS TORONTO,TORONTO,"The property owners are reliable

Diverse tenants which is fantastic ! 
Animals and child friendly"
472,REALSTAR,TORONTO,"Building is poorly maintained- roach problems (super will ONLY treat common areas, and the only common area is the laundry room, we had to treat our unit out of pocket), grimy, lighting in lobby burns out regularly and takes them weeks to replace, ongoing plumbing issues, blocked up air vents that have never been maintained, defective smoke detectors that go off constantly for no reason are a common issue shared by multiple tenants. Building has problems with vandalism, theft, and break ins, super refuses to install cameras or do anything to resolve concerns. Super ignores tenants and won't answer if you knock at their door and can hear they are on the other side. The only time you hear from them at all is when they are giving you the bare minimum legal notice for entry to your unit, they don't care about giving you enough notice to get time off work."
473,NAVENKA KANALEC,TORONTO,"Nancy is the best landlord I've ever had. She genuinely cares for the tenants and her building. Always available and friendly, prompt with any issues/requests for repairs. Couldn't wish for a better landlord."
474,REBECCA AND ANDREJAS ALLGEIER,SCARBOROUGH,"Recorded every conversation we had, without my knowledge, which may be legal but is ultra sleazy. Had to beg for lighting along side and back of house (the path taken to get to the entrance). They purchased but I had to install!***** Landlord failed to mention that their playroom is directly above the bedroom, also stated that the boys do not run back and forth and act unruly inside - flatly untrue.
They were disrespectful in regard to my quiet enjoyment of the unit. As a tenant, I went above and beyond: doing repairs, purchasing items (TP holder in bathroom, PT holder in kitchen, upgraded outlets in kitchen, I even did a full cabinet refacing, LED lighting and backsplash reno at no charge (they paid for materials but the kitchen was in awful condition!) I also left them a nice loveseat yet I was evicted anyway! Here I am today waiting my turn in a video hearing with the LTB (Landlord Tenant Board) because they feel I don't deserve a rental abatement. Accusing me of causing damage to their unit, meanwhile I did a free reno (I'm a carpenter). Accused me of not cleaning (the place was spotless other than some dust bunnies on moving day, in fact it was left in far better condition than when I moved in.
Just takers, and mistrustful. Who insists on face to face discussions only so they can record without the other party's knowledge?"
475,KW PROPERTY,CAMBRIDGE,They make “don’t do the repairs without permission from the landlords” which apparently can take months to approve. They also go into your apartment without notice and that made me uncomfortable. Oh and let’s not forget that they tried to charge us for failure to allow access for a routine fire inspection when no one came to the apartment on either day they said they would be there to do it.
476,GULBURG INC.,TORONTO,"Landlord asked for two months of rent deposit and never sent the contract until the move-in date. When we finally received the contract it was $***** more than the agreed upon rent.  He made it impossible for us to do a lease transfer as well. To make things worse, the apartment was handed over to us as a total mess: holes in the wall everywhere, peeling paint, parts of the ceiling falling off, no doors on the wardrobe because they had been broken and never fixed. Pictures of the apartment posted on website were wildly different than reality and incredibly misleading. Rent was $***** for***** He also resorted to sexist comments when confronted about his unethical behaviour."
477,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Horribly managed, rude and ignorant management.  Roaches, bedbugs and rats run the two buildings because garbage is everywhere.  They are more interested in attracting new renters than looking after the ones already living in their slummy buildings.  In a nutshell, an awful experience."
478,BOBBY SAFI,OTTAWA,"I feel the landlord and his brother did not properly address pest issues including mice in a timely or reasonable manner. Eventually they resorted to poison traps which left dead mice around in a household with pets. Further, rent increases were sometimes a bit above the legal guidelines in Ontario without justification. Generally I felt they did not communication well and were not very involved. However, rent was fairly cheap and there weren’t many other issues."
479,NORTH44 PROPERTIES - DONLANDS,TORONTO,"I loved my apartment on Donlands. Upon moving in, everything was freshly painted and maintained. I never had an issue with communication, and when I wanted to leave the apartment before my lease was up, the sublease arrangement was quick and efficient. I would rent from them again."
480,YANN FLEURY,NORTH BAY,Been with this landlord for years and  is very responsive and willing to help out with issues immediately. Great deal of respect for him.
481,"LIZHEN ZHENG (HAYLEY, HEBY)",TORONTO,This landlord does not understand the fundamental responsibility of maintaining a rental property. They refuse to repair or replace appliances and will only do maintenance when forced to by city bylaw officers. They also refuse to provide proper written notice before entering a rental property and will harass tenants when they ask to have repairs done.
482,DIVYA IYER & PRASHANT V,TORONTO,"Divya and Prashant were so sweet - they clearly love this unit. They were reasonable with pricing, incredibly responsive when it came to any needs we had with the condo, and were very flexible. We had no issues in the year we lived here."

485,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"Since Akelius bought the building, we are all living in a constant construction zone for the past*****  Cosmetic repairs are made to try and justify above guideline increases.  We have had an above guideline increase every year.  The building manager is friendly although the work done in the units are shoddy at best and slow.  A garbage bag was taped over a hole in my bathroom wall for weeks!  Notice to enter units are vague around when time of entry will be.  That said, the building manger does accompany people that do inspections in each unit (i.e. annual fire alarm testing).  Considering the number of properties they own internationally, don't be surprised their actions are driven by high profit returns before creating conditions which allow people to have safe, comfortable, affordable housing."
486,EMPTY,OAKVILLE,Never felt respected when I lived there
487,TA PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"Most things done by the book, but also can be a bit shady at times. Tom has no humanity, just cares about money."
488,PINEDALE PROPERTY,ETOBICOKE,"I have lived here on Bergamot Ave for over***** When we moved in the apartment was clean and we didn't have any issues. The superintendent at the time had just been replaced and the new one did a great job. He eventually moved on with his family. Since then the building and surrounding property has gone downhill. We have gone through***** cleaners!! A new couple just started here less than a month ago and so far they seem pretty good. The management however is terrible and probably the reason we run through Supers and cleaners so often. Repairs are done based on whether they like you.

I notified the management***** My counters in the kitchen were replaced as well as the sinks but they were put on top of old worn out cupboards. It looks horrible! This management office has a manager who is racist and does not try to hide it. She makes comments about anyone who is not of Latin background like her. She talks very badly to and about black tenants especially!!! Pinedale has the potential to be a good place to live because the units are spacious but they need to be upgraded. Only upgrades are done when a tenant moves out. They renovate the unit and upgrade the kitchen, bathroom and floors so they can hike up the rent to unreasonable prices!***** parking!!! Bringing a***** month!.***** When will our government do something about this rent gouging???? When will scum lords be held accountable??"
489,GRANGE TOWERS,TORONTO,"Overall a good building, but receptionist (from property manager) can be a bit rude an sarcastic. Lots of package theft. Necessary repairs are usually completed on time. Have seen cockroaches but pest control is swiftly called. Generally clean. It is an old and dated building."
490,RAN WEI,OAKVILLE,"As far as landlords go, Ran is pretty fantastic. He's extremely responsive as we reach him via text and whenever repairs are needed, he usually sends someone within the next day or two. Our oven stopped working and we got a new one the next day. He gives proper notice when he's planning to enter the house, however sometimes he does just show up at the door to mention he's mowing the lawn or something. The rent hasn't increased too significantly in the past year, although it is pretty expensive already. He's a fair guy though. My perspective may be different from the people living in the basement level of our unit."

I went to the LTB as well. Now we have another N12 and more lies on paper from them Stay away from these landlords and away from her. These people should not be landlords. They are also rude and ignorant with everyone and hang up the phone on tenants. No respect for us at all but they sure want their money! This has been a sick nightmare!"
493,FLEURY PROPERTY,NORTH BAY,"I've being  renting with them for over*****  In the past few years they where able to move me around since my family sized changed and needed to upgrade.

But has no problem maximizing the yearly increase with barely maintaining the actual property. In our lease snow maintenance is included, it has been done a total of once in the two years we’ve lived on the property."
496,SHIPLAKE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Honestly about as good as they come. They have multiple properties, so can't speak for all of them, but management is fair, reasonable and seems to just want to run the property by the book with minimal headache for them or for the tenant. Repairs are prompt, staff is friendly. They have events and contest for residents, which is cool if you're into that. I have had problems with individuals within the company, but it's pretty minor. One desk guy is a bit unhelpful, some leasing staff is a bit, used car sales shall we say, pretty minor. 

Overall, can't really go wrong with Shiplake."

503,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,"Building intercom is often not working. Remote concierge service is incompetent. Mail is often stolen from a designated ""secure"" mail room. Underground fob entry parking lot is frequently raided by thieves breaking into multiple vehicles. Management is in collaboration with targetpark who issue illegal pink parking infraction notices for cars in visitor parking. Air conditioning systems are caked with years of dust. Management does not care about the wellbeing of tenants, to that effect, after a tenant has been harassed and physically assaulted management fails to provide video footage to authorities in a timely manner. Parking lot has flooded indicating drains being clogged. Ac drain hoses from units above drip onto patio of units below causing mold buildup on the wall. Building often experiences isolated power outages (the rest of the area has power). Parking garage door has become stuck several times trapping a lineup of cars within the underground lot. Hallway garbage disposals are bio-hazards, they have never been cleaned."
504,ANDREW CIGNA / NFPA,LONDON,"Andrew bought our house (6 room rental) during the pandemic so he could flip it. 


He did no repairs or cleaning; there was a room that was disgusting because a previous tenant locked her cat in for weeks. You could smell cat litter through the vents. He promised to the eventual buyer he would clean this room and do some other maitenence - he never did.


There was a bad situation with one of our roommates getting agressive when he drank alchohol. The environment was unsafe, he was often exposed and urinating off the back porch,  he would threaten any male tenants, but nothing could be done because when I told Andrew about it,  as it was a ""he said, she said"" situation.  One night this roommate confronted us and threatened us, we were able to get recordings of this incident to show proof to Andrew how uncomfortable and unsafe this living arrangement was and nothing was done.  When the topic of eviction came up, i was told to consider this tenant's mental health and ultimatly the problem tenant was allowed to continue on with his behaviour.


When our house was finally sold to the next landlord, Andrew fibbed and said the landlord's two sons were moving in (even tho it was the landlord himself and one son). I do not think this was miscommunication between the landlord and Andrew because the landlord was surprised nobody knew he was moving in.


 Andrew said he was meant to ""streamline"" interactions between tenant and landlord, but when i had issues with this landlord, Andrew replied  ""Deal with him."" before sending a (much more nicer) worded email to everyone saying he was no longer involved.


If you are looking to rent,sell or buy i would avoid anything that has Andrew Cigna's name attached to it. Ontop of my experience, the landlord that bought the house from Andrew was dissatisfied with the condition it was in vs. what was promised.  This seems to be a consistent trait as Andrew will just say whatever people want to hear with no follow-through."
505,SENTRY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NIAGARA,"Overall, definitely not the WORST but not the best either. 
I lived in the main floor of a Semi, there were tenants in the basement as well. 
I lived there for***** myself/my roommate was awful. 
We had no screens on the windows so we could never open them. We asked several times over***** ""being looked into"". 
There was minimal regular maintenance to the property itself. The front door area (inside and out) along with the shared entrance was constantly COVERED in spider webs, huge spiders and other bugs. The ceiling in the shared entrance was probably about***** wasn't feasible for us to clean it or gain any sort of safe access to all the bugs. 
The property management company came there minimum once a month to collect the change out of our washer and dryer, so they knew that was there. 
They also saw the DISGUSTING state the downstairs tenant left the laundry room consistently over the***** 
I cleaned it myself a few times when I couldn't stand it anymore, which was repulsive and not my job. 
We ended up getting mice, which thankfully they did handle very well. Exterminators were sent a few days later and came back to check a couple of times. 
The stated when we moved in they had professional cleaners clean the place, that was definitely a lie. 
There was also damage to the walls that should have been painted over prior to us moving in, but it wasn't. 
When I moved out - I asked for my pet deposit (which I learned was illegal to ask for) back several times via text and email with zero response. Not even a ""we are looking into it"" or ""we will talk to the landlords and get back to you"". Finally a month after I vacated the property and sent them an email stating I would be contacting the landlord and tenant board, I received an etransfer for my pet deposit. 
Just all stuff to be aware folks."
506,TODD AND LYNN GUERGIS,BARRIE,"Not the worst landlords, but very slow to make a repair and also threatened to pass on charges for utilities for having had the audacity to use the dryer during the day a single time (our utilities were included in rent).  We also had no control over the thermostat in our unit and in the winter, we had some nights were the temperature inside the home dropped to less than*****"
507,SMK HOLDINGS,GANANOQUE,Excellent landlords. Very unobtrusive. Reasonable rent.
508,KYLE AND MAY LAMOTHE,TORONTO,They own***** They will N12 you. These rich and unethical people are a perfect example of why vacancy control is necessary.
509,RASHDA RANA AND UMAIR SHERIFF,BURLINGTON,"Rashda Rana and Umair Sheriff are aspiring slumlords. I rented a property from them in Burlington, which was a mistake from the start. These people don't seem too concerned with meeting their obligations as landlords. The unit was bug infested, had broken appliances, the heat didn't work correctly, and they were not responsive to any issues. The fridge broke and was not replaced for***** The landlord said nothing but eventually did replace the fridge. They took up to a week to even acknowledged reports of something broken, and then 2-3 months before they might look at it. Their claim was that ""only safety matters are our responsibility."" 

Absolutely can't say anything positive about them."
510,SPICE CART,TORONTO,"Spice Cart have to be the most useless people in the city. We are a complex that never gets snow removal, our garbage area is infested with rats. Parking lot is joke, yet we get a letter asking us to park within the lines while there are NO visible lines, they haven’t been painted in over a decade. We have turf for grass that isn’t properly installed so it blows around and is hazardous. Wood fencing that looks like it was put together by preschoolers. We had a pipe leaking in a wall, the plumber came by to fix it (after we called the landlord who never return emails or phone call) plumber said they had dry walled over the water pipe to turn on and off so they had to shut the entire complexes water off. 
We had a flood two years ago in a huge rain and the landlord fought back on trying to fix any of the damage, to this day, there is probably mold now in the walls and they won’t check it. Had fire alarms installed***** No screens on the windows, so bugs get in. Infested with ants, mice every winter. 
OMG, I could write for an hour on how useless these people are. 
Increased everyone’s rent last week with Zero notice to tenants. 
When new people move in they charge you for the water heater that they are suppose to pay for and it takes months for water and hydro to take it off your bill the entire time Spice Cart says they know nothing about this mistake. 
Sevon or whatever the Super intendants name is (I say that because he NEVER comes around, ever) is more useless than a screen door in a submarine. Incompetent. Clueless. Pointless. Serves No purpose at all accept to come by once a winter and spread buckets and buckets of ice everywhere so when the snow melts he doesn’t have to pay a contractor to shovel, but that causes more issues. Heaven forbid something breaks, you need to send a ticket to get it fixed online. They then erase it and say they never Received it. We take screen shots of the emails before we send them you useless ****. Slumlords"
511,MEDALLION,TORONTO,"Medallion have been consistently horrible to deal with. The building super is super nice and reliable but the Medallion office will not even return your calls or emails, even at times when they have incorrectly issued eviction notices to people in the building. The building has had hallway repairs ongoing for the past***** There has been*****"
512,GRAHAM HAWKINS,PETERBOROUGH,"Honestly, a pretty stand-up guy. Reasonable and fair."
513,CAPREIT,LONDON,Just a simple greedy corporation. They won't respond to your emails unless they want money from you. If you need a repair they don't care. If you have a problem they don't care. They stop pest control to save money. Barely plow in the winter for the same reason. Just a bad company that will treat you like dirt.
514,VIC RAJPUT,LONDON,"Vic bought our house (6 bedroom rental) from a company that breifly held ownership in *****. 

The company told us his two sons were moving in to the units in the basement, but in reality it was Vic himself moving in, and then later his son for the school year. 

While Vic did a lot of  much-needed repair and cleaning in the house, his approaches were invasive and rude. If you worked the day he was going through a  room to clean, he would not give you notification - meaning there was risk to having  your things (shoes, dvds,etc.) Being thrown out.

Vic has little regard for Tenant's boundries and space. He would use the tenants' things even though the agreed rule was we used our own things, and he would argue with you about it.

He would not give you proper***** 

He would impose rules, such as never allowed to do laundry at night, even though it was never a problem for anyone during the years i lived there.

Often Vic would hover or watch his tenants as they made food in the kitchen, making it uncomfortable to cook or clean. 

There is a tenant who may still live at this location; they have plenty of complaints, a drinking problem and as a result they create an unsafe evironment, however Vic has taken no notice or action despite knowing this occurs. 

Vic also has no awareness for those with ""disabilities"", and would berate my other roommate for cleaning despite the fact this roomate had a visual impairment to consider.

Although the location may be better now, i would advise against living there because you may run the risk of dealing with Vic if he still living there or decides to check in on his son."
515,AARON SHAUGHNESSY / 1850480 ONTARIO LTD,PEMBROKE,"I have had a lot of landlords over the year and Aaron is one of the best. Whenever we have an issue with the unit he comes and fixes it.

He takes to to always ask us “ is there anything else in the unit that needs fixing?”

I hope to rent from him for a long time."
516,KRIS CLIPSHAM,OTTAWA,Pretty hands on landlord and straightforward so you know what you are getting into.  Is quick to respond to maintenance issues.  Does add a non-standard clause to shovel own snow but no big deal as rest of rental is smoothly run.
517,ADENA HOLDINGS INC,WOODSTOCK,"I’ve rented here for multiple years and the company and on-site Superintendents are always respectful and follow the rules of LTB. Our building doesn’t have much turnover because we all love it here. This building is known as the quietest in the city. It’s not a building for parties but instead a nice wholesome family oriented building. It’s one of the few buildings left that allow us to have pets but that comes with being respectful of your neighbours and not allowing them to bark. Tenants that don’t take responsibility for keeping their dog quiet is a selfish disrespectful person and could make it a no pet policy building. Thankfully our superintendents assist in keeping it quiet. Our superintendents aren’t your babysitter. They work hard to keep our building clean, snow shovelled, grass cut, lights changed, painting apts, respectful and kind towards us. if you love peace, quiet, clean building with repairs being done in timely manner and modern upgrades being completed periodically, then this is the perfect building to live and raise your children. If NOT then give your notice and MOVE!!! You’re not being stopped!!!  None of us want the previous person’s negativity, and incorrect opinions here and none of us agree with your comments. It’s mostly a smoke free building except for long time tenants that still smoke. There’s no earwigs in my place but welcome to reality and getting the odd bug like spider in your place that happens no matter where you live. I’m thankful we don’t have cockroaches. No building has to provide ANY visitor parking. Them giving us a few spots you should be grateful and at least now when I come home from work, I know I’m going to have a parking spot, unlike before where everyone was parking everywhere. Get your head out of the sand, you don’t realize how great it is living here. I’m never moving!!!!! but you can."
518,2414850 ONTARIO INC.,NORTH BAY,"Best landlord I have ever had. I’ve never actually met the landlord, but the super who runs the building and has stakes in the company is the best. I’ve been here for***** If I have ever had a problem it has always been fixed within***** They are big on your apartment feeling like home. A lot of long term tenants in the building. If you are a good tenant and are respectful they will always work with you. Pets are allowed, you can paint if you feel the need. The super goes above and beyond. Building is always extremely clean."
519,Y&Y PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,They were fine. I appreciated that the building manager was companionate and took action when things were brought up.
520,JAMES STREZOS,TORONTO,"Was quick to respond to maintenance issues, especially HVAC-related. Pretty straightforward rental, worked entirely through realtor for initial paperwork which kept things smooth. Does add a non-standard clause to shovel own snow but no big deal as rest of rental was perfectly pleasant."
521,METCAP LIVING,ETOBICOKE,"To start of the review, The property Management should be read METCRAP!  Thrilled to see such a platform! -- as landlords require all information from the tenant - to base their decision to rent to an applicant.  We need to reverse the roles and have landlord prove their worthiness to rent to the applicant.  If we could have that done before we moved into METCAP - We wouldn't have rented from them.   Looking now on the internet we see that METCRAP has very bad and illegal reviews across Canada.   Starting with their no interest in fixing up buildings they purchase -- letting them go to Slumlord conditions.  Elevators that don't work.  Paint peeling - balconies crumbling - Front entrance crumbling foundation and dirty windows from over a year ago. ( no one cleans). Mgmt is rude- no cares of safety of tenants-  Hands over the keys to strangers as they do not want to stay with contractor to watch over tenants belongs and or gives all keys ( to the bldg and rentals for the day( to easy to the contractor to make copies) and to boot when you move in- they do not change the locks or kicked in door.  This company will issue notices of entry at least every*****  ( for one reason or another but actually does nothing) They do not respect your peace and enjoyment of the rental. Even if you new -- paying over $***** for a***** -- it may have lipstick updates - new kitchen and bathroom -- but comes with ants, cockroaches and even bedbugs. Tenants in the building are constantly angry and not happy overall since METCrap took over.  Over building is in disrepair and or at least invest some money and paint the place and replace the *****'s square piece carpets. Snow removal is a joke- as they come by***** The review is DO NOT RENT from Metcap - unless you like to be miserable."
522,COMPTEN MANAGEMENT,ETOBICOKE,"Overall the group of 5 apartments are in decent shape and upkeep. Most things are taken care of quickly, though the ************ team on site can be a little tough to deal with when needed. Maintenance requests are acted on in a timely manner, and normal resolve the issue adequately."
523,SOUTHLANDS VILLAGE,WAINFLEET,"The manager of this year round mobile home park is a ********, a liar and a ******** has many fines from the ******** for issues in regards to our septic system and water system."
524,WOODGREEN COMMUNITY SERVICES,TORONTO,"Woodgreen does repair things in a timely manner, their employees are extremely rude and withhold information from tenants, they lets other tenants disturb people, they don’t respond to complaints, let pests multiply in their properties and don’t care."
525,JAG NARAIN,WELLAND,"This landlord doesn't fix anything, ********. Over average rent adjustments, loves renting to ********."
526,22 TINDER INC,NORTH YORK,"This building is rarely clean, and good luck finding the ***************."
527,22 TINDER INC,NORTH YORK,"Building filthy all the time. Gross, dead rat on property for weeks super too scared to remove. Garbage left out back for months. Fire alarms not tested. Chase super to do repairs. Super too ******** to care. Building filthy all the time. Lawn not taken care of front of building looks rundown. They scam tenants to pay ********* increase when government said increase capped for the year and ********* not approved. Scam tenants for new locker fee exact year of rent freeze b/c of covid.  Landlord only cares about money and screw tenants living in building. If I could post photos of how gross and rundown building is I would. They want $2,300 for units so now multiple families living in 1 bedroom. Tenants needs to chase and chase to get work done but do make shift repairs to raise rent. Like living with rodents you'll like this building."
528,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,LONDON,"These guys are useless. There's a ********** infestation in the walls that spills into people's suites no matter what you do, and there have been intermittent problems with ants and mice (which the building fails to respond to when reported). Repair requests take forever to be filled. The people they bring in for maintenance/exterminator/inspection are routinely **********, lazy, and disrespectful, and openly use any visit to your suite as an excuse to snoop for lease violations (real or imagined). Electricity and water are often cut off for hours at a time with minimal warning. Inspectors arrive in the middle of the day and interrupt work meetings and other telework stuff, and act like it's ******** when you tell them to come back later. In general, everyone is rude and dismissive - they know their job is to leech from you and they act like it. Never live here if you can help it."
529,VISION PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BRANTFORD,"Beyond the best landlords I have ever had! They are always on time if I need repairs. Respectful, caring and trusting!"
530,CHRIS FERNANDO,OWEN SOUND,"Chris checked our mail box, he entered our apartment without knocking, or notice. He wouldn't allow us to open our windows. His pest control efforts were a minimum, rodents were regularly an issue. He did respond to requests for repairs, however the repairs weren't done well and left the apartment looking *********. He was rude to our guests and us. There was no lease and he was careless with our paperwork."
531,BOOTA SINGH,BRAMPTON,Always ready to fight with tenants with no reason. I do not recommend to rent a room in his house. Always do scoldings and say bad words to the tenants. Really disappointed with the very first room rent in Canada.
532,SARVJIT SINGH,BRAMPTON,"Am here from jully2022 ,every thing is v good respectful neighbors and onwer also very friendly"
533,JACOB JEBAILEY,TORONTO,"Very courteous. Repairs done immediately (plumbing exploded in basement, plumber was there the same day). Rent increased in line with provincial guidelines. Actively investigated and mediated difficulties with ********* tenants in 2nd floor apartment.
Only issue was we really did feel like we were renting his house, that it was never our home, but overall would recommend."
534,JEREMY FINE,TORONTO,"I rented from this guy for about 8 months through a sublease. He treated me like a second class citizen because I was a subletter (even though he has his property set up as a rooming house and constantly has subletters). This is because I asked him to do pest control since we had roaches. He told me to go to home depot and buy chemicals myself! Heated email exchange and he threatened to have me evicted because he was mad I told him to ************ or else I'd call the city. I also work in property management, so I am educated about tenant rights. This guy acts like because he owns property that he is above the laws governing landlords and doesn't have to treat anyone with respect. Stay far away!"
535,MORGUARD CORPORATION (LEASIDE),TORONRO,"Stay away. Morguard are ********. The scary electrical fires due to old electrical panels was managed soooo poorly. Often only one elevator working for hundreds of people. One elevator has been out of service since May. Cockroaches and ants are a constant battle. There was construction fencing erected around the building over a year ago with no explanation and no work has been done. The pool has been out of order for months as well. The building is dirty. There is mold on the vents and their answer is to paint over it. Management does not care and is honestly under qualified. 

While I’m here, let’s add some more problematic things about the building:

The laundry room is filthy and more than half of the machines are always out of service. There was toxic ******** that leaked onto the windshield of my car from the ceiling in the garage. It etched a pattern into my windshield I was never able to get rid of. I once got stuck in an elevator for over 2 hours with no cell reception and virtually no communication on what was being done to free me. Many times I’ve taken the day off work and lost pay so that contractors could enter my unit only to have no one show up. The water, hydro, air conditioning and elevators are always being shut down for the entire l day due to “maintenance.” The hallways smell. The carpets are stained. My sink drain has to be snaked often and still gets clogged and emits foul smelling noxious gas. There are sometimes large chunks of rust in my water. The trash chute rooms stink and are infested with fruit flies.

******** is a huge corporation that makes money by exploiting peoples essential need for lodging."

537,ANDREW MCGRATH,TORONTO,"Andrew was a great landlord. I have since moved out of the house but i wanted to provide a positive review because the experience with him stood out from every other landlord interaction I've ever had. Starting with the application process where he shared information about the house and how it was renovated, and the expectations he set, to the experience living at the house and his responsiveness in dealing with any issue big or small. We since bought our own place and I now appreciate how much work it is being an owner, I'm so grateful to have had a landlord like Andrew. While Andrew did increase the rent by the maximum allowed each year, he also set this expectation with us before signing the lease that this would be standard practice during our tenancy."
538,MR.WONG 56 CARTMEL DR.,MARKHAM,The landlord demanded a 30% rent increase and threatened to evict me if I didn't agree. 
539,LYNNE LIGHTFOOTE,PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY,"The tenancy offer was inclusive of ********* and *********.  The place was heated by oil furnace, but throughout the winter, the oil tank was topped up by the jug, and it was always a waiting game.  The tank needs to topped up every few days in the winter.   Response was never immediate.  ********* was disconnected, even though I paid it separately.  The workers from ********* ********* advised that she had a history of being disconnected.  Nothing was ever done to prevent mice from entering the premises.
When I let her know the response time to have the furnace back on was not acting in good faith, my truck was found in the driveway with $4000 damage caused by a snow plough."
540,NAN PANTHIA,TORONTO (REXDALE),"Nan owns many properties around the Humber College area. All I have frequented were run down and had problems with ********** living in the house. It took Nan several weeks to address the situation.

In the basement of the house I lived in, a man threatened tenants and proceeded to stab one of his roommates, he was allowed to continue living there.

Cleaners were promised at move in however none were present. No keys were presented until 2 weeks into tenancy. Entire house had 12 people living in it through 3 floors."
541,GYKAN ENTERPRISES,TORONTO,"One of the worst landlords I ever had, they paid their mortgage off by housing artists in light industrial studio spaces as live in tenants, as soon as it was paid off and they put the building on the market for sale, the harassment, abuse and renovictions began
they even managed to evict the few who had residential status by putting so much pressure in them until they simply gave up
this landlord also treats his employees unfairly, one janitor committed suicide after being illegally fired after he had cancer surgery and became destitute as a result
heating is always turned on one month late and turned off one month early, complaints to the city are useless since the landlord manages to manipulate the inspectors by taking them to court and having charges dismissed
last but nat least,during my last year there I became aware that the building keeps failing environmental safety tests due to ********* and no one seems to be able to figure out why or how to remedy this situation 
this used to be a colgate factory that was purchased by the Jain family in the 70‘s and converted for mixed use tenancies since; to this day there are illegal residential tenants in the building who pay insane commercial rates while all those with residential status(and rent control) have been evicted over the recent years"
542,ROY MANAGEMENT SERVICES/DUPUIS PROPERTIES,NORTH BAY,"So many bad things to say about Roy Management and Dupuis (Dupuis transitioned to Roy sometime we were living here, not clear). Once, a sewage pipe broke and flooded our basement with human excrement. We live on the top floor of the house and we could smell it for days but no tenants have access to the basement. Our neighbours had to threaten legal action for them to even come clean it. When they did, they dumped the human waste in our yard. On our neighbours garden. They never fix anything, threaten to evict you because they “lost” your payment and then you have to fight them and show proof that you did in fact pay it. They let random people come in during showings to sell the property without a representative. I felt very unsafe in my own home. They came in when we had Covid despite me asking them to not enter as we had Covid. And so many more things."
543,ANAST HOLDINGS,LONDON,"Decent landlord if we stayed quiet and never asked for repairs or had issues - if we did, it was like pulling teeth. Landlord was not overbearing or infringing on our space- quite the opposite. Landlord did absolute bare minimum to care for their property or issues in unit. 

We had multiple floods while living there, nothing was ever aired out properly (in ceilings, walls etc.

Extensive black mould, we were told it was ""road dust"", but could visibly see the shape of the deck boards above our living room ceiling. Walls were squishy in corners from water buildup, Landlord did no repairs aside from a fresh coat of paint when we vacated. We only vacated due to mould and being told it was ********* and we were high conflict for wanting the issue taken seriously. Very bad ending to an overall ""okay-ish"" experience. Again, was only okay-ish because Landlord was non-existant. Overall experience, cleanliness and care for properly, management and being treated respectfully - big 1/10. Will never recommend. Do not rent unless you have no standards of living and want to wake up with bloody noses and heavy chests from the abundance of mould he's been painting over for years."
544,CARLOS PINHEIRO,TORONTO,"I was a quiet tenant who had never missed a day of rent. Carlos wanted to ********* me and raise rent *********. Came to my door and started grabbing my things and taking them out of my apartment to try and throw me out. Too scary to stay, so I moved. The day of the move it snowed, and Carlos showed up and mocked me for having to move in the snow, saying ""it's such a ********* to have to move."""
545,ACCOMOD8 U,WATERLOO,"Do not live in their Lester building! I lived on the top floor and by the time we moved out (after only 4 months!!) There were 6 leaks in the ceiling to the point where you couldn't cook if it was raining because you would get plaster in your food. Landlord never responded to any of my emails and the people before me had been trying for a ******** to get the issue addressed with no luck. The bathrooms had bugs and water pressure in the shower was minimal. For laundry there is only 1 set of washer/dryers per 2 FLOORS of 4-5 bedroom apartments. But don't bother using them, because when my roommate tried to use the dryer it started ********!"
546,DOMINIC TENUTA,MISSISSAUGA,******** was a great landlord. Always respectful and responsive. He was fair and cared to properly maintain the property.
547,JASBIR LAMBA,WATERLOO,"Jasbir attempted to raise the rent by $300 while the pandemic rent freeze was in effect. She also installed a lock box on the thermostat which meant she could prevent us from changing the HVAC at any time. She is a greedy woman, do not trust her. Get everything in writing. She failed to provide a rent receipt when asked."
548,M. SCHIKETANZ REAL ESTATE,WATERLOO,Pretty good overall experience. Been living in the Hickory Apartments since Dec 2020 and have had no major issues. Maintenance is generally done quickly and the building is always clean. They are poor at handling tenant disputes but that doesn't come up too often.
549,PROPER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"Terry keeps his properties in appallingly bad condition. Quick cheap fixes over solid repairs every time, leading to issues like mold and frequent loss of heat and water. He also refused to install proper egress windows in our basement apartment. He requires ********* (ONLY names are permitted) and refuses to pay interest on last month's rent (also illegal). He's a stubborn and difficult man to say the least."
550,LIVEWELL PROPERTY,HAMILTON,"ATTENTION HAMILTON ONTARIO: Do NOT rent from Live Well Property Management/Mary Flynn

- Rented out Unit May 16th 2020, stayed a total of 1.5 hours. I am not one to complain and am an easy-going person who has never had issues with landlords in the past. 

- This Landlord is Purposely renting out properties with BedBugs and not telling potential tenants. Within an hour of me moving in they were crawling out of the walls. They did not treat effectively, Tried to intimidate me into staying, and after realizing I refused to stay they harassed me to get my belongings out before they were even finished treatment. 

- they were caught Purposely lying to potential tenants- had a friend call and ask if I had pets because he has severe asthma and dander would be extremely detrimental to his health and she said NO. Asked why I was moving out and she said “my job fell through” 

- Putting up an ad saying the apartment was available now, when it had not even been treated yet, and my belongings were still in there. This is when she tried to harjass me to get my belongings out before treatment was finished. 

- Charged me an extra 45$ for a parking spot that turned out to maybe not exist and told me to just park in municipal lot 

- Wouldn’t let me walk down fire escape during viewing to check out the safety of it - turns out it was rickety and poorly made. Didn’t find that out until trying to use it to move my belongings in. 

- these are just some of the many unfortunate things I have had to endure in the past two weeks thanks to these  *********. I am personally out almost 2000$ between hotel stays, storage fees, gas money and replacement items - and these costs are constantly increasing with each day. For clarification- I did receive my first and last back after constantly calling and demanding compensation. However, I did not receive any compensation for financial hardships (those listed above) and mental anguish I have endured. 

this situation has taken on my mental health - especially considering this all happened during a literal pandemic."
551,SHELDON RAKOWSKY,TORONTO,"Sheldon Rakowsky and his agent ********* didn't respect privacy, Garry Harrison broke in a total of 9 times without notice or permission to enter. Sheldon and Garry had also violated my personal information by using my emergency contacts to ********* my mother everyday for a week. They have also ********* the security of the building everyday to ask for information about me instead of getting in contact with me through my emails which he had to contact me along with my number. Building securities supervisor was also there when Garry Harrison broke in back in August of last year and nothing was done to address that breach of privacy and rights. Should have known rights would be violated from the beginning when Sheldon Rakowsky asked for 6 months rent up front on a Draft of a total of 11,900.00 and the next 6 months on post dated cheques. After the first year, rent was covered on post dated cheques and he didn't give me a new rental agreement for the next years and it got in the way of government documentation by making it difficult to get IDs renewed with the address and student information verified. Sheldon Rakowsky has also evicted me without warning or notice and there was nothing I could do about it, they only gave me 3 days to get my belongings and I was to get in touch with Garry Harrison to get access to my stuff within those 3 days. I tried to get in contact and was ignored, the next day Garry Harrison got back to me to tell me within the last 3 days my belongings were removed because I missed the window to get them. Sheldon was kind enough to store them in a garbage but he didn't pack all of my belongings, my furniture and small appliances that I bought were kept by Sheldon Rakowsky. So was some of my other things such as expensive perfume, balcony furniture, bumbells, barbells and kettlebell."
552,DOMUS INC,KITCHENER,"I live in a regular apartment (not student housing) that is run by Domus Inc. It seems that the experiences of people who live in their student housing are very different, so this review should only be considered for their non-student housing.

Repair, Health/Safety, Stability and Tenant Privacy Ratings: I would describe them as a very ""hands off"" style of landlord. They do not interfere with tenants and generally do not seem to care what happens on their property. They are responsive when complaints are made and their response time to building maintenance issues is generally adequate, especially for issues inside of tenants' units. The maintenance staff are also very kind and seem to genuinely care about the wellbeing of tenants. However, their repairs in shared areas (stairwells, laundry) or for more labour intensive issues are often band-aid solutions, and the shared areas are often unsanitary. The also run their laundry on an app based system but they do not provide an internet connection in the laundry area, forcing tenants to use their phone data if you want to use the in-building laundry.

Respect Ratings: While my experience living in a Domus building has been much better than my experiences with other landlords, I give Domus a very low rating for tenant respect because of their ******** and shady leasing practices. When you rent a unit, Domus will not actually show you the specific lease for that unit. Instead they will show you a ""standard lease"" which is a generalized lease that could apply to any of their units. Additionally, they put ******** clauses on their leases such as no pets, limited guests, and that you must pay by post-dated cheque or automatic deposit which is ******** to require of a tenant as per the RTA (aside from the payment options, they don't actually enforce any of these ******** clauses). If you are living with a partner or roommate, they also will not allow you to add the second person's name to your lease (I think this is because they use the standardized lease and are too lazy to change it for each unique tenant situation; your partner/roomie can still live with you, but they may be at a legal disadvantage due to their name not being on the lease). They also ask for an ******** key deposit (it is much higher than the actual cost of replacing their keys)."
553,JOEL AND DIANE CHAUVIN,WINDSOR,"Joel and Diane Chauvin are excellent landlords with the biggest hearts, they take care of my place and whenever I call they are right here to fix whatever is broken. Been a tenant with them for over 15 years and they treat us with respect and never bother us. Fire alarms, furnace filters Joel is on it every few months. "
554,LAURA SEGUIN,OTTAWA,"There's no laundry on sight and she just emails you constantly and doesn't leave you alone. She's interested in the dehumidifier in her basement, she's disrespectful when you go out of your way to help her. Don't reccomend living here, you would have much more privacy else where then with her living the floor above you."
555,MIRJA RAITA,RICHMOND HILL,"Had to respond here given the poor review I saw posted and to be completely honest, can’t trust it. It is a great place to live and the rent was more than reasonable for the neighbourhood. I enjoyed living in this triplex with other good tenants at the time. Good tenants make good landlords. I found the Landlord to be more than fair. Always easy to communicate with. Unit was always maintained. Landlord owns one property that I am aware of and intends to return in the future so was always very responsive to any concerns. I had a mutually respectful relationship with the landlord and found them to genuinely care about their property, their neighbours and the community. Keep up the good work. There is another side to that one post. Hope the unsatisfied tenants moved on without too much damage or disruption to everyone else. Great neighbourhood of people."
556,"BAY ST SUITES , - LANDLORD DAVE  -PROPERTY MANAGER AGAN",HAMILTON,"Let’s start with the repairs. There was a leak in the ceiling than over time (6 months) got bigger and grew where I had a hole that leaked all over my entertainment system and had to get rid of $300+ in equipment. , 
Then the musty Moldy carpet I offered ti replace,  also the mold alllll throughout the tiny , no stove, bar fridge kitchen attached to the bathroom by a doorway, no hall. 
The bathroom itself has mold, and smoke reside allll over the room. , you can’t shower without breathing it in.    Now for the rental stability and privacy ,  on numerous occasions the landlord has randomly showed up at my apartment door harassing me, and telling me word for word “if you don’t feel safe here than don’t open your doors” 
You don’t say that to a 19 year old in the middle of a building surrounded by drunks in an area with criminals. ,. ESPECIALLY if we have locked lobbies, and doors.  
The property manager is hard headed but reasonably respective of your space considering YOU are paying rent. The landlord Dave, is a whirlwind of a disastrous, high ego A hole , 
Even if you apologize, and start a new with him he manages to get by law, and the city involved for reasons they then laugh at him for."
557,ADAM HOFER / SARAH HOFER,STRATFORD,"Adam Hofer appears to be a wonderful warm landlord when you meet him. He owns a construction company, so you think he will keep your place in good repair. This is 100% not true. The building I lived in was infested with rats and I had numerous leaks through my ceiling from the tenants above, as well as the roof. I went without a bathroom ceiling for months that constantly poured water. I ended up having to get the city involved for minimal repairs.

Hia wife Sarah took over the landlord duties after that and she is one of the worst people I have ever met. She was disrespectful, she harassed us outside our apartment and made living in our little apartment actual Hell. I will never recommend them as landlords to anyone."
558,JONATHAN MEMMOTT,OTTAWA,Landlord entered bedrooms without notice or consent and screw nailed windows closed impeding air circulation and closing off fire exits. Stairs in home do not have proper railings and he rents out illegal bedrooms without fire escapes.
559,ALFRED STANISLAUS,TORONTO,"Does not follow any regulations. Will gossip about you to other tennants, is rude and also racist to people. Treats tradespeople like servants. Will constantly threaten to evict you if you don’t stay in his good side."
560,MINTO,OTTAWA,"Fire alarms in building were not adequately positioned so if the building fire alarms went off one could *barely* hear it in the bedrooms.

Repeated issues with carpenter ants in the walls of the building. Called consistently for the issue to be addressed which were promised would happen. It never did to the extent that they sprayed other apartments and forgot ours...twice.

My friend's Minto rental had bed bugs for months and it was never addressed to the point that they eventually gave up and moved out.

The laneway to a Minto house was so heaved it was a horrid safety hazard to walk up and down the stairs. My friend fell and nearly broke their ankle (was in a cast for months because of how bad the damage was) because of the uneven, hole riddled surface."
561,CONCERT PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"The leasing office staff are okay, some nice and some petty about the rule of law. They suddenly changed the rules about paying online for rent, requiring it 3-5 days before the end of the month instead of the 1st. My payment didn't land the Friday night because the bank was slow to process it, so they served me a late rent notice at 9:00 Monday despite the fact I sent evidence of the payment on the Friday. 

I've been complaining about smoke/weed smell coming into my unit for almost a year and when one staff person finally came up after 10 complaints to ""Concert On Call"", her story was ""it's probably the intake vent"" and that was the end of it. 

Overall, it's an okay company to rent from but nothing special to write home about."
562,JDN,LONDON,"Absolute scum of the earth slumlords who believe that their tenants just deserve to be unsafe. No compassion, no willingness to compromise. Mice and other pests abound. Don't expect anything to change unless somebody dies in their units, and even then I am not sure. Avoid at any cost, even if it's the cheapest."
563,JANIS ROBERTSON,OTTAWA,Nice ladybut the property was in absolute disrepair after her taking over. Decades old appliances is fine but she would say “I’ll come fix it” and never do anything or suddenly disappear. Lots of bug and mice issues especially when seasons changed. Laundry was so not maintained I’m surprised the lint stuck in the walls didn’t set on fire in the heat wave.
564,GLENN TURCOTTE,NORTH BAY,Landlord refuses to deal with repair issues and issues related to pest control. Allowed cockroach infestation to grow wildly out of control the rather than fumigate. He is also sexist and will only communicate directly with male tenants.
565,WESTDALE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,I’ve lived in the same unit for over 11 years and haven’t had any issues with majority of the westdale staff in the building. The main manager is often abrasive and rude but the rest of the staff do make up for it.
566,CCOC (CENTRETOWN CITIZENS OTTAWA CORPORATION),OTTAWA,"Landlord responds quickly to issues with the unit. However with any persistent issue, you get a different admin staff and maintenance worker dealing with it every time, and it seems there's never any history of the issue tracked - you have to repeat the whole story from the  beginning every time. Rent is cheap. Quality of units depends on the building. Adequate but could be better."
567,FOREST HILL KIPLING,MISSISSAUGA,"Their other properties are good, but the one in Mississauga is so crap that even their management isn’t capable of taking care of the premises. The townhouses at this property are so old and run-down that management are incapable of keeping up with how condemned the houses at the townhouse complex are becoming."
568,PINEDALE PROPERTIES,NORTH YORK,"I’ve had a few landlords in my time. I currently live at a rent-controlled Pinedale Properties apartment and have been here for over 10 years. I actually feel a little locked in because if I were to move elsewhere I likely couldn’t afford to stay in Toronto. 

Over the years my rent has increased only per the provincial guidelines. Repair problems have been handled fairly quickly. The place has air conditioning; they change the filters annually, and do regular fire alarm testing twice a year and come in and check to make sure each unit’s smoke alarm is working. 

I like it here and it helps that they chose and pretty cool building superintendent to look after things. I don’t feel disrespected when I have a complaint."
569,SHAWNA BLACK & MARIE-FRANCE ROBATAILLE,OTTAWA,"Not even a legal lease, and then we got illegally evicted. Disgusting place. Lovely if you want to smell cat shit and fermenting compost outside. No privacy. Listed as a private apartment but they will come down to do laundry whenever without warning. They’ll come in to your place without consent or warning when you’re not there too! And if you say no, you’ll be illegally evicted! 790 Claude."
570,LINDA ING GILBERT/FABIAN GILBERT,TORONTO,Linda and Fabian are both pretty spectacular. Fabian is a contractor so always fixes things properly. Any repairs are done quickly and he always gives ample notice if he is going to come by. My partner and I have lived here for about a year and don’t plan on leaving anytime soon.
571,WILLIAMS AND MCDANIEL,SAULT STE MARIE,Clean building and quiet.
572,TODD HARE AND ADAM SAUNDERS,LONDON,Nothing gets fixed when I ask. Even if they are responsible I have to threaten To take them to court. Landlord actually had the nerve to say to a previous tenant that they weren't going to fix anything in my apartments so they can up the rent. Currently have had a clogged toilet that barely flushes for almost a month and they still haven't called a plumber.
573,SKYVIEW - ORANGE MANOR APARTMENTS,ORANGEVILLE,"While orange manor Apartments is a great place to live and the lady who is the building supervisor, Karen, is a super lovely lady and will always try her best to help out but has her hands tied by skyview alot. The only issue with this place is that appliances are bargain bin appliances that only barely work. And if you need anything repaired it's probably never going to be looked at unless it's a water issue, they are pretty good fixing that. But relatively minor issues such as broken kitchen cabinets, or a stovetop not functioning will pretty much just be ignored.
Overall though I'm happy with living here."
574,RMS REALTY MANAGEMENT SERVICE,WHITBY,"The apartment properties are not properly maintained other than cutting the grass outside them. The paint in the hallways is peeling from the walls and ceilings and has not been looked at for over 10 years or more. The front doors are very old with rusty hardware, peeling paint and rusty screen doors. The HVAC heating system needs to be cleaned as there is dirty sooty dust coming from the vents into the apartments. The superintendent appears not to be interested in anything beyond cutting the grass on the property and should be fired. The repair request folder in the laundry rooms is ignored. Also, the washers and dryers should be regularly cleaned and maintained. The washing machine(s) have black mold in the corners of the underneith of the lids. The floors in the hallways and laundry rooms are rarely cleaned. The apartment windows are NEVER cleaned from the outside. The total effect when you get up close is slummy."
575,JAGLADISH LAD,NIAGARA FALLS,"This guy bought the house tried to raose the rent 450. When we said no they refused to replace the fridge stove and dishwasher that all didnt work. Also dwcided to empty our septic bed into the back yard. When we called the city,  they sent us an n12. Then claimed they sold there house which was fabricated documents they are still there today april 30th 2023 and there closing was suposably feb 15 2023. Now they are renovating to re rent it at double the price. Were are just waiting for them to do that and going back to ltb. We took cash for keys we were done with the stress and living in bad conditions we had no heat and no insulation and house was covered in mold. It was a very bad situation. He is a terrible landlord of you see a rental for********* he on a border line do not rent from him hes a bad bad slump lord"
576,TIM KORSTANJE,SARNIA,Tim was an ideal landlord. I had privacy as a tenant but he responded very promptly to any questions or repair requests. He was fair and respectful.
577,JANE CROWLEY,PETERBOROUGH,"I rented here a couple years ago while attending Fleming. She is a live in landlord and knows that gives her exemption from the landlord tenant act she uses that to her advantage at every opportunity. Several instances of racial profiling, Illegal rent increases. Constant bed bug issues that she tries to blame tenants for. When you tell her she drags her feet and acts like its your problem. She does not inform or introduce tenants to her common law husband that lives in the house. Im female and was 19 at the time, about a week after i moved in I discovered an older man at 2 am in the kitchen. I had no idea who he was so i nearly called the police. On top of all of that she then asks you to lie and say he doesn't live there."
578,BRENDA SOUCY,NORTH BAY,A good person to rent a bedroom from as a student. I rented from her for 2.5 years with no issues.
579,JESSICA GEARING,TORONTO,"Kicked us out less than 2 weeks after moving in and has been ignoring attempts to get last months rent back (we paid first and last) Bathroom door doesn't close properly, basment door (the room she rented to us) is ridiculously hard to close and she does not communicate when there are issues and just sends a text saying to get out."
580,MIKE ROSEHART,LONDON,Slumlord through and through. No respect for tenants or safety protocols during Covid. Shows up unannounced and will try to let himself in. Had cops involved many times to remove him from property that he was 10% owner the other 90% lived in New Jersey. Have an entire case built up against him. Do not trust.
581,SHELTER CANADIAN PROPERTIES (CROSSWINDS),OTTAWA,"Sooo quick to fix things.  So clean the smell of the cleaning products bothers me sometimes. Such friendly available staff! So many amenities.  (Activities like it is a cruise ship!)  Had bugs twice in the past 7 years but, again, quick to deal with it. Large apartments But expensive - Rent goes up by more than the minimum EVERY year.  And, although you can't hear people through the walls but you can hear everything through people's doors."
582,JASPERS FAYER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - ORANGEVILLE,ORANGEVILLE,Unprofessional. Rude.  Ignore communications from tenants. Does not keep their buildings and units up to code.
583,KENRON ESTATES,TRENTON,"Landlord is named Mike, he's an older gentleman and he's pretty awesome. I'm against the concept of landlords at all, but since I need a place to live I can't believe I lucked out into one like this. While he's not perfect, he's definitely the best landlord I've ever had. He's a little slow on repairs, but not on the stuff that really matters. Like for example we had a busted sink and he was over same day fixing it. Whereas we have a busted bathroom fan and it's been that way for over a year. Health and Safety takes a hit because the slow repairs have resulted in some problems. Like for instance, there's mold in the bathroom that I deal with because the moisture from the shower accumulates due to the lack of ventilation. I clean it with a sponge mop, but I shouldn't have to deal with this at all in my opinion. Fixing the fan would fix this problem completely. So they get a mediocre rating on repairs and health/safety (it's not dangerous, but it's not hospital clean - that's the scale I'm using.) As for the rest, they have great prices, are more than reasonable with their tenants, and even when serving an eviction notice, discuss it a full year in advance to give you plenty of time to get your stuff sorted out. I recommend Kenron Estates if you're in Trenton or Bayside. They're not perfect, but they are really good."
584,JASON PATTENDEN PRM PROPERTY CORP.,CHELMSFORD,Jason is extremely hard to get a hold of for simple things like minor repairs. He completely ghosted us after we decided to end our tenancy and stole hundreds of dollars from us that we can’t afford to fight him in court for. He didn’t do anything about the fact that other tenants were smoking in a non smoking building and smoke was getting into our unit.
585,HOLLYBURN PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"They take a really good care of the building. The second something is broken, they fix it quickly. Everything is very well maintained."
586,ANDREW NORTHRUP,HAMILTON,"Worst experience with a landlord. Zero respect for privacy and would often show up unannounced or when he knew the house of 6 girls was empty. When called out, he resorted to actual violence. Pointing fingers and shoving people away who asked questions about his invasive check ups. Generally a very creepy man whom I would not feel comfortable around in any circumstances, knowing he had keys to my house made me uneasy. Woke up one morning to him and his friends completing work orders that he didn’t tell us about, and when I emailed him to explain my frustrations he banned me from emailing him again. If you are a university student at Mac I cannot warn you enough - do not associate with this man."
587,DREWLO,LONDON,"665 Windermere: the location is great, the suits are large.
We have a superintendent named Amanda who is an absolute nightmare.
Yelling at tenants, making malicious comments, passive aggressive behaviour abound.
The most disturbing thing is that the Google reviews have been removed; so Drewlo knows there is an issue (there was a petition to remove her) and instead of addressing the problem, they have Google remove the reviews? It’s so shady and unprofessional.
It’s unfortunate."
588,PANADEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"Honestly, as long as you get everything in writing you should be okay. They’re so busy they pretty much leave you alone. Just have to send a few emails about repairs but they get done eventually."
589,DAVE MCCABE / JDN HOLDINGS,LONDON,"Slumlord. Roaches, squirrels, a fire escape on the wrong window, cracked foundation, deathtrap staircase that smells like a barn. Leaves you alone, by and large - have only seen the landlord come collect laundry money and deal with cars parked in the wrong spot. All other work farmed out. Treats younger (not even ""younger"", like, under 30) tenants like disobedient children in conversation. Benefit is you're generally left alone, since his goal is to do absolutely nothing and raise the rent by the maximum amount the Landlord and Tenant Board will allow - so there is some privacy. The building is fundamentally tragic - solid bones, good noise control between units and outside, a good-looking old building; but he's just letting it rot and getting cash out until a high-rise developer buys the land."
590,ADEL NAGM,TORONTO,"Dishonest
House is borderline ready for tear down"
591,"UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, FAMILY HOUSING",TORONTO,"U of T family housing is truly a gem. The building management is quick to respond requests. If anything, the apartment is too secured considering that it has month fire alarm testing and such. The only inconvenience is that since it's an older building many things need to be repaired (water valve, elevator, etc.) which can be inconvenient. But overall, I would recommend anyone to live there."
592,WILLIAMS AND MCDANIELS,ORILLIA,"I've lived here for a couple of years and have had no issues yet. The building managers are always on site doing things, cleaning, ect. Property is maintained on a regular basis ie: grass and snow clearing and the tenants communication is good."
593,SUMIT MISRA,OTTAWA,"Sumit purchased the house we had already been living in for many years as an income property with limited knowledge of tenant laws in Ontario, which meant he came in with the expectation that he could raise our rent by more than 50% if he wanted to. Upon informing him of the law, he first tried making us feel bad that he wouldn’t be able to make the mortgage payments, and when that didn’t work, made threats to move in himself, despite the fact that we knew he had zero intention to do so. We entered rent negotiations with him knowing that our rent was far under market value for the area and because our home needed many repairs. We agreed to a fair raise in rent if he made some changes to the apartment, to which he agreed. However, he somehow got it in his head that we would seek out companies, arrange for the improvements, pay for them ourselves and then he’d “pay us back,” which was neither agreed upon or appropriate. Once we argued that this was his responsibility, he took months to make the changes and sought out the cheapest, most poorly done changes possible. Upon moving out, we had to remind him that we had paid last month’s rent before moving in, which was before he owned the property and to refer to his bill of sale. He also took over a month to produce a tax receipt upon our request."
594,STRATEGIC GROWTH REALTY GROUP INC. & NORTHSTAR PROPERTY,SAULT STE. MARIE,They don’t provide proper service while needed. I had few issues which was occurring in almost every week & they didn’t take proper steps.
595,DMS,BRANTFORD,Dms is terrible
596,ZORAN VRAKELA,HAMILTON,"Repairs were delayed and shoddy and rarely done by an actual professional. Often we would have to ask repeatedly and wait weeks, and then Zoran would show up unannounced at a random time to complete the repair. One repair was a bathrub repair that was left unsealed so that water leaked into the wall, then started rotting out the ceiling of the room below. We informed him that this was happening but it was never fixed during our tenancy.

The other major issue was that when our lease was up and we were legally allowed to go month to month he threatened to evict us (he had no grounds, we were excellent tenants, quiet, respectful, took care of property, never missed rent, but he said he would tell the city he was planning to move in his own family) if we did not sign a new lease. 

The lease was not a standard Ontario lease, it was a re-copied old lease with items crossed out and others added. 

On the plus side, the back yard was lovely and the neighbours were great."
597,SUSANNAH SPEARIN,TORONTO,"Awesome landlords - professional, respectful, and communicate well. Never any issues."
598,CENTRETOWN CITIZENS OTTAWA CORPORATION,OTTAWA,"CCOC refuses to respond to enquiries about holding title.
Sent unqualified/incompetent people to repair flood damage. Years later, repair still not done.
Contractors walked into my place without reason, explanation, or accountability. Landlord refused to do anything about it.
Replaced coin operated washer/dryer with digital machines without a plan for tenants without digital money.
Communication is inconsistent, patronizing, dismissive, and soullessly bureaucratic."
599,NAZARE FATIMA FELGUEIRAS,TORONTO,"Adequate repairs, definitely did not understand the law and attempted above guideline increases many times. Generally speaking a somewhat hostile relationship despite my best efforts to be professional."
600,GOLDEN EQUITY (2686250 ONTARIO INC.),TORONTO,"Fake above guideline rent increase notices, years of problems with the boiler leading to extended periods without heat in the winter, essential maintenance work ignored. Many other problems. Including the company using their access to residents bank accounts to change the monthly amount withdrawn for rent without notice."
601,SIMCOE COUNTY HOUSING,SIMCOE COUNTY AREA,"Critical repairs needed, reported many times over the years, nothing has been done."
602,TIM MYERS,OTTAWA,"Tim Myers and his wife Jane bought the house we rented partway through our agreement. The furnace and AC broke in mid summer and they waited a full week before repairing. Inside temperature was routinely 24 Celsius overnight and they refused to reimburse us for a fan that we otherwise didn’t need. Our lease agreement specifically included AC but they bullied us into contributing to those bills. We made them aware of mold and damaged trim around a window in the bathroom and it was never repaired. They would also show up to the property without notice, but to their credit they kept to the yard and didn’t enter the units. They were easily the worst landlords we’ve had in our 20 years of renting."
603,MANOR PARK,OTTAWA,"The office staff are rude and lack communication within the office, repairs can take years and aren't done correctly, but the rent is cheap."
604,JMN & BIA GROUP - JOSEF & MIRA B,ETOBICOKE,"Strong cigarette smoke odour in the entire building and units, unprofessional behaviour and eviction threats, repairs not completed in a timely manner if completed at all, and completed by elderly landlord, not a professional"
605,MARIO BERTOLINI,OTTAWA,Avoid this man and his son Claudio Bertolini at all costs. They will actively try to bully you out of their apartment to get higher rent from new tenants and aren't afraid to break the law to do so.
606,ALBA MANCUSO,BELLEVILLE,Alba is great. She manages the building with the help of her daughters and a nice couple who live in the area because she is busy caring for her sick husband. She can be tough (I think it’s an ESL thing since she has an accent that makes her come across as blunt sometimes) but overall she cares about her tenants and her properties. I’ve heard horror stories from friends about other landlords in the area so I’m really glad I ended up renting from Alba. I keep to myself and try to be a good tenant so I haven’t had any issues so far.
607,DREWLO HOLDINGS,KITCHENER,"While generally a great company for the time that we lived there, we faced some problems that infringed on our rights as tenants when we left, including:
-holding back our deposit
-expecting significant cleaning, including hiring a professional to clean the carpets prior to leaving
-sending a bill with cleaning costs, and multiple letters threatening legal action if we did not pay

These things are illegal, and Drewlo knows it. We needed a letter from a lawyer to get our deposit back, and they eventually just stopped sending letters after 6 months. If you rent from Drewlo, do not allow them to take advantage of you when you leave."
608,ALBA MANCUSO,TRENTON,"Alba has been my landlord for over 15 years. During that time I’ve lived in 3 of her properties (2 in Trenton and 1 in Belleville). I keep renting from her because she is fair, responsive, and tough on tenants who cause trouble and don’t respect others or her buildings. Some people don’t get along with her because she has standards for her tenants but for those of us who like to live peacefully, pay our rent, and not cause issues- she’s awesome. There have been a handful of times over the past 15 years I have had to be a little late with rent because of unexpected circumstances - as long as you’re a good tenant and honest with telling her ahead of time… she’s super understanding. I don’t see myself moving anytime soon but if I do, it will probably be to one of Alba’s other properties- there are a lot of slumlords out there but she isn’t one of them."
609,THOROLD NON PROFIT,THOROLD,Paid rent on time monthly and have been a great landlord
610,SILVER SPOON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BRAMPTON,"Clean safe unit, inspected yearly for deficiencies."
611,STEVE AND LESIA MAZUR,MISSISSAUGA,"Steve and his wife were very friendly, they have a basement suit that is very suitable for students. The basement was kept clean and whenever I had an issue, they were very prompt in providing a solution. I hope both of them are in good health."
612,VANESSA GYLES,MISSISSAUGA,"Vanessa had a beautiful home and I was originally happy to be her tenant. Unfortunately, she was trying to have a more personal relationship with me, and when I didn’t respond in kind, our landlord-tenant arrangement fell apart very quickly.  I had to leave in less than a year because it was simply too much to handle."
613,EIWO CANADIAN MANAGEMENT LTD.,HAMILTON,"This company should be investigated. I lived at The Olympia in Hamilton for 23 years renting a condo. I was paying $824 a month as of March 1, 2022. I now pay almost $2000 a month. The condo was sold under false pretenses and I never got a dime of my LMR interest. My first 8 years there, I was guaranteed 6% interest which put me over the present rent anyway. The property manager Jenny Williamson said to collect the money from the new owner. What? She should be arrested for theft. Repairs were not done in a timely manner. NO protection while Covid was going on. Parking almost doubled in one year. The whole company is a sham. There should be an investigation about my claims. Stay away from anything this company is involved in. I'm 65, disabled and on pension which is much less than my present rent."
614,PING LI,KINGSTON,"Had a bad experience renting from Ping Li. The house had a mold problem, and when we asked for it to be fixed we found Ping Li painting over the mold. The house seemed to be the lowest quality possible while being just good enough to get you to rent it after a quick tour."
615,SUSAN KERBEL-BROWN,BALM BEACH,Beware of this landlord.
616,L'ESPRIT CONDOMINIUMS MTCC905,TORONTO,Run by people who only seem to care about themselves.  Pipes and windows need replacing but they spent all the money on renovations so building looks nice.   Board uses legal and building resources to oppress residents.
617,SCOTT MOODY,KITCHENER,"Was an illegal unit with 1 exit and tiny windows. I was always afraid I'd be dead if a fire blocked the door. Tree roots caused the toilet in the basement unit to back up all over the bathroom and kitchen. He left it for the tenant to clean. The unit was damp given in basement and was carpeted. Surely it had mold under it as did the bathroom. He wouldn't do anything about it. The water tank busted all over the livingroom. I lost everything I own due to everything being moldy or moldy smelling due to all the water in the unit. I also became homeless overnight and he didn't help with anything but sent lots of abusive harassing emails. The water tank busted due to it rusting but he told me that was my fault. I also went 3 weeks without a fridge when mine died as he was in no hurry to replace it. 51 Pequegnat Ave. Kitchener, ON"
618,EFFORT TRUST,HAMILTON,"Windows so drafty they can blow out a candle and mold lots of mold
Concrete falling off the building and in the parking garage"
619,KEVIN ZHOU,MISSISSAUGA,"Kevin converted almost every room in his house into a room for rent. He lived here with his wife son and sons girlfriend. There were multiple basement tenants, three upstairs tenants, and a main floor tenant. He had his son say that they did not live on the premises when I toured the house, only to find that he did and it was not just students living there. Additional trouble came with covid where he refused to make accommodations for people to leave the rental and move else where. He continued to demand rent when people had already moved out. I disagree with the non transparent practises."
620,MIKE GOLDMAN,TORONTO,"Mike is the worst, most frustrating landlord I’ve ever had. Nice at first, but ultimately a neurotic and extremely nosy person. He installed flood testing devices under every sink, which was fine I guess but then they’d go off if I washed my hands too much and sure enough there would be Mike, texting me looking to confirm there was no flood damage. Every single time it went off beeping he would text. Somehow though he refused to fix the garage floor that was filling with water in the winter, and instead filled it with his own cement himself, which then just cracked apart into pieces of cement in the water. These are a few examples of the many times he did lazy shoddy work himself to avoid ever hiring professionals, but I don’t have the time to list them all. Wish I had better things to say about him after a few years there, but Mike Goldman in Toronto is a landlord to avoid if you can."
621,FOREST HILL KIPLING,TORONTO,"Incapable people manage the building and neglect any common sense. The fact that repairs are so reactive and changes happening so slowly after several tenants leave the building is talking about capacity and management's goals. 
As soon as this management took over the building, problems started arising. Four overnight alarms and building evacuations within 40 days! Several pipe explosions and always city is to blame. Several days without water with portable toilets because of “city.” Uber delivered twenty dollars worth of drinking water is how management fought the situation. After the weekend without water and the supply was restored, management obtained a batch of water so they could show how efficiently they handled the situation. All reactively purchased water is now stored in the container without climatization for future events.
The place is completely unsecured with constant claims about how they investing in security. Place became very dirty with very questionable health practices.  Constant investments into a reduction of energy consumption while building doors were kept open the whole winter, hallway heaters are on at an outside temperature of 30 degC(86 F). The list is endless."
622,YWCA,TORONTO,Elevators always broken. Treat tenants - market rent or otherwise- with no respect. Take photos in your unit without permission. Heating and cooling always in violation of municipal bylaw standards.
623,CHRIS BUCKLEY (WESTANY/WESTANG HOLDINGS),LONDON,"Fridge was broken and all our food kept rotting. They refused to fix it. 
Two of the four elements on the electric stove were broken and they refused to fix it. 
One of the drawers wouldn't open. There were bugs. The bathroom door was broken. No fixes.
We told them they weren't allowed to enter our apartment on a specific date and time and they showed up to do so anyway. We had to stay home from work and keep the door locked from the inside so they couldn't come in. 

Biggest issue was that a leak opened up in my roommates room right above her bed. We spent more than 2 months fighting with them to fix it and they never did. They showed up said 'well it's not raining now so the leak isn't an issue' and left. It wasn't a rain leak because within 6 months of us moving out, the store right below our old apartment suffered a huge flood on account of an unresolved pipe issue. 0/10 do not recommend."
624,SHAMSUL,SCARBOROUGH,The worst!
625,SHANE AND LINDA KENNY,BRUSSELS,"Shane is a dictator, who believes that his tenants are beneath him. He ignores repeated requests for repairs, and does not address them until either forced by the board, or the tenant leaves. The repairs he does on his own, are done cheap and quickly and always need to be fixed again. Does not change air filters in furnace until he has complaints of bad smells, but when he does, he leaves the old ones in a pile to grow mold which cause health issues for tenants. He will verbally make an agreement with a tenant, and then try to use it as a reason to evict a tenant later on. He goes out of his way to invade your privacy, and talk down to you. He has had several cases involving lawsuits, and lost. He is an awful human being, and if you needed a license to be a landlord, he would loose his."
626,PRINCE CHARLES TERRACE APARTMENTS,TORONTO,"They ask for rent increase above rent control limits, every year. Photoshop rent increase notices to appear like you HAVE to accept or be evicted. You can just ignore these notices and pay the minimum amount (2.5%). They have gone through 10+ superintendents over the last 7 years as they do not pay them enough, so do not expect attentive or present superintendents as they have to work additional jobs just to survive. Management will treat you poorly and send you unhinged emails."
627,BERNOR PROPERTIES,BARRIE,"Some repairs requested have been dealt with in a timely manner due to the superintendent being very responsible and diligent, but bigger more costly repairs are very much ignored by the property manager, such as mold removal from unventilated bathrooms, broken radiator controls, building-wide pest control (only individual units treated), and broken or missing window panels/bug screens. These repairs have been incomplete after repeatedly asking for 2 years."
628,EMILIA FARIA,TORONTO,"Renovicted me and my roommates. Lied saying that she was going to move her family in, but actually rented out to tenants (bad faith eviction, we couldn’t pursue legal action for reasons)."
629,JOANNE LALONDE,CORNWALL,"Things in the apartment were broken before we moved in and never got fixed, shared laundry room was rarely working (1 washer and 1 dryer for over 20 units and they kept removing the out of order signs off of the broken machines that we put and collecting money from them) would accuse us of smelling like garbage even though our unit was always clean but the maintenance man's friend who lived maybe 2 units down would have mountains of trash bags in the hallways, as well as get into screaming matches in the hallways daily yet we were the ones who ended up bring harassed by maintenance
Our rent was always paid weeks or days in advance, and I even bought my own materials to repair things that had broken

Eventually when we found a new place to move, I called the property management to ask how to properly give 2 months notice (it was my first time renting) she told me that I had to give it in writing, so right away I went and wrote out a notice for her and called to ask where to bring it/mail it bit never got an answer, called back many times and left voicemail after voicemail and eventually decided to leave a Facebook message and text message with my notice thinking it would be fine, months later she calls me out of the blue asking how I expect to pay her the ""months of rent I owe' I asked her what she meant and she told her I never gave her notice that I was moving, so I reminded her of out call and all of the other calls I sent with no answers, sbe didnt like that answer and I ended up having to block her

Someone I know actually was meant to go for a viewing there not long after I moved out, I'm not sure if it was the same unit so I could very much be wrong, but I feel like they failed at renting it out in the first few months after I moved and wanted to still make money for those months as they know I'm a very honest and anxious new renter and they might have assumed I'd let them take advantage of me

My cousin also used to live in the same building and I was told that the maintenance man had actually entered her unit with no notice and just walked around until they asked him to leave, maintenance man is the property manager's husband

I just reccomend being very careful if you rent off of her"
630,TARIQ ABDULLAH,TORONTO,"Tariq would knock on my door 4 to 5 times a week, every week, just to ""chat"". Felt obligated to respond.

During the tenancy, I was accused of hosting parties and received noise complaints, even though I did no such thing. My heating broke in the winter and it took several weeks for him to respond to the issue. His suggestion was that we slept in warmer parts of the house and wear more clothing. He showed up to the apartment with thermometers to try and justify that the apartment was still reasonably warm (it wasn't, it was inhospitable). 

Flooding frequently occured in the basement, across multiple units.

Interestingly, Tariq did not provide utilities bill, even though I asked at the end of every month. On the last day of my tenancy, while moving out, he gives us the utility bill, which was extremely high (>$8000). This was impossible. I realized that this was almost definitely some kind of scam he was running as I talked to another tenant in the same building who was also given an extremely high utilities bill by him while moving out. He tried to extort money from the other tenant; I refused and suggested that we met later in the month to sort it out in good faith. Sensing that I called his bluff, he never showed up."
631,GRACE KATHLEEN CARTER,TORONTO,"Served with unjust N12, absolute nightmare landlord. Lived in the basement unit, very respectful tenant. Upstairs neighbour was landlord's daughter who is extremely disrespectful and pestering. Avoid at all costs."
632,CAROLINE GRENIER,KANATA,Absolutely horrible.  Had to install cameras in my unit to prevent her from randomly going into apartment without notice or consent. Went thru all tenantbelonwhike fhey were ag work. Was sexist and did everything in her power to make tenants life a truly living hell. Would threaten tenants.  And her furnace once broke in middle of winter. She refused to fix it for 2 years. A tenant had to call bylaw to get her to fix furnace. She made tenants use space heaters for two years and tried charging then extra just to run them. Stay as far away from this place if you value your sanity. Discriminates against women. Would rate all zeros if I could. Units not properly maintained.
633,PROPERTY2PROPERTY,HAMILTON,"So disrespectful. Really rude and unhelpful. I had appliances that were included in the rent not repaired for 8 months. We arranged something with my rent and then Elizabeth and Rick threatened to evict me when I held to it. Rick frequently harassed me at work over issues they caused. He then sent me borderline threatening texts when I asked him to stop bothering me at work. If you have options, avoid these two."
634,SKYLINE,SARNIA,"Seriously do yourself a favor & DON'T move here ! It is NOT safe for anyone & alot of tenants are moving out because of the many dangers here. As of April 2023 so far we have had drug addicted tenants attack another unit with an axe & tried to smash down their door with it, we have had a male tenant found dead in his apt & was not found for a few days, we have had more drug addicted people attack someone with baseball bats & smashed a tenants patio door & broke it. This is not a safe place for anyone especially seniors & children & disabled people. When serious trouble happens we are told to call the property manager & when we do we are told to call the police as they managers refuse to do anything about it. The staffing here quite honestly is a circus show with staff being fired & quitting all the time. They claim to take reports & that they give them to ""head office"" but nothing ever gets done to properly handle all the violence here or the drug problems. There is only 1 maintenence guy for all the buildings on Devine so your chances of getting anything fixed or repaired or replaced are seriously low unless you call City Hall & speak with someone from the Building Inspection office & file a complaint.The appliances here are as old as the building & most of them are old & broken & barely working. The laundry room is another pathetic joke as the drug addicts & weirdos who live in the building are constantly breaking them & the prices you pay to wash & dry are offensive & seriously wrong. It will cost you $6 to do 1 load of laundry so unreal. There is bedbugs & cockroaches roaming the apts & hallways constantly as they only spray 1 apt every now & then so they never will fully go away. The dog owners walk their dogs where ever they want to & let their dogs crap anywhere they want to & nothing is ever cleaned up. This building is like the Titanic slowly going under badly & no one seems to care about that except the tenants. Unless they get proper & stricter management in here & hire properly trained staff this building will continue to decline & resemble a ghetto. What is also needed is stricter background checks & quit letting drug addicts into the building to harrass & make the tenants lives here a living hell. It is no longer safe here day or night you must ALWAYS be on your guard."
635,DONNA BURLEY CHESTNUT,PETERBOROUGH,She's a slumlord who doesn't care about building repairs or safety issues. She's only in it for the money and doesn't see property maintenance as a 'good investment '. She'll essentially tell you she doesn't think it's important. There was garbage in the walls in our unit. There were broken windows she wouldn't fix. The oil heater in the basement was leaking. We had to hound her to provide fire alarms.
636,CAVELLE SIBLEY,BANCROFT,"This woman is so self centered only thinks about her self ! She’s in everyone’s business has put cameras up l on other tentants property facing my house , she spreads so much gossip and makes it so uncomfortable to live here . The List goes on I’m just to angry to get into complete and perfect detail right now"
637,KNIGHTS OF 1626 (BARRIE),BARRIE,"They don't fully fix problems, then blame you for their own ineptitude. 

Being above a rental hall doesn't help for privacy, but there is 0 respect given to the long-term tenants. They only care about short-term rentals. I've had parties under my bedroom until 3:30 AM. 

Repairs are simply responded with a ""can I pop up"" with little to no regard of privacy or legal rights. 

The neighbours follow suit with similar behaviour.

Avoid. They have raised rent at every possible opportunity with 0 justifications."
638,RAJA MAHLI,BRAMPTON,The man gives zero fucks about everything except payment and increasing fees.he is just for the money.
639,"SAQIB SIDDIQUI, NAEEM BAIG, HENA BAIG",TORONTO,"Was okay for the first while but then went downhill when they did not try to help with repairs for critical appliances. Also one of the owners ghosted me completely when I tried to contact. They also threatened a rent increase. 

Really amateur landlords that did not remain professional in situations that cause them to need to take action."
640,CONNIE DEBORTOLI,OTTAWA,"Connie loved to call and threaten to renovict people if we wouldn’t agree to some arbitrary increase. Loved to whine about the property taxes on the blocks of prime real estate she inherited. During COVID she was furious about not being able to evict our downstairs neighbour who was dying of cancer, because she wanted to renovate the place and then jack up the price. He was a good person, he lived there for years before she inherited it, and it made his last few months very stressful."
641,MICHAEL CHEN,TORONTO,"Never in the building so it’s hard to be disrespectful or to invade my privacy when he’s not here. Refused to re-sign the lease unless I agreed to an illegal rent raise in a rent controlled unit. Had numerous apartment issues, one of which almost killed me (can’t post details or it will be too obvious which tenant I am, but I did end up needing to go to the hospital for stitches. Would have been death had I not jumped out of the way. Issue still hasn’t been repaired a week later). Roaches and mice, neither of which are being dealt with because another tenant has a chemical allergy (despite it being totally possible to gas the building and then have it specially cleaned after).  Just grateful I don’t have to worry about bedbugs. Other tenants have physical fights in the hallways, one of them even came to another’s door with a bat. I’ve expressed my fear for my personal safety and he told me to just call the cops. Night with the bay incident cops didn’t show up until 5 hours later. I would move if I could afford anywhere else but the rent despite all of this is still so high I can’t afford first and last for another place."
642,CHANDA ALVAREZ,TORONTO,Great person to deal with. Great knowing the family as well. Did not hesitate to get the repairs done.
643,AHMED ASAMOAH FRIMPONG,TORONTO,"Just moved in the guy owns 15 units,but the most down to earth guy. Just a very good person. The sink was damaged by pervious tenant, he agreed to replace the whole thing. The most calm person I met."
644,FELICE MIRANDA,OTTAWA,"Very nice woman, a little slow on repairs but otherwise an amazing landlord. Would recommend!"
645,ZORAN ZORANOVIC,TORONTO,"Smokes indoors and denies doing so until you have irrefutable proof; walks on his heels and stomps louder when you mention this; stomps on the floor when he feels you make too much noise; blocked all of our basement windows with his “gym equipment”; works out multiple times a week with a punching bag right next to where you sleep with music blaring; loud verbal disputes regularly all hours of the night; spam texts and calls when you don’t answer right away; not at all transparent or forthcoming with you. There seems to have been water damage at some point and the apartment is crawling with mold, mildew, centipedes, spiders, etc. He appears to do the bare legal minimum and wants you to treat him like a hero for it. Good luck."
646,DAVE DEUTSCH,OTTAWA,"Easy to work with, honest, communication is alright. Recommend"
647,LYNE LEMAY/GAGNON,NORTH BAY,"Terrible landlord. When she purchased the building she refused to have basic maintenance done, and removed all of the landscaping that previous owners had done.

She also would have people in to do construction including accessing the unit at very early/late hours. Several times she suggested that existing tenants should leave if they didn't like it. One they left, she'd list at much higher rents. 

A tenant at another building who was paying a reasonable rate was evicted for ""use of unit by landlord"" but as soon as they left, she ""no longer required use of the unit"" and listed it at almost triple the rent. 

If you are being evicted by this woman, contest it, because due to her history of bad faith evictions you have a good chance of winning!"
648,RAHUL,MISSISSAUGA,Pretty good overall. 1bdr basement appt. Charges a living rent. Not the best basement at all but it'll do.
649,TIMBERCREEK / HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Multiple attempts at illegal eviction after they took over the property, evicting as many as they could and then leaving the units empty during a housing crisis. Difficulty getting repairs done in a timely or adequate manner, attempts to enter without notice to “do repairs”, etc. Also put a close friend’s family through hell trying to gain access to their unit after they passed away to retrieve sentimental belongings. Absolutely cruel behaviour. They did make some basic repairs to serious health hazards around the building that were long overdue from the previous landlords, which I guess is one good thing they did, but being better than the previous landlords is a pretty low bar."
650,DAVE CONSTI,ST CATHERINE'S,"Dave has multiple properties in st Catherine's, he owns a salon aswell. He guy threatened me with physical violence on more than one occasion, completely lied through his teeth about the house than changed everything he said after the lease was signed. Badgered me and my wife. Said he would complete Multiple repairs, never did anything for a year except fix his roof. He constantly broke the housing rules like he constantly gets away with pushing people around because they don't know. Like coming in unannounced with no notice multiple times. He does not care about his tenants he uses and abuses them till he can't any longer"
651,ARENTALS,TORONTO,"As far as landlords go, Arentals is totally fine. They fix things quickly and don’t enter without notice. Haven’t had many issues in the building. They are also trying to make as much money as possible so if a rent increase is allowed they will be increasing it."
652,MORGUARD,MISSISSAUGA,I have lived at the Maplewood for over 10 years. Morguard makes a good effort to maintain the building.  The elevators are newer although they still break down from time to time.  They also replaced the roof and boilers a few years ago but of course they raised the rent higher because of these projects.  The new lights in the corridors are nice but they need to paint where the old fixtures were.  The staff are friendly but they can sometimes be slow to repair things in my apartment and something needs to be done about all the kids ripping down wallpaper in th hallways.  Maybe install cameras on every floor to prevent all the vandalism.  Overall a good building and the landlord cares but could be a little better in some areas
653,JOSE SANTOS,LONDON,"Not the worst landlord around, but will take advantage of you the moment you demonstrate your tenant-rights ignorance. Constantly showing up to the property (outside) to check things out and snoop around. Sends too many emails about small things that are inconsequential such as a box on the grass, or a small amount of dirt on the driveway. 

Get things in writing, he has poor communication and English is his second language. This does not stop him from manipulating you in person. From my conversations with him I have derived that he is sexist and homophobic. He uses a rental agency to protect himself from contract liability. my rental agreement was 15+ pages and was clearly meant for a condo residence with fine print about washing my car in the ""parking lot"" (I had a driveway) and other clauses that did not apply to the residence. Was also coerced into getting the ducts cleaned every year because I had a dog and he wanted to protect his furnace... He knows his rights as a landlord and uses them to the fullest extent. Called me a prick when I left, even though I had abided all his requests and did a good cleaning job of the house. Be careful."
654,APLOMB PROPERTIES INC.,TORONTO,"The building is infested with cockroaches, the garbage chute is always in disrepair, and the balconies, windows, and common areas are in desperate need for replacement. The only tenants that put up with all of this are people who cannot afford to leave."
655,SUKHI KANG,STREETSVILLE,"This landlord owns the property at 315-5150 Winston Churchill blvd.

Stay away from this person. Lies about the amenities in the unit. Like provides open parking, but advertises covered basement parking. Does absurd rental increases. Treats with utter disrespect. Does no repair or fixes in the unit that a landlord is responsible for. Instead he pins it on his tenants and scams them with fake repair documentation."
656,MIRJA RAITA,RICHMOND HILL,Mirja was the best. My unit was lovely. It was freshly painted and updated when I moved in. Never had any issues.  Mirja helped me always and even provided a rental discount when I had a hard time.  It was a wonderful home and great neighbours and community.
657,ARWINDER,BRAMPTON,Greedy
658,FONG INVESTMENTS LIMITED,TORONTO,"Great property, terrible landlord. Tried to stop tenants from sitting together in the yard during the summer, and this was pre-Covid. She even put up signs to forbid tenants from sitting in the yard, but they aren’t enforceable signs according to the city of Toronto. Quibbles about pest control and repairs to units, and is double dipping on rental and parking spot increases (also illegal). Many tenants are afraid to challenge this landlord because of the constant pushback (ie when reporting bedbugs, tenants were accused of bringing the pests into the building). Basically will go the cheapest route on anything possible but comes to monitor the tenants regularly. Handed out eviction notices to five units with “reason” section blank to tenants sitting in the yard who would not go inside on a hot sunny day."
659,TRACY MICHAEL,WATERLOO,"Both landlords seemed like they were kind and understand when I moved in. BUT after having inspected the house it was clear that the house was full of filth. There was crumbs left in the kitchen and dirt everywhere. After informing them that I’d like to discuss these matters before paying my rent they began threatening me as if I had no rights as a tenant to a clean home. As the time progressed there were maggots in the garage(no one uses the garage besides them). Our basement flooded and we asked them to reduce our rent for that month since 7 of us had to use 1 kitchen that had no dishwasher and only 1 working stove. They refused to even come in person to meet with us and declined to reduce the rent. Furthermore I asked to park in the drive way since I got a car and they said I’d have to pay. I was perfectly fine with that as it’s listed in the agreement BUT they decided to increase the price for parking including an inconvenience fee for when they came to the house (there are no other cars parked in the driveway and could hv easily parked next to mine). They also threatened to kick us out when we wanted to discuss our rent when the house flooded. They treated us as if we had no rights and should keep our mouth shut even though the living conditions were worse then any form I’ve been in (I’ve seen some terrible dorms). They were so rude and tried taking advantage of us just because we’re students. Like we have no right to stable living conditions just because of that. Additionally any email we sent was replied to with a formal tone scrutinizing the littlest of details filled with passive aggressive threats. The landlord is a psychologist and to think she would be manipulating and abusing her rights over young students should be considered against the exact oath she sore to. The day of clean out they talked down on me and the my other house mates infront of our parents because the house wasn’t as clean to their liking. Yet when we moved in the house was a mess, there were earwings and insects all around and as I said before food and crumbs on the floor. Yet they seemed to all of a sudden expect us to clean more when the living conditions the house was given in was FAR worse then what we tried our best to keep it as. Also they are very sly and sneaky and will visit without giving notice. They violated several tenant act agreement rights KNOWING that tenants have more rights than landlords yet abused their power simply on the bases that we are students and easy to take advantage of. We have rights to. I hope no one ever experienced what I went though. I hope someone reads this post and never lives at 450 hazel avenue Waterloo with those landlords. people like these who prey on the naive deserve nothing especially not your hard earned money."
660,MET DZIAK,WATERLOO,"I have lived in a unit owned by Met Dziak for a few years, in this time I have not required repairs to the unit or had any issues with safety. He will often make excuses to enter my unit such as 'insurance inspections' and use this opportunity to inspect the unit, even taking pictures inside my apartment without my consent. He has made comments about 'keeping garbage' in the unit (a personal recycling bin, he provides 2 household sized bins for 5 units) and has complained multiple times about tenants keeping cats (which is a right which landlords cannot restrict).

If I never had to interact with this landlord he would be good, but in all my interactions with him he seems like an angry old man who does not respect his tenants."
661,GREENROCK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,Over 50 tenants showed up to the landlord and tenant board to contest this landlord’s latest above the guideline increase. This landlord was trying to recuperate the cost of repairs that were not necessary. The CEO was rude and did not appear willing to negotiate. He gave the impression that he was another out of touch rich old white guy. Many tenants were not impressed. I most certainly was not. I do not recommend living in a Greenrock residence.
662,ALKET KULLA,PETERBOROUGH,"DO NOT RECOMMEND. I would suggest reading articles about his s*xual assault allegations, he was found not guilty but given info the articles contain about the case mixed with him renting to many young and unaware female students and my personal experience with him being creepy, I would not recommend renting with him at all. Otherwise, extremely unprofessional, left me without heat and hot water for over a week, will not respond to messages, withholds deposits, and has shown to be extremely verbally aggressive when angry."
663,OLD OAK PROPERTIES,LONDON,They're extremely lazy. Will not get to you within a timely manner for issues with your room.
664,GWL REALTY,TORONTO,"Overall decent behaviour from the staff, they are friendly and get back to you in in a matter of hours or if it’s after hours you can be sure to have some follow up by the next day. The increases have the appropriate legal amount of time before issuing (paper notice will be given) and follow the allowable increases.

Pools closed almost strategically so you don’t ever get to use it but they can advertise they have one? Garbage chute is weirdly not working frequently. The plumbing is horrendous, back ups, hard water, mold, leaks so while they can be timely with patch repairs or sending someone to fix things the problems are reoccurring and worrying. Should have noticed the water damage when I moved in."
665,COGIR,OTTAWA,"They don't care about maintenance, do below code repairs cheap as possible, 
Report a mold issue good luck take them months to deal with with it. When comes removing mold they hire contractors that don't take proper procedures to remove.  Let spores got through out house.  Also any mold left on walls they just paint over it. 

Missed $1 on rental cogir won't tell you take u straight LTB  end paying dumb 180 filling fee. 
They in it for money not health well being of the tenants.  

Management also won't care privacy they leak out your info to other tenants.  When comes repairs make sure you have cameras in your place they will do more than what they intend to do for repairs etc. Most times.they abuse unit inspection thing just to spy and belittle more in hopes you move out so then can reno older units jack rent super High...

Lastly older tenant they target you hard for renovictions."
666,AMPEX PROPERT MANAGEMENT,SCARBOROUGH,One of the worst building in town. Very pporly managed. No respect for tenants. You will get lungs problem if you stay there over 3 months. Stay away from living here
667,HABIB SAMI,OSHAWA,Stay far away from this guy he will enter your unit illegally he will shut your power off harass you and manipulate you in anyway
668,SIREG MANAGEMENT,ST. CATHARINES,We had at least 3 issues needing attention.  All 3 required essential maintenance 8j our bathroom.  It took over a year and a half for anything to happen.  Shitty ass scumlords oh and they make you pay 250 to hook up your own ac
669,BIN MANAGEMENT,SUDBURY,Landlord would rather be sued than fix things. He never pay’s even if he loses. Roof has never been changed and leaks. No upgrades since 80’s
670,JOHN BALL,PARRY SOUND,"Rent is outrageous, and any updates done to the building were done poorly. Gives zero cares about maintaining the building. Doesn't have a superintendent or maintenance man, and lives out of town, so good luck getting issues dealt with in any timely fashion, if at all.
Definitely the worst ive had, and I've had landlords that spit on me and cursed me out when I've asked for things to get fixed, but at least the spitter and the sailor did the job eventually."
671,TED INGRID,WATERLOO,"Decent landlord, and accommodated repair + pest control requests at his expense. Pretty responsive and transparent rental process. The repair guy never gave us 24hr heads up but generally kept out of our way. Uses custom rental agreements that include non-enforceable clauses such as pet fees, visitor limits etc. Feel free to request a standard Ontario rental contract or ignore those clauses."
672,HARPER MANAGEMENT SERVICES INC,SAULT STE. MARIE,"I ended up renting in this apartment back in 2018 and it was owned by a man named Don. He was very good with how the place was well looked after, the floors were cleaned and well inspected daily and you could tell the inside was CLEAN by the fluids they used for keeping the floors well done (the scent was very potent, you knew some deep cleaning was being done that day!). The rent starting point was a wonderful $725 and only went up to $750 in the summer of 2019. However once 2020 came around the company was bought out 3 DIFFERENT TIMES by different companies, the first one raised the rent to $790 still fine, then the next company bought us out and upped the rent to $850 and barely looked after the place. There was no cleaning, there were no inspections of how the place was looking, the apartment building ended up getting bed bugs as a result of how poorly the place was being looked after. These rent price increases kept getting worse and we were only told a week prior, and didn't even tell us where to send the rent until we looked up the company name and ASKED and now this THIRD company came and bought up the property which is the one mentioned above and once again DID NOT look after the apartment we were in and boosted the price to $925. We had dealers in one of the upper floors that'd throw parties and endanger tenants, we had cops show up constantly to deal with things until finally after most of us complaining they kicked out the tenant. Please do not rent from these people, they're greedy and only want your money."
673,ERIC ALMEIDA,GUELPH,"This landlord will talk to you in an incredibly pretentious and condescending manner. He made us sign an illegal lease agreement requiring us to agree that he could charge us an extra 100 dollars for everyday we were late on rent after 2 days. He also made us agree that we pay the an extra amount of utilities should the utility bill be higher than the expected average utility bill.  He never fixed my window even though he was supposed to, he will chase you down about paying the utility bill with his arbitrary deadlines which have no legal right to be held up. If you live above the garage prepare to argue about what times he can use the motor to open the garage as the motor will vibrate the entire room. He repeatedly attempts to use this arrogant tone to talk down to his tenants. To those of you willing to live with this man who has an absurd need to dictate the lives of his tenants."
674,KEN NASTOR,WINDSOR,"Ken is one of the best landlords I have ever encountered. He is kind, respectful, & treats all his tenants like hard working humans. He’s happy to lend a hand when he can, & is upfront & honest in all situations. Truly a gem."
675,JON & CAROLINE BOUMA WILLIAMS,COURTICE,"These people are criminals! They rent out an illegal basement that is infested with mice, rats, maggots, mould just to name a few! They watch your every move and harass you about it! They watch you on there cameras which records audio without consent! Absolutely disgraceful disrespectful and disgusting people DO NOT rent from 40 Darlington Boulevard in Courtice ON"
676,TERRY RUSSEL,ANGUS,"Shows up unexpectedly, Downey cooperates very well, doesn’t respond to emails or phone calls."
677,GEORGE FALTAS,BRAMPTON,This landlord will not rent you if you are not his kind he is Arabic and he literally is evicting all old tenants from the building to put his people in he will purposely bring you to the landlord tenants board you will not put your proper information down so you have no idea you're being evicted until the sheriff shows up hes a snake he listens to every conversation in the building he has cameras that record conversations he fixes nothing the building is a disaster He interferes in personal business between tenants he is a slum Lord. There's nothing you can tell him he knows everything he is the most disrespectful human being I have ever met in my life I lived in my home for almost 12 yours and he literally took my home out from underneath me and to top it all off right now I got a letter from the hydro company that I owe them $1300 that hes racked up in renovation bills for the building using the power from my old apartment and he refuses to let the hydrocompany in for them to shut off the power in my apartment I am fighting to get the power shut off before my bill goes any higher he refuses to let them in the building. I'm telling you I don't understand how anybody can get away with treating human beings the way this man does I didn't know I lost my home until the sheriff showed up and knocked on my door.
678,HAMILTON MANOR APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"This building is sub par with lots of basic maintenance issues( no  heat, no water, pest control, lack of cleaning in common areas) Management communication is not professional."
679,CARMEN MANGER,PEMBROKE,"Knows there are nice getting in, fails to provide traps. 
Was given specific directions on methods of communication, fails to attempt to follow."
680,MORGAN STE. MARIE / MORDINI RESIDENTIAL,OSHAWA,I lived here last year while I was in school and it was an excellent first apartment. Any requests or concerns for maintenance were very quickly addressed. All staff that I encountered were very friendly. I did not live there through any rent increases but the one I did receive paperwork for one before I was was very reasonable.
681,Q RESIDENTIAL,ST CATHARINES,"Repairs : It's a corporately held building that since we moved in has gone downhill precipitously. I have encountered problems getting Residential Managers to get things done, often taking a week or more from reporting an issue to receiving assistance. Most recently it was a problem of the sinks in the kitchen not draining. I was having to bail out my sinks like the US has to bail out banks... It took 2 weeks to get a plumber in to fix it, and when he did, it took him about 10 minutes to fix the issue. He also fixed my water pressure issue, no idea how he did it, but he went to ""the mechanical room"" and when he came back, my water pressure was almost back to where it was when we moved in. Pool was closed during COVID, which I understood, but didn't reopen (not because of repairs) until the last week of summer last year, and was open for that ONE WEEK. The pool was the only reason we took this apartment.

Health and Safety: Never had cockroaches before... Just killed my first one in my kitchen today. Black mold on the bedroom ceilings in the winter. Only goes away if I run my Air Conditioner all summer, but inevitably comes back after a few weeks of fall weather.

Rent Stability: Oh the rent is stable. Stable on the increase every year. Whether or not they've done ANY repairs. 

Tenant Privacy Rating: The building has ONE Residential Manager. When I moved in we had 3... She's ill, and is breaking down from having no help for going on 8 months (since our last Residential Manager retired). And is supposed to be not working after April 30th. And as of April 29 she has not been replaced. Our Residential Managers have all been amazing, but one by one, they fell, and no replacements were found... Guess we have no one to call for repairs and such as of May 1st...  They are good about not being overly intrusive with me. But. I think they know better than to bug me too much.

Respect: I don't feel respected when they raise my rent for no reason, cut the amenities, and don't replace the people who make living here easier. I'm not sure I would reccommend this building to my ""friends and family"" I would in fact probably be embarrassed to tell anyone Q Residential runs my building. All they care about is money money money..."
682,RENT PERKS,LINDSAY,Cheap. Do things half a** or cheapest way they can do without hiring a professional and threatening.  Don’t care.  Takes advantages of tenants that don’t know their rights.

684,MICHAEL SMITH,PORT COLBORNE,Terrible landlord
685,THE YORKLANDS @ HERONS HILL,TORONTO,Building is falling apart. Non stop renovations trying to fix bad PM company desicions. Every summer there is rain leakage in a different floor.  Garage floors have gone throught two renavations already. Building stracturea is full of cracks. Gym has broken equipment for a couple of months already. At least one elevator is always or out of service or in use by the PM staff not allowing residential usage. At the current rates of the area def not worth the price.
686,YOUNGKUN PARK,TORONTO,"- keeps entering the living room and kitchen unannounced and uninvited. Sometimes when we, the tenants, aren't there.
- threatens to throw away stuff you are storing in the living room closet. Doesn't understand that touching stuff that doesn't belong to you is literally theft
- has been caught in the act of doing the above"
687,DANIEL LOBB AND HAEYOUNG (GRACE) CHOI,OAKVILLE,"Have absolutely no business being landlords. 

Refused to salt the icy, cement steps down to the unit. Threatened to charge me damages if I salted them. Told me they charged the previous tenant to fix the steps that they put salt on. Suggested I ""hold the railing"" instead of putting salt down.

Told me to not leave the motion sensor light on when I wasn't home and to ""use the light on your phone"" when returning home in the dark.

Entered the unit without notice on several occasions, I was home during one of them.

Did not keep unit properly heated. Often being 15-16⁰C in the middle of winter. Had to request the heat to be addressed on multiple occasions over the course of almost 2 months before they had someone come check the unit (and discover that the dampers were closed).

Very nosy and invasive. Asked about my partner staying over ""more than 7 days a month"", asked if I ""use the door (to my unit) at night"".

Raised the rent $500 (legally) to force me out, then listed it for only $100 more than I had been paying.

I had to call the landlord and tenant board as well as legal aid on multiple occasions. I heard from the neighbours that all previous tenants had similar complaints."
688,BYRON RENTAL PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"Byron bought my building after I moved in. I was fighting the previous landlords to make repairs from the previous tenants when the change over happened. The new landlords were still refusing to make repairs like the flooring has broken through where we have had to cover with tape to prevent splinters and tripping. Bricks are falling off the building, roach problem, unreliable repairs. Super has had to write signs in marker on colored construction paper. They changed parking companies but didn't tell anyone that we were paying for parking to a company that no longer existed and were not protecting our cars. Guest also paid for parking the non existing company for months."
689,WELLESLEY PARLIAMENT SQUARE,TORONTO,"The worst management in all my years in Canada. They are giving accommodations to tenants who don't know how to use toilets, laundry, stoves and garbage shutes. Smoking marijuana every night and day, the smell goes into every ventilation in the apartment. The laundry is filthy dirty that it would be even scary to wash feet never mind clothes. The machines are disgustingly dirty with roaches, mice and dust everywhere. Disinfection of the laundry machines must be done at least 2 times a day, but the money is been charged for this ""service "". There was a ""disinfection"" done to cold water, after this ""procedure"" the water smelled to chlorine twice stronger, and we are taking shower and washing face in this water. Our hair started to fall off, and this water is very dangerous for health. Landlords don't care about the water because they are not bathing here! Hallways are filthy dirty and dusty! The cleaner can vacuum once a month. The parking is in critical condition, the ceiling is supported with metal poles, leaking 24/7. At any time the ceiling can come crashing down and nobody cares! After the fire in 2018 the repair was done only on top not inside. The cracks are coming through, the floor is inflating in some places, and when we came after the fire there was a stinch of chemicals and mold. The landlords are increasing their rent every year, but no service. Every time they are recalculating the rent for previous years! There is no peace and quiet with these buildings, tenants are screaming and yelling and having parties after 11pm, sometimes at 3am, and the security guards are lazy butts, only eating and sleeping on the job! Nothing will be done unless you personally come out onto the balcony and yell at them. Homeless people are coming to our building, taking everything they want on the parking lot, going into the laundry to wash clothes in the sink. The apartment's front doors are very loose and it's normal for the management , someone is looking through the mail box in the evening. There are cameras, but we believe that they are dummies, not functional. There must be a building inspection done 100%! The only thing is that plumber and electrician comes as soon as you ask. I would never recommend to live here, not even to my wort enemy! Run"
690,MEGHAN MCGUIRE,OTTAWA,"I’ve moved around Ottawa a lot since moving here for school, and Meghan is probably the one landlord I would love to rent from again. She is kind, considerate, responsive and respectful. She would get repair persons in within days (or sometimes less) of us notifying her of needed repairs or concerns. She is friendly and considerate over text and I genuinely felt like she cared about us as people. Even after moving (only moved due to roommate leaving for school) she tried to help me find a new suitable place to rent! Her units are modern, well-maintained, and clean."
691,KUMARIE NANKOO,CAMBRIDGE,"Not a good place to live. 
Its loud you can hear your neighbour's talking, the stairwell carries the noise. 
laundry is expensive and isn't well maintained.
The mailboxes are not updated they are broken half open most times. They are  not in working order  and can't revive any medium to small packages! 
Very hot in the summer cant live with out ac.  Hot in the winter becuase the heating is controlled by the landlord  and they claim there is no thermostat
They watch  you on the cameras
Bad parking 
And locked entry and landlords only give you one key for main door to building and the key can't be copied
The wiring is  old not many plugs I have no outlet in bathroom."
692,NORTH44 PROPERTIES,MARKHAM,"- Argumentative when I ask for landlord repairs. 
- Does not reply to e-mails. Instead they call to criticize and scold for bringing a problem to their attention. Even then, they may not do anything about the problem.
- There has been an exterior exit light at 1 of 2 entrances broken for years.
- The front door has been broken causing the door unable to open from the INSIDE. It took a week to fix this fire hazard.
- Nobody picks up litter around the property.
- I have never seen the Landlord doing their ""rounds"" on the property. It would be nice if they would introduce themselves to the tenants.
- The Landlord is unapproachable, if they can even be found."
693,MEGAN MCALLISTER,KINGSTON,Megan and Ryan are great! Very responsive and respectful
694,TOM SCOTT,WINDSOR,"F/21 I was a tenant of his for about 6 months before breaking my lease due to domestic violence. This was a student rental accommodation shared with 3 other females. The basement was full of mold and the stairs were not up to code, so bad that my mother slipped off the bottom step and broke her foot. She did not sue as she did not want to cause issues with the landlord at the time. 

Tom was okay with housing a tenant who was $1300 behind on rent and figured the best way to remedy the situation was by refusing to come fix the single functioning toilet in the only bathroom we had. Our fridge went out as well days before the incident and he still refused to come and fix it until her missing rent was paid. 

The tenant who jumped me was the one behind on rent. I kept saying pay your rent to her until she snapped and lunged at me. I do think that tensions were running high in the house as our appliances and toilet were breaking down. It was added stress to us as young students in school. 

I called my parents to let them know I was breaking my lease as the cheques for payment were from their account. My father spoke to Tom about the situation and all he could keep rambling about was how I had an obligation to pay my lease. (I broke the lease legally as domestic violence is one of the top clauses for breaking a lease in Ontario) He kept repeating that he would be getting his $500 monthly no matter what. My father had to tell him that his disregard for the safety of all involved in the altercation was disgusting. He did not ask if everyone was okay, if anyone was injured etc. only cared about where his $500 was coming from. That was when my father started discussing the issues with the bathroom, fridge, with the basement and how my mother had broken her foot. All he could say was “oh I see. Because I won’t let her end her lease you’re going to pick at my house now”. My dad just simply stated that he didn’t appreciate how little this man cared about our health with all the mold and the fact that we had no running toilet for days at a time. 

I moved out within 2 days after the incident, 2 streets over under a different landlord. Tom continued for the next 4 months to attempt depositing my “owed” rent. He never once reached out to me formally to discuss what had happened and instead decided to try taking more money from me/my family. 

He only stopped when we had to put a block on the cheques through our bank and explain the situation to them with proof. 

Turns out he owns multiple properties in Windsor and had only been out to see this house twice since he had purchased it 2 years before. The worst landlord I have ever had."
695,FALSETTO GROUP,OTTAWA,"Bad rental experience. Unresponsive to messages, and gives contact information for one brother when other brothers name is on the lease as an excuse to not execute things. Completely blocked off our entrance without notice for “repairs”. Refused to do any repairs and help with mouse problem. I paid for a parking spot, which they would rent out to others for neighborhood events without my consent or knowledge. Refused to give rental receipts which I needed for tax purposes. I think they target inexperienced student renters that don’t know their rights to get away with being negligent landlords."
696,BLAKE PARTRIDGE,BARRIE,"The unit was upstairs from his office. He promised to keep the adjoining door closed.
He frequently came out the adjoining door and walked upstairs to my apartment. There is not a door separating the stairs from the apartment.
He often yelled up the stairs.
He complained that the hydro bill was too high. He complained that my music was too loud. He complained that there were ""smells"" (they were from baking. I guess he doesn't like food?)
He decided to throw me out and submitted a false claim that he intended to move into the apartment. He subsequently rents it all the time.
I couldn't attend the hearing as I was due out of town on that date so he got away with it."
697,OREST KELEBAY (OAK CREEK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),TORONTO,"Slumlords. Lovely historic buildings in West Toronto allowed to fall into disrepair. Rude, invasive, impossible to reach. Landlord's clueless handymen broke a window in another unit two years ago and it is still not fixed (I have since moved).

DO. NOT. RENT. WITH. OAK. CREEK."
698,HOMESTEAD,OTTAWA,"Do not recommend. The office was very disorganized, they did not have a computer, could not receive emails, but suggested we send things by fax? Responded to voice messages about 50% of the time, but not until days or weeks later. Overcharged multiple times for parking despite tenants going through the proper channels to cancel parking spot well before the required deadline. They assigned people to parking spots that already belonged to another tenant so we got angry notes on our cars more than once. Parking lot was horribly maintained in the spring, several spots completely flooded (so high the water would be inside your car) and no alternative parking offered. Impossible to get ahold of them to find a solution to this issue. The worst of all was the plumbing issues. It frequently began backing up despite having nothing in it besides water. The maintenance person said this is just how the plumbing is throughout the entire building and that it will keep happening. Weeks later they discovered the pipes were leaking inside the walls in a bathroom which lead to mold in one of the other rooms. A few floorboards were completely black from the mold. When they came to fix it, they sprayed something on the floor and that was it. When asked if they were coming back to replace the floor boards and they said spraying it was enough. Not a good experience."
699,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,We have neighbours who sound like they hammer the wall everyday. It gets annoying.

701,HELEN (GALINA) BOJOVIC,NIAGARA FALLS,"Does not process human communication skills, dealing with her is very very hard."
702,JOHN O’KEEFE,OTTAWA,"John O’Keefe was the worst landlord I have ever had. I’ve moved close to every year since I turned 18, so I’ve had quite a number. He has YET to pay back my mail key. He put a change machine on our washer, and our washing machine was in a closet, and it was growing black mold in that area and he argued us up and down until he finally re did the area! He has made sure to get his money back and will harass you for money, but does anything he can snake his way around to not pay anything back."
703,PARAMOUNT | LORD MOUNT BATON,OTTAWA,"This is one of 4 properties managed by Paramount near moonies bay. 

The buildings are dated, though they are reasonably maintained. Rent is below average for ottawa though it shows in some aspects. Notably leaks and extreme drafts being very common due to old plumbing and balcony doors having no seals left in most units. 

Laundry is expensive at 5 dollars a load, which they are trying to increase by 25 cents in the fall despite clear objections from tenants that were promptly removed from signs by staff. 

They use lights which take $12 replacement light bulbs so every fixture only have half the number of bulbs in them as they should in each unit. 

Lastly our bathroom does not have a fan, so mold is a very legitimate concern."
704,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Smokers Paradise!!!! So many tenants smoke weed and cigarettes in their units. Management doesn’t care. I saw contracts smoke in the garage and tenant’s balcony. If you have a family, avoid. If you are single, perfect place for you"
705,MARK REESOR,PETERBOROUGH,"I've been lucky enough to have a few good landlords but Mark was probably the best. Super nice guy, very responsive to maintenance issues/requests, never any communication issues. Only reason I left was because of a job change that took me to a new city. Can't recommend him enough."
706,MINTO,OTTAWA,No complaints been renting from minto for 10 years now. Always answers repair requests in a fast manner. We had a fridge issue and they came the same day to get it fixed just a recent example.
707,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"We rented with them in Windsor for a couple years and while everything started off solid, things went downhill the minute something broke and needed fixing. Getting repairs done, whether it was an electrical issue with appliances, a flooding drainage line in the basement from tree roots, a rat infestation in the yard, or various leaks in plumbing leading to damage to drywall and flooring, you could guarantee that it would take ages to address, the work would be the cheapest and shoddiest fix possible (screwing a window with a broken lock shut and writing ""window lock"" beside the screw in marker, putting caulking on a hole in a pipe instead of replacing the section, running extension cords to appliances to avoid fixing broken outlets), and the crews sent to do the work would only be getting paid to fix a single problem per call, even if it was multiple problems they theoretically could resolve.

At one point, after two years of paying the rent in full, promptly and on time, the rent increased (they max it every single year) and we hadn't adjusted our PAD form for the fifteen dollar increase, and they sent us an eviction notice instead of simply calling to resolve the error.

When we finally gave our notice that we were leaving, they listed the full address of our rental on Kijiji, so along with the multiple (four I think?) scheduled showings they set up (often with 2 or more prospective renters at the same time, and once sending 3 couples to our front porch and never actually showing up themselves at all), we also had daily randoms coming up and looking in our front windows, and when we complained about this, they brushed it off like it wasn't a problem.

The best way I can describe them is that they have big city corporate ambitions and attitudes with small town never had to deal with competition unprofessionalism. They have a large share of the absentee landlord market locked down in Windsor, but if you can avoid them, do so."
708,MAYDA KUDLOW,TORONTO,"Absolute worst rental experience in 15 years. Very rude human being, zero respect for other humans including ones renting her property! Lied constantly. Ignored severe issues with apartment that threatened safety, lied repeatedly about plan to do repairs. Apartment should not have been rented out in first place, she hid problems that very quickly emerged after moving in. Worst black mould I have ever seen which she displayed zero concern about. Took advantage of students/low income folx. Invasive questions asked of guests."
709,WELLESLEY PARLIAMENT SQUARE,TORONTO,"The management has been very sneaky about the rent increase. Since the 4 alarm fire thy have done nothing to improve the building. The walls in the apartments are cracking down, and seems to be bubbling up, the painting is chipping off from the ceiling, walls and the balcony ceiling.  The parking lot is another disaster. There are lots of supporting poles to support the ceiling which is about to fall. It is leaking everywhere, the cement is falling; therefore, there are lots of wholes. It looks scary and unsafe! The tenants in this building is always making fire, so you will get sick and tired of the fire alarms. The tenants are also smoking Marijuana and the smell comes through every hole in the apartment. The management only has money in their eyes. My mom is very sensitive to mold, we start to cough and sneeze every time we come home. There must be some substance in the wall that was not removed! A building inspector should come and inspect the building and close it down until it is completely fixed!"

715,DANNY LEBOVITZ,NORTH YORK TORONTO,"This landlord did not return my damage deposit and over payment amounting to $1,548. I have to go through tribunal to see if I can get my money back this way. I gave him a 90 day notice he even had me give it to him in writing. They kept harassing me and implying I was smoking in the house, making me very uncomfortable because I was not smoking at all. They even went so far as to threaten me by putting smoke detectors beside the shared door, and without a 24 hour notice! And not because of fire safety, no they were trying to intimidate me and scare me into not smoking indoors which I wasn’t doing to begin with. I also professionally painted the basement kitchen which has a broken window. He didn't say a word, not a single thank you, but the paint job is beautiful and adds value to his  rental unit. This landlord cannot afford to rent. I paid early one time and he freaked out on me and demanded extra money. I had to text him our landlord agreement (he refused to provide a lease) and to which he replied he mistook me for someone else. This landlord is one of the WORST so noisy so dark the unit was moldy there was a broken window and they were single pane and it was middle of winter. Never rent from these people they will abuse you."
716,MINTO PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,Worst rental service ever
717,TREVOR DRINKWATER,CAMBRIDGE,Best landlord ever!
718,MORGUARD NAR CANADA LP,TORONTO,"Trying to be vague in this review for fear of retribution.  I have lived in my apartment for over a decade so I pay substantially well below current market value thanks to rent control.   For this reason it is nearly impossible to get them to do repairs.  One of the contractors told me when they finally did come to do the repair that they were told by management to only fix the worst part and not replace another part that also should have been replaced years ago.

Some of the repairs they do are done so badly that on several occasions I have to re-do the work after they leave.

Pest control for the building is done by a big name company but they must have a deal with them to do the least work possible so on paper they appear to comply with the landlord tenant act.   I have caught them faking a bug treatment and when I brought it upstairs to management they shrugged their shoulders and said ""yes, we have had reports like this before"".

The building super uses the fire department intercom to make general announcements such as contractor cars parked in wrong spots.   This intercom blasts in every apartment at 200 decibels.   To make matters worse the building super repeats everything twice like the fire department does as if it is really an important thing.

I have a stack of notice of entry papers where they don't even bother to show up.   I like to be home when they enter the apartment so this is extremely annoying when they are a no show.   I have seen them enter my apartment the next day after they missed the day given (they knocked on the door but I sat silently just to see what they would do).   In my opinion this is a form of break and entering.  The super at the time who opened the door for them just blamed the lack of paperwork on the contractors!"
719,REGENCY ON MAIN,HAMILTON,"Management at the Quadreal Regency on Main is horrible. They do not take tenant concerns seriously. There are multiple safety issues that arose during my tenancy including issues with homeless persons in the building, vehicle break ins, package thefts, and constant fire alarms in the middle of the night. When issues are brought up to management they are basically ignored. To call this building a luxury apartment is comical. You should only rent here if you want to be completely taken advantage of as a tenant and have your concerns ignored."
720,RAKESH PATEL,VAUGHAN,"This guy claimed my parents had to move out because they couldn't afford whatever the hell they were doing anymore and essentially pushed them out. This was after multiple attempted illegal rent increases. My parents failed to secure an N12 form because they believed his heinous lies. Within six months Rakesh and his wife had relisted the home for $750 more than my parents had been paying. after minimal renovation. Rakesh also asks for two cheques to pay rent, one made out to him and one to his mom, which tbh sounds like tax fraud to me - if you want to partition your money you do it yourself. I'm only sorry I didn't convince my parents that Rakesh clearly was a greedy and incompetent landlord until they saw him re-list after coming to them with some sob story about his own finances."
721,GREENROCK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"This Landlord will charge back their tenants for repairs that should have been made to major systems ongoing - they wait until the break down, do not carry any warranties or service agreements to support (at least in prior years to this review), and hide behind the new ""for the blue colour, not the people"", ""Ford"" option that allows them to increase rents on a non-standard basis, for things like HVAC (and FOUNDATIONS) that should be working as they are already included in the lease agreement. When these mechanical issues breakdown, they apply to the new municipal ignorant system favouring landlords, for NON-STANDARD increases to the rents you agree to when you sign on initially - and repairs for your simple living pleasure, will then come out of your pocket (or depending on your finances, potentially leave you unhoused), EVEN, as they make incredible gains in a system that is broken by lack of affordable units in Ontario - and particularly, Toronto. BEWARE."
722,AMANDA WHITE,TORONTO,"Amanda is the best landlord I ever had! Kind, considerate, and below market prices for a great place. Very flexible and accomodating."
723,DEREK GREEN,PETERBOROUGH,"Unit was in subpar condition, but habitable. I got splinters from the floorboards multiple times because they were so worn. There was also a mouse problem. Other than that, my biggest issue was this landlord’s communication. When I told him I couldn’t afford his apartment a month into the pandemic, he was very rude and said “don’t expect to get 24 hours’ notice” for showings. He conducted in person showings despite public health officials’ recommendations, which I had flagged for him, and despite the fact that many if not most other landlords were doing virtual showings at that time. I offered to film a complete walkthrough for prospective tenants, but he said my choice was to either deal with strangers walking through my house or pay him the $1500 he was concerned about losing. He had three weeks to find new tenants by the way.

If you do everything exactly as this man wants, you will likely have few issues, but know he is quick to anger and will become oppositional if challenged. Based on the direct quote above, he also takes a flippant attitude toward tenant rights when they inconvenience him (and yes, he did end up doing showings with less than 24 hours’ notice)."
724,MEHRI FALLAH & PEGAH OGHABI,TORONTO,"I want to stick to the facts so that nobody ever rents from this mother daughter duo. 
We lived at 825 Church for almost 4 years when we were handed an N12. Not for a minute did we believe they were being honest but we didn’t want to fight. Instead, we kept an eye on the unit in the event that they were in fact lying. During our tenancy, they regularly showed us that they had very little understanding of their responsibilities as a landlord. They tried to charge us “the first $50 of any repair” when the track lighting needed to be fixed, they included a no dog clause in one of the schedules attached to the lease, they tried to withhold the one months rent owing to us as part of the N12 for potential repairs, attempted to have us pay for our last month rent accusing us of not paying for one of the months during our tenancy, and tried to avoid paying us interest on our last months rent claiming “they’d never paid any other tenant any interest”. Thankfully, we were well versed on our rights as tenants and didn’t get swindled by them. The condo was a brand new building. We complete the initial inspection on move in and marked up the walls for them to have them repaired. We dealt directly with the condo when our track lighting broke and took great care of the unit. Every single rent cheque was cashed and paid on time. We were model tenants. 

Turns out that they were lying when they gave us the N12. They ended up signing a 3 year lease with a luxury rental company and got an extra $500/month in rent from them. Thanks to our detective skills, we compiled evidence to prove they gave us the N12 in bad faith and sued them at the LTB and won. They had to pay all our moving expenses and the difference in rent for a full year, nearly $10k. I would have been happy with $0 if it meant they would never be landlords again. Alas, we knew we couldn’t prevent that but we know we caused them a lot of grief. Hopefully this site and this review helps someone too."
725,SAVCA BOSIC,KITCHENER,"Highly recommend Savca and her husband as landlords. They are respectful, responsible, and kind. Love having them as landlords."
726,SURINDER GHAG,TORONTO,"I'll put it this way - I recently met somebody while at work, and through congenial conversation complaining about horrible landlords, we had both discovered that we shared the very same horrible landlord we were both talking about. You do the math on that."
727,RALPH ROTELLA,PORT COLBORNE,"This landlord does not address repairs and heath concerns when informed of issues, he in turn resorts to yelling and threatening eviction- issues include falling exterior brick , mold, leaky appliances etc"
728,SIMCOE SUITES,OSHAWA,"They're great at listening and repairing stuff when it's broken.
However since they bought the property they've been in engaging in tactics to try and get rid of current tenants so they can renovate and charge way more.
This includes; removing amenities, attempting to make us pay more than the lease agreement for air conditioning in lump sum ahead of time (including tenants who do not have AC as a separate charge). If we don't agree to pay they have said they will remove the AC unit at cost of the tenant.
I don't see why anyone would agree to pay for months they aren't using the AC for, let alone for a rate above the agreed upon amount.

So, renter beware."
729,SOMMER ABDUL,HAMILTON,Sommer has replaced broken appliances same day and even on holidays (she got me a new fridge ON NEW YEARS EVE!) and has always been very responsive and understanding. I definitely lucked out.
730,WEBSTER APARTMENTS INC,LONDON,"As a tenant for 7 years, my take on the current landlord is they don’t treat tenants with respect. They neglect their duties. They encourage unsafe and illegal practices (when a smoke detector is beeping, rather than replacing the smoke detector, they tell the tenants to turn off the circuit breaker). In addition, on April 29th, at least 19 tenants had recieved N13 forms saying in August they are being evicted for “repairs”."
731,VON WESTERHOLT PROPERTIES,MILVERTON,"Very poor at communication. Allows the superintendent to enter apartments without notice. Continues to support a superintendent who is rude, volatile, and harasses tenants. Building is rented as family friendly but is not - staff are not nice to people who have kids and constantly making new rules to limit what kids are allowed to do (no sidewalk chalk etc). When leaks or other serious issues are reported the staff have gone so far as to accuse tenants of damaging things on purpose in order to make them look bad.

We would move if we could afford another place."
732,KG GROUP,TORONTO,Pretend to be respectful but aren't. They were in our unit ALL the time and didn't always give proper notice. It felt like they were always looking for an excuse to snoop on us. When we'd ask for a repair they would do it the cheap way and it'd only be a matter of time until we needed to call them up again to fix the same thing then they would do it the cheap way again. Unit was very unevenly heated which meant one room would be hot and the others cold. They did an AGI application and had a lot of over the top items included despite not even having accessibility buttons on the doors. Our visitors rarely got a parking spot even though there were a bunch and we found out they were doing nothing about tenants renting the visitor spots to their friends. Found them to be super condescending and felt they were not respectful at all. Was very glad to leave!
733,GREENWIN,TORONTO,We've lived here for about a year and a half and have had a good experience. The building is so quick to respond to any of our maintenance requests. They always provide notice before entering and I don't find it excessive. The hallways are dated and should be refreshed  especially for the rent we pay. The maintenance and cleaning crew are always working and the building is kept in great condition. The suites are being renovated as people move out but the quality of renovations leave a bit to be desired. Overall this company had been good to deal with.
734,SKYLINE LIVING (SEAWAY TOWERS),WINDSOR,"Constantly find excuses to enter your apartment.  It's only April, and they've already entered my apartment five times this year, for a whole sundry of reasons.  Landlords should only be entering once a year for checking fire alarms/smoke detectors, and then only coming in if I request repairs, not to constantly fiddle with the water tank and the hydro meter and the windows.  Also, they just put window limiters up, so since we don't have AC, we will probably succumb to heat stroke come summer.  They claim it's a safety issue.  But when I complained that rainwater is pouring in through the exhaust vent above my ELECTRIC stove and soaking it and my kitchen floor whenever it rains, they refuse to do anything to fix it because ""it would cost too much to rent a crane to go up the side of the building to cover the vent.""  So electrical fires don't seem to be a safety concern.  

In short, they only repair what they want to repair, usually things that make your enjoyment of your home worse and not better, and they invade your privacy every chance they get.  It's not the worst place I've ever lived, but I certainly don't recommend it."
735,CHERNEY PROPERTIES,PETERBOROUGH,"Very polite and professional, quick to respond to inquiries, and adhere to provincial standards. When I’ve made mistakes (such as forgetting to update my tenant insurance, etc.) they’ve given me the benefit of the doubt and kindly notified me to correct the issue. Most ideal place I’ve ever rented."
736,CHRISTINE OSZTER & LENN CURTIS,WINDSOR,Really amazing landlords; very receptive to any needs and very attentive to the rental.
737,VALENTINA ROSLIN,TORONTO,Valentina was the meanest landlord you could imagine. She would stand outside the door and yell nonsense. She threatened me and my guests with physical harm. At one point she actually had a restraining order after assaulting a tenant. Great location and building but be ready to deal with her.
738,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS - TRAFALGAR SQUARE,GUELPH,"Excellent on-site team of warm and approachable people. Communication with them was always easy, efficient, and respectful. The apartments are a bit old, but they are constantly making upgrades to bring them up to contemporary finishings. They sometimes apply for above guideline increases, but it goes towards useful things such as window replacements. The only criticism I have is the lack of air conditioning."
739,DAWSON PROPERTIES,THUNDER BAY,"Definitely a group who defines what they do as ""passive income"".

Snow removal?  If we're lucky.  Repairs?  If something is literally falling apart, and even then...  

But you can bet they never fail to include a yearly hike for maintenance.

In the 3 years I've been that has included :  Painting the doors.  (once) Emergency repairs.  Replacing the archaic buzz-in system with a slightly less archaic buzz in system.

What it has ignored:  The single entry, pothole singularity that is our parking lot in any way, the 30 year old laundry facilities.  Any kind of snow removal or safety for walking on the sheer ice their negligence has produced.  Evicting the violent drug addict in our building.  Answering their phones during business hours in the past year."
740,BBPM,BRANTFORD,This building itself it outdated. There are cockroaches and the elevator breaks down monthly leaving seniors and young families stranded! The promise fixes quickly but the super on site is a complete joke! Half the building is seniors the other 1/4 are young families and the rest are drug dealers!!! It’s a sad sad place to live
741,TVM HUNTER STREET,PETERBOROUGH,"The property manager, Tammy Deneault, is a nightmare to deal with. Expect for your things to not be repaired and for near-constant harassment from Tammy and her goons. Tenants think the apartment is the Taj Mahal so they're especially nasty; but it pales in comparison to the offerings from Ashburnham Realty. The building says they are pet friendly, but this is a marketing lie. They will harass and persecute all pet owners."

743,JANESSE LEUNG,TORONTO,"Landlord started out very nice and friendly, and was the typical absentee landlord living out of country. When in town she would show up without proper notice for aesthetic repairs but I never made an issue of this. My lease included wireless internet, but the modem in my apartment served two other apartments in the house so I was expected to field calls from other tenants and spend time on the phonr with the service provider troubleshooting whenever there were issues. She began disliking me when the decades old appliances began breaking down.... the fridge broke and I had to nag for a replacement, the washer broke and leaked into the downstairs apartment. I later discovered she had also complained to other tenants about me because I didn't agree to maintain the front garden. The breaking point was when she moved back to the city and realized how high rent had gotten, and began seeking reasons to evict me so she could renovate and re-rent for more. She started throwing accusations including things like keeping the front sunroom too messy (this was a shared space, and most of the mess was old supplies she had left there), and paying rent late when the rent had been paid on time via EMT, she just didn't deposit it on time. :S  In a fury one day she discarded everything out of the sunroom including a pair of boots and several coats of mine. When we finally ended up at the LTB for an eviction hearing for late rent, she admitted in mediation that she wanted me out and late rent just seemed like the easiest way to achieve it. The eviction would have been dismissed but I settled for a cash payment and got out of that.  I would highly recommend staying away from this landlord."
744,MINTO,MISSISSAUGA,"It’s very true.. the longer you live here, the less they care. What they really want is you to get so frustrated, you’ll move out… allowing them to do (questionable) upgrades and hike the rent substantially. We have had to endure construction for years. Disruption and headaches for many years that are tantamount to putting lipstick on a pig. The units are still old and decrepit and not worth the astronomical amounts they charge. Maintenance is a joke. The only thing that gets their attention is water damage and mould. Your a/c or 40 year old appliances will just have to wait!

749,VINCENZO COMMISSO,HAMILTON,"When I was shown the home, Vincenzo (""Vince"") and his wife Angelina seemed like a dream come true. They were polite, friendly, helpful, and just seemed like the kind of folks who would never present any issue. I would be renting in a house, starting with one upstairs roommate and two more empty bedrooms on my floor, that might get filled. I was fine with that. I moved in around March 1st 2016. There were a few growing pains, but nothing I considered out of the ordinary for a new rental (we were his first tenants) and new tenant/LL relationship.

That all changed the morning of 13 April, I woke up to strange noises coming from downstairs. I went down to the kitchen and found the noises were coming from the unfinished basement. I feared someone had broken into the house. I found it was actually construction contractors. Vince had decided to do work on the basement without letting me or my roommate know (24 hours' notice required). He also had not told the *contractors* that he hadn't told us they were coming, and for their part the workers actually supported our shocked and angry response. They were also hugely embarrassed by what happened and on Vince and Angelina's behalf. This also meant we could not use the laundry facilities, which were part of our lease. We were told the work would take ""10 days"". By May 31st, it had been 49 days and the work was still ongoing. Construction was to take place weekdays, Monday to Friday between 8am and 4:30pm. It also took place outside these hours, and Vince would show up unannounced on weekends with construction workers in tow. Initially the work specified was to ""underpin the existing rubble foundation"" and ""install weeping tile"". Past a certain point our relationship and communication deteriorated and he would not explain what other work he was doing. I noted at one point that the wall insulation was touching the hot water tank on two sides and the furnace on one side. The construction was so loud, we couldn't sleep or were woken up. My girlfriend stopped visiting due to the noise level, and my roommate and I both stopped having friends visit.

He did not provide us with a garbage can until evening 29 May / morning 30 May. So between March and June, he blamed his tenants for ""not taking out the garbage"" when in fact the city workers would refuse to collect the garbage from the curbside unless it was in a garbage can. No green bin (composting) was ever provided that I recall. Also when I first moved in, the blue bins (recycling) were filthy and full of assorted pieces of wood; this had to be dumped out and stored (lest the landlord accuse us of destroying or dumping his property), and then the bins had to be cleaned.

There were no carbon monoxide detectors present (as required by law) when we moved in, these did not appear until 24 March. When they did appear, they were the plug-in kind. CO detectors for tenant units are supposed to be hardwired into the electrical grid with battery back-ups. There were smoke detectors installed before we moved in, but the batteries were dead. I bought batteries myself and was never compensated. There also was no smoke detector on the upstairs roommate's floor, and to my knowledge one was never installed. No smoke detector or CO detector in the basement; not sure if they were installed after it was finished. No CO detector on the ground floor. Also when detectors were finally ""provided"" he left them on the kitchen counter still in their packaging, we had to install them ourselves. 

On 20 April I asked Vince for his email address; I never received it. I don't think there's a legal obligation for him to provide it, but I was trying to facilitate communication and thought it was a reasonable request. I also asked for a phone number and email for Angelina. Eventually got an email, but no phone number, and she said she only checked the email ""every couple days"". God forbid something important come up.

When we saw him in person and we made comments, complaints, asked questions, raised concerns etc., he never wrote any of it down.

The refrigerator had a built-in water dispenser which leaked, causing water to seep out from under the bottom of the fridge. This was never addressed.

We conflicted over access to, privacy in, and responsibility for common spaces. Vince's view was that we were renting our bedrooms (or in the upstairs roommate's case, the entire attic suite), and that the common spaces were not ""ours"". Yet if the common spaces were not ""ours"", he would not take responsibility as though they were ""his"", refusing to provide such items as a broom, mop, vacuum, dustpan, or dustbuster for months. The rented space being ""limited to a bedroom only"" was not mentioned on the tenancy agreement, I never agreed to it verbally, nor was it discussed when I viewed the home, or when I came to sign the lease. 

Various HVAC vents were stuck throughout the home, and the furnace/AC was inoperable for several days, in 30+ degree Celsius heat. I later found out that he had been lying about it being broken, when in fact he had turned it off intentionally using a switch on the wall. It actually worked fine, he just didn't want to pay the bill which he was responsible for. He also tried to tell us what we could and could not set the temperature at.

The place was advertised as ""furnished"" and, as I mentioned, Vince said he ""owned"" the common spaces, yet he did not provide a tablecloth, coasters, placemats, or curtains. Not that I required the tablecloth and stuff, but I also didn't want to damage his furniture. The furniture feet had no felt on them, so we had to be careful not to damage the floors. No iron or ironing board, no oven mitts, no microwave, no toaster, no shoe rack, no bath mat, no stoppers/plugs for the tub and bathroom sink. Upstairs roommate bought a toaster and microwave herself, and (rightly) took them with her when she left. She attributed her departure to, among other factors, gender-based harassment and other harassment she faced from Vince.

No coat rack; I had a coat rack that my mom had gotten me, but not a screwdriver or screws, and anyway at this point I was leery of ""damaging"" VInce's walls in case he got angry about it.

""Inspections"" and entry without notice; he would repeatedly show the empty rooms on 3 hours' notice, repeatedly enter the basement without any notice at all. The basement had a separate side exterior entrance, which had a lock. Then from there you could go down a set of stairs into the basement or up a set of stairs through a door into the part of the house where we lived. This door between the basement and upstairs did not have a lock on it -- meaning that despite the basement eventually being a fully finished suite with its own kitchen and bathroom, the downstairs roommate would have full access to the rest of the house, despite Vince saying otherwise.

The stove was a gas stove and we never received any confirmation that it was safe or approved for use. Not a fan of gas stoves in general as I came home at one point in the early hours of the morning and someone had left the gas on with the stove off. (It was not the upstairs roommate as she had had enough and moved out at this point, but several others had moved in.) I can't blame Vince for someone else leaving the gas on, but as I said, we never received word that it was okay to use in the first place. Anyway I vented the home and nobody died, yay.

About developing the basement, he told us to our faces that he ""didn't know what he wanted to do with it"", then I overheard him talking outside to someone about showing her the basement and renting it out, so he lied to us about that.

After a certain point when he kept coming into the house without any notice, I literally called the cops. The cops claimed it was a civil matter and not something they could intervene with. But they did point out that it looked nothing like a ""rooming house"" as he claimed.

Then he brought up renoviction and relativiction, gobbing off about how he could kick any of us out at any time if he decided he wanted to work on our rooms/spaces or have his daughter live in the house while she was in college, or have his dad move into the house for whatever reason. Just absolutely gross harassment and nonsense. We got a threatening letter from his fancy lawyer up in Toronto. I called the lawyer back and the lawyer never returned my call, probably because he knew they didn't have a legal leg to stand on. I was frankly surprised the lawyer agreed to write the letter in the first place given he must have known how much trouble it could get them all into. 

Vince demanded post-dated cheques for rent (which I had not realized are actually illegal in Ontario), yet he would not provide proper rent receipts. He repeatedly and proudly referred to the building as a ""half-a-million-dollar house"", but clearly hadn't bothered with inspecting it and acted like anything we asked him to do that could possibly cost him any money at all was financially impossible or extremely difficult (such as issuing proper rent receipts - like, are you trying to tell us you can afford multiple houses but can't afford a printer and a few sheets of paper?). The receipts didn't even have his name on them.

It was clear they hadn't bothered with inspecting the house, because every little detail we brought up - and even the big, blatant, obvious things that nobody could fail to miss walking by - to do with the house, they acted like it was a complete and total surprise and shock to them. I can't blame them for the way the house was before they bought it, but it was their job to inspect it and make sure it was up to snuff before putting it on the rental market and letting us move in. Like the smoke detector batteries, that cost me $20. I asked them, would they want another landlord to treat their daughter like this? Or Vince's dad?

The dryer squeaked. The dryer, that was in the basement, squeaked so loudly you could hear it in the attic loft, with all the intervening doors closed. Oh, and the dryer also ran on gas, and squeaking to me always implied metal on metal, which implied the possibility of sparks, which did not seem to me like a good thing with a gas dryer. 

I offered to mend the relationship, but they weren't interested, asking me to move out instead. On the previous occasion where police attended (after I called them), the officers noted to me that none of the rooms were individually numbered; there were no separate mailboxes; two of the bedrooms shared a vent; etc., i.e. there was no reasonable way to construe the accommodation on reflection as anything resembling a ""rooming house"" as Vince and his wife tried to claim it was. 

In general, Vince seemed to make a habit of agreeing to things and then forgetting or disregarding them. I told them I was going to start recording any conversations we had in person. 

Oh, also one of the post-dated cheques bounced and they tried to make an issue over the NSF fee ($75), but dropped it when I said I'd learned that stipulating post-dated cheques was illegal, and that they violated the law and my rights by not providing information about the Landlord and Tenant Board, and our respective rights and responsibilities, when I moved in -- despite knowing that I was a new resident to Ontario. If they'd provided that information, that would have prevented any question of an NSF fee. 

By the end of it, Vince stopped talking to me entirely and I was dealing with Angelina. She denied receiving post-dated cheques (like we didn't have an entire text message convo between me and Vince talking about it), and characterized my emails as ""threats"". (If it's threatening to know and discuss your legal rights, call me a threatener, I guess.) I had to spend fifty bucks to buy new cheques from the bank, too."

751,VITALI MOUSSANOV,HAMILTON,"Does not do background checks and allows dangerous people to live here. One previous tenant left, leaving a woman with mental issues in his apartment, which she set on fire not too long after that. Now he complains about not getting money on time (a matter of 2-3 days at best) when it was his own fault for the damage caused; there were numerous acts of vandalism and threats from the individual involved, and nothing was done. As a matter of record, he does not treat female tenants with much respect, and is very old fashioned bordering on chauvinism. We also have a major drug dealer in the Complex that he turns a blind eye to…numerous cars pulling up at all hours of the night, and a lot of pretty obvious hand offs, all on camera I might add, that make us all wonder just how much they’re paying him."

There was water damage everywhere, mold in the master bedroom, and when we signed the lease we were told brand new laminate-wood floors would be installed throughout the finished basement… they put the pieces on top of the old carpet! The floor was like walking on a water bed, and of course the planks didn’t stay together because it wasn’t on the proper ground so it became impossible to keep clean. We also got carbon monoxide christmad morning from our hot water heater, which he didn’t see a reason to replace because he had built an illegal closet around it and didn’t want to have to take down walls"
753,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,OTTAWA,On-site employees are generally polite and do their best with occasional exceptions. Even the property manager seems to try his best. Unfortunately over the two decades I have lived at the Champlaine Towers the quality of care has gone down. Repairs are talked about for many many months and even years before they seem happen and same thing with pest control and upkeep. Homesteads newer properties are much better looked after according to people who live there. It feels like because were an older building we aren't looked after well. the tile carpeting was out in to make it easier to change if there were problems but that doesn't seem to happen. Its disappointing to watch the building go down but its much too expensive to move.
754,DERRICK PARSONS,COURTICE,Derrick was a good landlord overall and kept up with repairs. When it came to him selling the house it was very clear he didn't know the landlord tenant act as he had us sign N11s agreeing to end the tenancy. He made it feel like we had no other option.
755,CONCERT PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,"This review is for the Serrano building managed by Concert. The building had regular pipe leaks in and is in need of constant repairs. While the repairs and done relatively quickly, I don't believe they've been done properly or comprehensively as the leak has reoccurred several time. They replaced the pipe that was the issue but only part of it and what wasn't replaced then leaked again. During the repairs which occurred 3x in a year, the wall had to be cut open once and repaired and then a second time where the whole bathroom vanity unit had been taken apart. I wasn't able to use the vanity for storage from Nov 22 to Feb 23 due to the many leaks and repairs."

760,BOB PERKS,KITCHENER,"We rented an executive townhouse, we were in the 2nd unit in. There were 6 units in total, I'm numbering them 1-6 starting from the left most unit. Bob ""hired"" the tenant in unit 6 to manage this property. These units were all advertised as ""executive townhouse for families"".Within the first week it became very apparent that unit 1 was rented by 4 people in their late teens/early 20's. 2 of the four were a couple that argued and threw objects while fighting at the shared wall. The bedroom wall was shared with our 5 year old son. From Thursday to Sunday they had non stop parties with the stereo cranked until 4 or 5am, and police regularly called not just from the noise, but their guests were parking in other people's driveways, passing out on lawns and even a few times on patio furniture they removed from other peoples yards. The police were already fed up before we moved here and had stopped responding and referred everyone renting to landlord tenant board, and other property owners to the city or lawyers.
The tenants in unit 3 (we met at the school, our son and their daughter started jk together) and we walked them to school together almost daily, after the first week or two they let us know the previous 2 tenants in our unit complained about the tenants in unit one and were forced to break the one year lease and move in less then 6 months because Bob refused to do anything other then refer everyone to speak to the manager in unit 6. Unit 3 had regularly complained as well since they could hear the music and banging from unit 1, it was quite literally so loud in unit 2 that they heard it clearly in unit 3. When unit 2 sat empty the manager said it was loud to unit 3 because it was echoing in the empty unit.
By the end of the third week we were regulary packing up our 5 year old and 7 month old and slept in the basement Thursday to Sunday with ear plugs in and a mobile running non stop to try and drown out some of the sounds from next door.
Bob asked us to mediate with unit 1 and the manager. Manager said for us to go and knock when they were being ""too loud for the babies"" and ask them to keep it down. The way she said it I'm confident she meant us and not the children. Thursday rolls around and I gave it until midnight to go and ask the to keep it down. Knocked and rang the bell for 10 minutes until someone was leaving and let me in. I stood in the doorway uncomfortably until a very drunk girl came and said she was one of the ones who paid. I assume she meant rent but she was quite hammered and could have thought I was delivering pizza since she tried to tip me and offered me a drink. When her boyfriend clued in he came over and told me to ""have a beer and chill the f@#% out"", and told me how they disconnected the door bell because of the cops and everyone showing up and pointed at the lines of coke on the kitchen counter and winked. Wow. I just repeated I've got 2 kids under 5 and we need to sleep, please lower the volume. It was turned down, by next to nothing, I walked out and got to my door to hear everyone laugh and the stereo turned up louder then it was before. Friday night I was back at midnight, this time their front door was wide open so I walked in to find the manager (in her 50's clearly trying to recapture her youth) doing coke with a bunch of 20 year olds. It was clear at this moment we would be also breaking our lease.
Found out Bob had signed contracts with the utility provider to have regulators put on the furnace to shut it off during high peak times. I found out first day there when my air-conditioning didn't turn on in 35° weather while trying to unpack. He did everything he could to save a dime and it was always at his tenants expense, even when utilities were not included! I had to buy a couple of portable air conditioners for during the day when the central air didn't work.
Second month in I gave our notice, my son's teacher called us several times because he kept falling asleep in class because of the chaos we were forced to listen to. We moved here from 3 hours away and had no friends or family in the area, and we couldn't afford to stay in hotels so we were left with no option. Bob didn't appreciate that I served him this paperwork at the real estate office he worked at. He was very angry and demanded I speak to him in front of everyone there and asked me what was the issue and I explained (what I said above) and several more lovely moments we had, including not being able to use our yard with bottles and drug bags (sometimes still containing product) made it unsafe for our kids and was utter BS for almost $3,000 a month. (Westmeadow Drive, lower upperclass neighborhood at that time). The strange people on my patio and in my back yard, etc. Since he wanted to discuss it at that moment his coworkers heard everything and that's when I found out one of the tenants in unit 1 he told them was his daughter (later found out not his daughter but sugarbaby and saw explosive fight when he caught her with someone her age and the manager who he was also ""dating"").
After notice was given Bob sent his son 3 or 4 times a week to ""inspect or show"" the unit with no notice, and quite often forgot to bring people with him to ""show the unit to"". 
We were able to move with 3 weeks overlap of both places. On the first Thursday of the overlap we stayed at the new place and came back Sunday evening to missing boxes, damaged property and our kids piggy banks smashed and money gone. (Sentimental value as these were built by a relative that passed away a month before we moved and devastatedmy oldest). Bob told me the manager hired the tenants from unit 1 to clean up our unit and must have given them the wrong date. 
If this man's name is on your lease, RUN. It was an utter nightmare to live through and I found out with the tribunal he started putting his properties in his kids names to make it harder to sue him as this was one of MANY properties he had ""a daughter"" at.
Ask before signing a lease if the name on there is the manager/owner/caretaker. When you have to deal with the tribunal its a hassle and adds a year (before covid) to the process to track down who is actually responsible for the property."
761,PHILIP DEBLASI,TORONTO,"Doesn't give notice, puts off repairs until the last second, and the pear control is a joke"
762,GANDULF MAYFAIR,OTTAWA,"Great landlord - good communication, quick on repairs and questions and respectful."
763,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,Failed to fix rat and raccoon issue during the 6 months of tenancy. House was filled with black mould he refused to address. He came into our apartment and moved stuff around. He booked a showing giving us only 1 hours notice and came into the house without knocking or us consenting to the visit. Worst landlord ever. Also verbally assaulted one of my roommates for not being grateful that he painted the apartment before we moved in.
764,INTERFAITH HOMES,NEWMARKET,"We have been here for almost 2 years, had move here because the landlord sold out previous home. We moved in the height of the pandemic. 

We moved in and we noticed that we did not have operational fire alarms, brought this to the managements attention, they came and looked at the problem. My son ( 4 years old with a chronic cough due to allergies) was home and they refused to enter, even after I explained he was not sick. They left us fire alarms outside our door and told us to instal them. Problem is we don’t have any ladders. They didn’t care. Finally had to get the fire department involved and suddenly they were able to instal them. 

Our bedroom is above a garage and it will not hit the minimum legal temps. We have kept temp logs and given them to them and it’s like they don’t believe us. They have had some service people in to change the furnace but it was never a problem with the furnace, it’s the windows. We have been left with this problem for over two years and they will not help us."
765,MARK STEPHEN - REALTOR,WINDSOR,"Mark has been to LTB at least eight times, the number he mentioned before we went to mediation as I accidentally paid him last month’s rent twice. He made up fake claims about issues in the apartment as a way to not give my money back. He refused to answer my calls and then re-rented my last month to another person as I had to leave a few weeks early. We went to mediation where he was ordered to pay me $450 and then he said that was too much so took money off of that, I only received $320. At the time, I was quite young and intimidated but this man was very disrespectful. He is a realtor in Windsor."
766,GEORGE GEORGOPOULOS,OTTAWA,Just save yourself the headache and don’t rent here.
767,FOREST CITY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"Khalan is one nasty slum lord who ruins people lifes and belongings, He move families in to cockroach /red ants infested apartments knowing so , he plays dumb when you show him evidence when everyone in the building says its a problem for years, This is not a safe building complex for families with kids, needles ,drugs, gang violence happens on a regular. "
768,MAYDA KUDLOW,TORONTO,"Terrible human. Rents her place under the market value, but there’s a reason for it. Unkept old properties, rats and mold. My unit smelled like gas and she claimed it was okay so I moved. She’s around her properties every day to go through trash and mail that isn’t hers. She’s lost people’s letters several times. Cn be threatening if you don’t put up with her bs. Do not rent with her."
769,STARLIGHT OWNS/SIGNET MANAGES,TORONTO,"The corporation recently bought the building. Our previous superintendent kept the building clean and well kept, inside and out. Now, the floors are filthy all the time and gardens/lawn are a mess. They renovated several units and doubled those rents. The noise and mess from construction has been significant. Many cosmetic changes throughout the building with halls painted, carpet installed in halls that now never get cleaned, new hall lights but those were all ok before. Laundry room upgraded but prices also increased."
770,LAKE FOREST FARM INC,BRUCE MINES,"Located on a massive acreage of land that you'll have no access to is a small, rapidly sinking 2 bedroom home, known as the ""Nothing is Wrong Here"" house.  Upon entering the enclosed porch through the makeshift door you'll encounter multiple infestations to greet you. Entering through the non secure door into the moldy, illegally wired kitchen where you can enjoy a cold glass of tap water reminiscent of dark ale.  We ask that you keep your shoes on at all times as we prefer to measure all of our floor boards 1/2"" short. 

Allow your attention to be drawn to the water feature ceiling throughout this home, offering multiple indoor water falls.  

In the living area you will find 6 large windows that each contain their own independant ecosystem.  Extra effort has been put into making these windows inoperable in order to preserve spore growth of the endangered black mold. If you have any questions at this point please feel free to engage with the ants that reside in the wall.  

The first bedroom will easily accommodate a chair,  and the master bedroom luxuriously offers you space for a double bed - and has its own independent water features and ecosystems.  

Bathroom includes a shower with a full size, non frosted window that looks into the bush where you can easily see if anyone is watching you; and the same dark ale quality of water as found in the kitchen.  Should you choose to change the style of the bathroom the floor tiles are conveniently not adhered to the floor.

Cost of heating is included in the rent and to remain carbon friendly there is no functional heating equipment available.

Summers at this property will encourage steady weight loss as the non functioning windows provide an environment that out does any sauna.

Landlords will show up immediately after being contacted with no given notice, and will save you time with responsibilities by losing your mail. Don't let this amazing opportunity to become critically ill pass you by!"
771,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"I've been renting with them for 3 months now, I had issues with the tap and rat problem and they responded in a week and fixed them. So far so good."
772,UDAY MODI,WINDSOR,"Did not fix anything in the property, even the things that were directly violating safety issues (the fridge broke and it took a month and 100 phone calls to get it fixed) and asked us to move in a year, because he wants to rent it for higher, I believe. Always said that I'm doing you a favor for letting you stay (I mean I'm paying rent, I feel like it's the opposite.) One of the worst landlords I've ever seen in total."
773,RICHARD ALBERT,GUELPH,"Rick doesn’t believe in maintaining his properties. Upon moving in multiple windows didn’t open, carpentry ant infestation, refuses to do anything about wasp hives, refuses to make basic repairs like safety railings, tons of mold, broken appliances that are included in the rent, and calls by-law instead of speaking with tenants about landlord responsibilities in hopes of intimidation."
774,GO-MANGO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT LTD,WINDSOR,"Horrible people those couple. Our unit had mice and they did nothing about it. We ended up finding tenants ourselves to replace us. When they gave us the unut, it was awfully dirty. We hired someone with our own money to have it cleaned but the property is so old that no matter how much we cleaned, it never got clean.
Worst and dirtiest 6 months of our lives. They were very much disrespectful too."
775,SKYLINE LIVING,KINGSTON,"Advertising non smoking, still smokers,"
776,KATHY BARTKOWSKI,OTTAWA,Property manager. Simply an unkind human. Cold and will always blame the tenant. Likes to throw around eviction notices and does not like when you know your rights. This type of personality gets hired to do the dirty work. Avoid avoid avoid.
777,RICHARD LER AND BRAD ATKINSON,"VAUGHAN, NEWMARKET",Terrible Landlords that have no idea what they are doing.
778,ALKET KULLA,PETERBOROUGH,"Absentee landlord. I have done my own repairs at my own expense because he never responds to communications and it was costing me money to wait for him.
He doesn't provide receipts for rental payments, not even the yearly summary for income tax purposes. We are just a money grab for him."
779,MACDANE GROUP,STIRLING,Excellent landlord repairs done in a timely manner.  Grounds are kept super clean and very friendly contractors working here.
780,MAPLE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,VAUGHAN,Absolutely the worst property management company in the world! Saud the owner does not care about renters one but! He has taken a once half decent building and turned it into an unsafe slum!’
781,TYLAINE DUGGAN,TORONTO,"Tylaine is a tottaly insane person. Please, do not believe in her apparently ""kind"" personality, because she is not. So if you want to share a room and find this address: [address removed], RUN AWAY! She was racist, she stole my money, she mistreated her cleaner pushing her out of her house and throwing her clothes out during winter. Then, she plays the victim role because of her age, so please, do not lose your money and mental peace!"
782,KIPLING TOWERS,ETOBICOKE,I live at [address removed] and the landlord is the worst and his superintendent is very rude she keeps taking money and bribes from tenants and treating others unfairly by allowing some tenants to do something and others not according to how much money they pay secretly for the superintendent. It’s unfair and unjust this must stop.
783,DAVID HOU,NORTH YORK,"David is a wonderful and responsible landlord! He is always on top of things, more than willing to solve issues together, and is very professional. He even gives us a welcome gift when we first moved in!"
784,MINTO,NORTH YORK,"My Husband and I lived at [address removed] for 10 years, while saving for a home. It was literally the worst experience I've had renting in my entire life. We had to deal with constant construction that disrupted our sleep EVERY day, the lady two years of living there. Roaches also became a major problem, as they never kept the garbage shoot very clean, so it was just a breeding ground for them. Management was horrible, very condescending and did little to fix situations. Broken fire alarms and or people just setting them off for no reason also disrupted our sleep. Elevators sometimes were not working properly, so you would have super long wait times to get to your unit, I even became stuck in one of their elevators twice. I was traumatized living there. I would recommend this place to no one...It was beyond horrible. We felt like we were living a nightmare."
785,SLEEPWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"Management is quick to action when maintenance concerns are brought to their attention,  fairly priced apartments that are well maintained."
786,FEEL AT HOME,SCARBOROUGH,"FRAUD ALERT!
Do not fall into their trap. They take your ID , work permit and all documents while signing the lease and use misuse these documents to take new water heater/electricity connections for different properties on your name WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. They do not pay for any of these services and later the innocent tenant will be getting bills in their name for services which they are not even aware of. Beware of them!!"
787,KIRSH APARTMENTS (DAVID),SCARBOROUGH,"David is an absolute terror to deal with. He will accost your guests if they're coming to visit. He will take your deliveries (or absolutely scream at the delivery people). The only reason he even has the job is because his Mother owns the building. The building itself is in disgusting disrepair. It is absolutely FULL of mould and cockroaches and they refuse to do anything about it. It's a full blown infestation to the point where we had to keep all kitchen gear/cooking stuff/plates/cutlery all in air tight containers to keep the bugs off. I'd you have a repair you need done... Good luck. We literally had our roof cave in above the absolutely disgusting shower and fill the tub with ceiling refuse covered in black mold. Literally took them months to ""repair"" it which consisted of sparkling over the mold-filled hole. It fell down again within weeks. The parking here is atrocious and they do not care if parking is included in your lease. Landlord has fired or had every single employee quit on them numerous times. No concerns are given about tenant rights, health or safety."
788,JIA,MARKHAM,"The landlord lives together. 
Many students live there, the whole house is full of students, many. 
Strangers often come and out. 
No privacy. 
Very noisy, poor sound insulation. Noise from floors, walls, pipes, students, kids, people talking overnight.
Odd smell. 
Mold. 
Bugs, spiders, mosquitos, unknown flying insects.
Poor meals.
Homestay, rent is high.
Got scammed."
789,BRIAN ALIPOUR,TORONTO,He practiced Discriminating behaviors with all tenants and neighbors.
790,COGIR,OSHAWA,Renovation is very very bad
791,CHARLES/CHARLIE HORVATH,HAMILTON,"This guy is the textbook definition of a bad landlord. The building was broken into multiple times a month due to the back door being broken for OVER A DECADE. Charlie preferred cheap bandaid solutions rather than spending the money to properly fix it, and refused to install security cameras even when the break-ins started occurring to our personal vehicles. He also shared my personal information with my neighbours, misgendering me and revealing to them that myself and my partner are LGBTQ. He keeps the building as cold as he is legally allowed and slacks off on snow removal. When I moved out, he had a new tenant (with a young child) in my unit before my lease was up, before I had even moved all my belongings out or given my key back. Charlie just decided to give my stuff to the new tenant. I never got most of my belongings back."
792,SKYLINE LIVING ,GUELPH,i dont like how they came the assisstant super and two of their employees and more or less violated my home they did not give 24 hours notice to come in and take pictures of my unit as a “scope” they didn’t allow me to remove my personal items
793,"CENTURION PROPERTY , 5249 DUNDAS ST W",ETOBICOKE,"Where do I even begin … moving here my wife and I thought it would be a great place somewhere we could stay at for a few years …. We were wrong … they claim and strongly urge no smoking yet people do it anyways ( cigarettes and weed ) even if the windows and doors are closed somehow you can still smell it coming in. People smoking weed at  the unit above dropping joints or cigarette butts onto my balcony showing management and then only saying sorry we need physical proof it was them smoking otherwise we can not charge them.

Lots of nice people but also a lot of non courteous , rude neighbors blasting music from midnight till 4am with no regard for there neighbours, you can tell management all you want but nothing will be done about it.
I was here for one year and I am glad to be leaving after they think they can raise the rent by $300 a month what a joke"
794,DAVID LENOVER,ST. CATHARINES,"David Lenover charged 3100 for a unit I lived in 
We had a agreement to stop the lease 
And paperwork to prove no money owed 
I moved out on the agreed date 
The downstairs tenant did not and the landlord ruined my credit with front lobby because of it even though we had a agreement 

He threatens , takes pictures of licence plates of vehicles in the driveway 
Shows up unannounced and makes fun of autistic children . He has no care for the children in the home , he called the police for no reason so many times that they would not let him come to the house anymore 

He is a horrible landlord"
795,WESTWOOD HOLDINGS,TORONTO,"These buildings are disgusting. There have been countless building superintendents, property managers and companies in charge of this place literally it can change weekly you get notices of someone new who has come in and they are all useless and some of them are literal criminals with warrants out or straight out of halfway houses. They don’t fix anything here. They updated the electrical because it was more than 100 years old and just placed new wiring on the outside of the walls and left massive holes several feet long inside tenants units opening directly into the inside of the walls that were not repaired, mold and bugs everywhere. These units are so flimsy you can literally hear everything that happens in other units and the tenants are also so disrespectful and constantly loud but the buildings don’t care, main buildings  front doors are open and broken for months on end and homeless people are often found sleeping in the hallways directly in front of tentants doors. Rent is also not stable or controlled - they have illegally raised the rent every year Inclduing the rent freeze year they still sent notices of an increase when should have been 0 and the next year increase was triple the legal limit and it has just kept happening then they send you eviction or arrears notices. Stay away !"
796,CAMBRIDGE KIWANIS VILLAGE HOUSING,CAMBRIDGE,"Landlord is a lazy, and greedy cheapskate who ignores any and every work order I send. Building is totally infested with cockroaches and very little is done about them despite numerous complaints. The infestation is so bad, that they've practically taken over my unit, destroyed my oven, and caused the bathroom fan to stop working. Despite the unit being in clear disrepair, nothing has been done about it despite sending work orders. They're constantly trying to evict us over the stupidest of things, whether it's because my special needs children are being ""too loud"" during their meltdowns, ODSP not paying the right amount and the landlord demands I pay the full rent amount rather than the difference owed, or being blamed for the roach infestation that they've done very little about and are trying to make ME pay for all the renovations and maintenance that is THEIR responsibility to do in the first place. Despite the landlord staring at the security cameras 24/7, he somehow has a problem with me taking out my trash ""one-too-many times"", but not the drug addicts that I've caught about smoke crack in front of the entrance and had to shoo away. During unit inspections, they'll take a photo of my recycling bin having a couple of plastic bottles and call that ""clutter"". Simply put, if the landlord doesn't like you for whatever reason, he makes it very personal and tries to evict you by any means necessary, and even by illegal means.

You know this place is going downhill when they have to merge with a bigger housing company to keep themselves from sinking, AND get a housing official that works for the city of Cambridge to inspect the place, who was called in by the elementary school next door because a roach decided to stowaway in my kid's lunchbag. If you ever have to get into subsidized/community housing, stay as far away from Kiwanis Housing (who are now owned by Satellite Community Homes), as you possibly can, save yourself the trouble of having to deal with people who could care less about anything but themselves and money."
797,IVANNA PRESOT,TORONTO,I forgot to mention she created her own lease agreement and renewal agreement that have a laundry list of illegal things including stuff about my animals. She's also forcing me to leave by a set date that I had to agree to or not renew. Shes kicked every previous tenant out by making them go on a month to month or not renewing or forcing a half year or an end date on the renewal just to up the rent more than legally allowed if it was a renewal
798,IVANNA PRESOT,TORONTO,"I don't even know where to begin the insanity of living in her basement is unjustifiable. She will involve herself in your life and talk to you all the time, she says that her tenants rent a bedroom only, yet she advertised the entire basement, she has literally attempted to call me and tell me, my partner and one friend that I rent a room that I need to be in the room (just a bedroom) she refuses to give rent receipts and advises to use etransfer bank history as proof for taxes (not legit, not even possible), if you play music even from a cellphone shell stop on the ceiling (which is super thin and they are usually always loud) she will come down at 6-7am or 10-12pm and use the central vac right outside my bedroom door (laundry room and vac are right beside my bedroom), she will literally swear, scream, be little, make fun of you in person or via text/email. She always sends texts and emails about the littlest things like telling us to take the garbage out. She's very petty and cheap, fridge door is broken and she says that's how it runs better meanwhile we need to hands to open it. She took away all of our furniture including our kitchen table (it's hers but she advertised the place and showed it to us with all the furniture or else we never woulda rented the place, she does that to keep us out) I was told I can sue her for 6 months of rent worth, I only scratched the surface, but she gives me bad anxiety to even be in this house"
799,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"This has got to be the worst company I have ever dealt with! Run from this company! They purchased our building, with grand delusions of adding 5 luxury units into the side of the building. While taken away our storage and parking spaces. They moved the laundry room, from a heated area, to a non heated area. The common area are in derelict state, paint peeling, holes in floors. They keep, raising rent above the guidelines. When they have done, nothing that's beneficial to us the Tenants. Don't rent from Akelius, run far from!"
800,NICK AND SAARI DARMASAPUTRA,CARRYING PLACE,"Landlord demanded social insurance number, pay stubs, access to house without notice. Also used house for their own personal storage. Had outstanding accounts for heating bills towards the house. Lied about the cost of heating the house."
801,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"We saw a marked decrease in repair and health and safety after this property management company took over our building. Highlights include: Ineffective pest control resuling in long term ( over 6 months) german roach infestations (multiple units/floors).  We have had several security breaches where property has been taken- they have done nothing. It seems likely that the reason is to drive tennants out early for demoviction purposes. They have already applied to rebuild on this lot. During pandemic (when many tennants were exclusively working from home) they started multiple unit demolishments WITHOUT PERMITS to cause extreme noise distress for weeks. They are extremely poor communicators and tennants can expect suprises in general. A minor point: small community initiatives in our building: free item swap area, mini laundry library and holiday door decorations seem to be a preoccupation for this company and well worth their time to trash/ remove or harass tennants about. This company tries to do as little as possible and will gaslight, victim blame and pass the buck.  They are not interested in long-term livability and seem to specialize in clearing the place out early for development."
802,SKYLINE LIVING,BRANTFORD,"My review reflects on Skyline Living, not on any specific Resident Manager. 
I have lived at this location for 5 years as of May 1, 2023. Within that 5 years, I have lived in two different units. First unit was a 1 bedroom, and then we later upgraded to a 2 bedroom. Upon moving into our 2 bedroom apartment, we were signing a lease agreement and for some unknown reason the Resident Manger (at the time) felt it was necessary to assure us that ""there has never been a cockroach issue in that unit, but we exterminated the unit before your move-in date"" - Keep in mind, we didn't ask that question. 
About 3 weeks into living in the new unit, I'd wake up in the middle of the night to get a drink or use the washroom, only to be jumping over cockroach obstacles. I notified the Resident Manager right away, where we were then put on a list for a dusting extermination. This was back in 2021. It is currently 2023, and we are STILL battling the cockroaches. My partner and I both have contacted the Regional Manager of Skyline only for her to brush us off. We have expressed that this is is a building wide issue and that the entire building needs to be exterminated to put this pest issue to rest, but we get told ""it's too expensive"" as a response. We currently pay just shy of $1,800/month PLUS utilities. There are 83 units in the one building alone (there's two buildings on site). Hypothetically speaking, if it costed 10K to have the building exterminated and those 83 units were rented out at $1,600 each, that's a profit of $132,800 MONTHLY in Skylines pocket, but ""it's too expensive"" to exterminate cockroaches so their residents can live comfortably???? Talk about a scam."
803,ALFONZINA GROTTOLA,NIAGARA FALLS,Not attentive to property maintenance or repairs.
804,WILSTAR,TORONTO,"Lots of corruption, They've been doing a bunch of renovations and updates on the building by the same contractors. The contractors are rude, damage suites. Someone in the company has connections because they keep hiring them. They will do a project that takes 1 month and they will take 8 months. They do the worst job, and they keep doing the same work. If you want to live in a building that has a minimum of 5 construction projects and that will last for months, come here. Also avoid them because they are super rude to tenants. They also don’t care about cars in the parking lot. Besides the third party contractors, everything is good. Besides the amenities, pool hours are terrible."
805,MJ DOORS- JAMI JACKLIN,CORUNNA,"Our townhouse complex was purchased by this company just over a year ago.  In that, time offers were made to 2 units for repairs with the agreement our rent would almost double after completion.  Now keep in mind these renovations were actually repairs that were in desperate need of completion.  Our unit agreed. Paperwork was completed based on the work being completed in a timely manner and remember the word “completed”.  Work began in our kitchen the middle of May 2022 and we were told one week to complete everything maximum.  Fast forward 6 weeks later with no kitchen.  A parade of various “workers “ coming at all hours of the day and night.  Some of which we discovered had criminal records when the police showed up and one of them fled our place by jumping the backyard fence and leaving.  By the beginning of July we had a functional kitchen of you call it that.  Not up to much standard but we felt we had no choice to accept this.  Bathroom renovations began in October.  What an ordeal.  Contractors, if you can call them that didn’t bother to show up until late afternoon and completely gutted our bathroom. We were told in order for it to be completed, they would have to stay until the early hours of the morning or they would leave and go back to their office in Windsor and they didn’t know when they would be back. Well common sense would prevail that if your townhouse unit only has one bathroom in it you have no choice but to accept this to the.  To this date April 29/23 our bathroom has still not 100% been completed. The work that was done was not done properly and we have submitted numerous texts and emails to the owner and the maintenance departments none of which have been responded to. We now get threatening emails every month by being issued N4s because we paid our rent but we pay the original lease amount and not the amount that the owner is expecting- when the renovations should have been completed. We have told this person multiple times that we have no problem paying the new amount when the job is done. She refuses to reach out to us by text, email or even phone call and all communication has broke down. This company and this woman have property all over Windsor, Sarnia, Corunna, London, and St. Thomas Ontario.  They have clearly taken on more than they can handle because they don’t deal with anything.  We are reasonable people to get along with, and all we have ever asked for from her in the beginning, was respect and open communication, we’ve given it and not been given it back. Sad that people think this is acceptable. I’m not one to badmouth people by any means, but I’m on here just to make people aware- stay away from this company. Stay away from M J Doors and Jami Jacklin.  Her company’s motto is “ our house, your home”.  What a joke, sadly I hope nobody has to go through what we have gone through this past year."
806,MARK AND LORI TRACHSEL,STRATFORD,They failed to put their hot water heater rental back in their names when we moved out and now reliance wants me to buy it out for 800$ cause they still refuse to put the rental back in their name even tho there's new tenants using it and I haven't lived there in 3 years ..they have refused to even acknowledge that they owe the company either for the buy out or for the past 3 yrs of it's rental use
807,MARK RAYMER,OSHAWA,"He's an excellent landlord. I've lived in quite a few rentals since moving away from home and he is one of the better ones. He respects your privacy, he fixes things crazy fast and he is super nice."
808,SKYLINE LIVING - ELIZABETH YOUNGE,GUELPH,Elizabeth “Liz” is such a kind soul she’ll get out of bed in the middle of the night to help her tenants in any situation! Unfortunately she gets the shit end of the stick because head office doesn’t want to take appropriate action on building and tenant care! Elizabeth is currently injured and skyline is making her do duties that would further increase the injury
809,JASON NACCAROTO NORTHSTAR,SAULT STE. MARIE,My place is infested with mice they run all over the house constantly. Nothing ever gets fixed and I am paying the utilities for the upstairs apt as well as mine.
810,ROBERT CAMPBELL,LONDON,"Does not do repairs unless it becomes critical issue, does not give a rent reciept you have to ask for it many times to get it, interruput tenant peace from time to time, shares tenant private information without thier approval."
811,LISA XIE,VAUGHAN,Major repairs required and Lisa refused to do for over 7 months of lease term until we gave up and moved out
812,MILL CREEK HOLDINGS,CAMBRIDGE,Doesn't do the big repairs needed. We have HUGE pot holes in the parking lot. The driveway has a MAJOR blindspot and it isn't safe. There is only 1 light in the parking area and doesn't feel safe. No wheelchair access.
813,ROSELEEN D'SOUZA AND ROMULUS D'SOUZA,ETOBICOKE,"Overall she is a nice landlord, but she gets very picky when you are moving out and into her property with respect to repairs and any items to check off the rental agreement."
814,PETE MORRONE,WELLAND,Rented from him while I was at Niagara college and was a great experience. If I had an issue he looked at it right away and he always gave notice if he needed to come by.
815,YAN RUY CANG,ANCASTER,"Yan Ruy Kang it’s the most awful human, bad person, bad landlord, don’t renta houses whit her, She is a profiteer who only seeks to bother the poor tenants who inhabit that house now, she raises the rent no matter what, that's just the tip of the iceberg, if you want a quiet life, don't rent with her, do that favor."
816,ROMAN,BOLTON,We have been living in this property for one year now and our landlord was amazing to us. Always available if there was anything to fix. He is respectful and friendly.
817,DOMINIC BRIGANTE,TORONTO,"You have to push for any repairs to be done. Dom and Amy will not clean or paint your unit before you move in. Maintenance of shared spaces such as sweeping hallways is done by tenants without any rent rebates. Dom and Amy do not come to their property, most of the tenants have never met them in person. Dom will text and call you to help out in building without any rent rebate.

The lease you sign has illegal items on it such as ""not using too much hot water"", ""no pets"" and ""post dated cheques"". Not horrible landlords, they just do the bare minimum and assume tenants are not aware of their rights or the legal responsibilities they have has landlords."
818,MIKE MENARD,CHELMSFORD,The man served me an n12 on the summer during the height of covid because I contested having full use of the back yard as we were told when we moved in that the back yard was for the top units exclusive use. So I had a whole play ground in my back yard that he all off sudden wanted me tp share it with the new ppl that moved into the basement apt. When I refused and reminded him we have exclusive use of the back yard. And if he wanted us to share it we would need rent lowered as I was losing an amenity. Served fought and WON the first n12. Found a  ew place before the second one went to hearing.
819,RWC MANAGEMENT,TIMMINS,"Posting entrance notices at 11pm labelled for 48 hours after 6am that morning.
Immediately started raising rent.
Failed to find a solution to a heating problem they knew about before renting a unit.
Charging over double the value of most units
Disclosing laundry rooms as bedrooms.
Absolutely no discretion when choosing tenants.
Attempts to claim fees illegal in Canada not just Ontario (but those as well).
Owner has never seen the building only property managers have.
Does not maintain lawns (local requirement)
Did not check smoke detectors on purchase of in the YEAR since.
Has not provided existing tenants with lease agreements."
820,SHARON LEON,OTTAWA,"This is Ottawa Rooms rooming houses in Centretown and all their buildings and units are completly infested with cocraches, bedbugs and mice!! Bugs have ruined all of my belongings that I've had to throw out. The management and maintenance is DEPLORABLE. They are a private owened business so they think they can get away with anything/everything. They do not care about their tenants or buildings! This was by far the absolute worst place I've ever rented from in my life!"
821,EREN & SUSAN YUKSEL,OAKVILLE,"This was one house that I truly loved. Due to covid and personal life crisis, the rent was delayed but never not paid. I got an extension to live before the term was ending. But then they forced us saying they have to sell. Please keep in mind they have 7 more properties in and around Oakville. I felt used. My daughter was on a medical trial and they had showings throughout which we fully accommodated them for. This was peak of Covid. I strongly feel that this was a discriminatory action to get us out of the house. Our privacy was invaded because he’d drive in our street and then send an email to cut the grass or pointing out other things which felt really weird. I don’t know if I can use this and go in for a legal action.  Been 2 years but I know what they intended."
822,RAJASRI THURAIRAJAH,MARKHAM,"At first we dealt with a Property Management company that showed the house and it all seemed ok.  However, by the next month, the Landlord stopped using the Property Management company and we were told that we were to deal directly with the Landlord.  He seemed ok at first, but, when we noticed that he lied about our Enbridge, Hyrdro and water bills and let him know that he had purposely deceived us, he didn’t apologize or claim that he made an error.  That was just the beginning of the horrific ordeal that we experienced with this Landlord.  We had to ask over and over again to have items fixed which were very essential to having a safe living environment.  I mean, what doesn’t someone understand when it is the winter and the furnace isn’t working? How many times does someone have to ask to have a toilet replaced because it doesn’t work? These are basic and essential to living in a safe environment.  Not to mention the rats that were in our backyard, ants everywhere in the house, bugs in the basement, wiring and breaker boards that had not been kept up properly, window screens that were either non-existent or in need of replacing, and many more issues that shows that this Landlord should be never allowed to rent to anyone ever again!  How about  The final showing up unannounced at the house and demanding to be let in so he could “check out” the premises and then hand us a N11 and demand that we sign it or he wouldn’t leave!!!!  When we wouldn’t sign this bogus N11 he freaked out and we told him to leave or we would call the police.  The Landlord also tried to evict us by giving us a N13 saying that he needed us to leave the premises because he was putting the house up for sale and that he needed to do renovations and fix it up in order to sell.  Finally, the Landlord hired a Paralegal to his dirty work.  When we were informed that the Landlord wanted to come and “inspect” the premises again, even though he was at the premises 2 weeks before, we were informed that the Landlord would be changing the locks because he didn’t like our reply!!!!  This is illegal when the tenant is currently occupying the rental house.  We informed the Paralegal as such but it took over 2 days for the Paralegal to get the picture when we informed him that if the Landlord comes and changes the locks we would call the police.  All this stress took a toll on our mental health along with the constant harassment and threats.  We ended up moving out. Even after we moved out and some mail came that we wanted to pick up, we asked the Paralegal if we could come an pick it up.   The Paralegal, on behalf of the Landlord, demanded that we pay and that we give him our new address and other personal information in order for the Landlord to give us our mail.  We had to file a complaint to the police and it was only after the police contacted the Paralegal that we were able to get our mail.  order for us to get our mail. DO NOT EVER rent any house or whatever else that has anything to do with this Landlord.  As well, this Landlord has several other names that he goes by as well as the one that is listed on this rating, one being Ketha and another one is Sinnappu Ketha.  We have no idea what this Landlord’s real name is but be aware and steer clear of this person. This whole experience turned out to be an utter nightmare.  Finally, we urge every tenant to make themselves knowledgeable about their rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act of Ontario and to read and question everything that a potential or current Landlord asks you to sign or enter into an agreement with because unfortunately, you can never be too careful in protecting yourself and your rights as a tenant."
823,YUSHIH CHOU,OAKVILLE,We have been going through challenges but our landlord has been very considerate and has been unlike the usual landlords. His property manager Eric is a great person.
824,SIGNET GROUP,MISSISSAUGA,28 Helene St n is a dump.  Avoid.
825,JUSTIN BARLETTA,ST CATHARINES,"Made us pay for half a new furnace because we wanted to use the a/c when we first moved in. Numerous gas leaks, mold and many other dangerous issues he refused to fix."
826,PRISMA,WHITBY,"Property manager is controlling , manipulative, micromanaging, lying , sneaky, bullying , . Just nope"
827,TINA PANAGOULIA,TORONTO,"Reasonable landlord for the most part, but rating lowered because of aggressive rent increases."
828,GATEHOUSE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Not quite slumlord, not quite NOT a slumlord. They will do a crappy to average level repair for any urgent issues, usually in good time, sometimes not. For example, they fixed a leak within a few days, a broken faucet within 1 month, and took 2 months to fix a broken heater in November/December with no rent relief or space heaters provided. The owner Ralph Draws is very disrespectful over e-mails, and seems to be especially rude to women."
829,DON SHANK,STURGEON FALLS,Only complaint we would have is the landlords lack of respect for their tenants parking privileges
830,PARK PROPERTY,SCARBOROUGH,The office people who work are not very polite and are usually harsh with the clients
831,VISTA LOCAL,OTTAWA,I feel very disappointed on the treatment. As a woman of colour I was rejected to rent an apartment from vista local. Apparently I make extremely great money and I have an amazing credit but still I do not meet Vista Local’s criteria.
832,ANN MAURINE,TORONTO,"The landlord - Anne - didnt mention that her parents were living with her. When i moved in, she told me that they are here for vacation and will leave soon. But they never left. Her mom used to enter my room whenever i was at work (as one day i saw her doing that when i came back). Above all, the worst thing she did was keep the house temperature less than 21° (legal requirement during winters) to save on hydro. I requested her twice but she never increased the temperature. Its only when i fell sick and told her that i’d call 311, she increased the temp to 23. NO PRIVACY AND SPACE IN THIS HOUSE."
833,NORTHEDGE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT 25 MABELLE,TORONTO,"The building used to be decent but has gone downhill quickly.  There are roaches, mice, rats, mould, etc.  Add to that the fact they tried to evict all the tenants from the underground parking over a year ago and they are still trying to get people out so they can take the garage and the tiny greenspace we have, cutting down all sorts of protected trees, to  make another high priced condo.  The owner of our building IS the management company.  Her husband is the Director of Housing Policy for Doug Ford's government.   Its the only reason that this new build is happening.
We get plenty of notices from mgmt for access and in at least 50% of the cases, nobody ever shows up.  What they do show up and do is always subpar.
If you move in, do so knowing there is NO tenant parking for new people.  Even current tenants don't necessarily have parking.  Additionally, most all the visitor parking is used by tenants.
You can't even go to the office anymore as they are closed to tenants.  You have to go through the security guards for everything."
834,CHIN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,Daniel is the best landlord we ever had.
835,KUMUTHINI PARAMANATHAN,OTTAWA,Cheap landlords
836,KAYMIC DEVELOPMENT LIMITED,GREATER SUDBURY,"This building at 263 Brady is getting worst by the day. Once upon a time it was an awesome building, well maintained in the early 2000s. Seems like since the 2008 recession it’s only going down hill. Many good things were taken away including, food bank, annual Christmas dinner, a swimming pool, a locked hose to wash cars, picnic tables to hang out in the sun, … . Employees including security guards are often rude to most of the tenants. Garbage bin pick up occurs as early as 5am. Waking everyone up with all the bangings."
837,GREENWIN INC,TORONTO,"The insane amounts of unnecessary reasons for entering our apartments is insane. I have a stack of ""24-hour entry notice"" papers that is nearing a foot tall, over 3 years. They come onto each floor, open up every apartment whether home or not, and have one ""security"" man to look over everything. The ""repair men"" are not knowledgeable in their crafts, every single time leaving the apartment in worse condition than it was before. Leaving large holes in the walls that go unfinished, smashing sinks, doors and never returning to repair. Mice and bugs get in with every new hole. If they do attempt to repair a cut out hole in the wall, it will leak spray foam and just fall apart a little more every day. They paint the walls of graffiti, but do nothing to deter the addicts gaining entry and making a wild mess of things. It's unsafe. There's no peace. I dream of the day when I get out of here. Incessant demands for financial checks, threatening eviction once every 6 months. It's too much. Much better ways to spend landlord money then repainting the hallways yellow every so often."
838,WESTDALE,TORONTO,"Avoid them if you do not want cigarette smoke in your apartment. The building I rented in was billed as non-smoking. The super assured me when I went to see the place that there had never been an issue with cigarette smoke. Once I moved in I found out that this was not true and that many tenants had reported having problems with cigarette smoke in their unit. The A/C and the supplementary heat were unusable because it piped in cigarette smoke from smokers who are in the building from before it went 'non-smoking'.

Also the office manager is known to give people who work from home a hard time. She is an obstructive bully and if you go over her head to head office you will be met with further resistance from her superior.  I understand that tenants have left Westdale because of bullying from these two individuals. 

The front desk staff gossips about the tenants. You can do better."
839,THE ROYAL FLATS,GUELPH,Great Building Manager! Very friendly and beyond helpful.
840,"CHELSEA, KASIA BONDY",WINDSOR,"Chelsea Bondy and her mother Kasia Bondy are some of the worst landlords out there. They installed cameras all around the house after I moved in, including a hidden one in the laundry room. (To catch me changing) They are deranged and enjoy harassing their tenants. Chelsea who is a vet tried to poison my dog. Kasia assaulted me after her and her daughter broke into my house. They also charged me 2/3 utilities and would turn the hot water tank way down, shut off the heat in the winter(locked out bc they have google nest), and would unplug the washing machine while I was using it. Don’t rent from 1510 parent ave Windsor Ontario."
841,WESTWOOD HOLDINGS - LIFE ON QUEEN,TORONTO,"I've lost count of how many property managers and staff these buildings have turned over in the last 5 years. This place is infested with mice and bugs. The building will only do what is required to appease by-law. Everything is falling apart and all they do band-aid fixes, and you will have to fight like hell to get those. The superintendent, Mike, harasses and screams at tenants. The building refuses to take responsibility for tenants. They have a lot of sketchy tenants and tell you there's nothing they can do and to call the police if your neighbor is threatening you. They don't give you proper notice of entry or follow the laws. The buildings aren't cleaned regularly. If you try to get any of these things addressed you'll get harassed and they'll try to force you out. These buildings aren't safe. The police are here regularly."
842,EFFORT TRUST,HAMILTON,Great place . Always clean . Safe building
843,ATK,KITCHENER,"Ethical, considerate, fair and easy. An absolute pleasure to rent from."
844,MUHAMMAD AND MUNZA AKRAM,TORONTO,"Landlord was unable to complete repairs (over a month), required me to take off work to fulfill service calls, insisted on 4 months advance of rent, did not respect privacy and refused additional fob. Would not recommend."
845,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"6.5 years at Innes Park. 2016-2023
Hasn't been the worst experience, current landlord also not the worst but not the best. Have to push to get certain repairs done. Windows are a disaster. Lots of the repairs done are cheaply done, Bandaid fixes. Had major ant issues summer and fall 2022 - landlord ignored at first telling tenants it was their fault, clean better. Never had any issues in 6 years, only when they do cleaning/repairs of outside of building there becomes a problem. Rumors of bed bugs. 
Many tenants with dogs are ignorant owners - don't consider others around them and don't pick up poop, some take their dogs to parking garage to do their business. One REALLY annoying tenant in 102-2767 very loud daily and very nosey in everyone's business.
Office assistant has been the same for YEARS. Sweet kind lady(Olga)Best part of this property from Paramount. Building management has daily cleaning of all floors done however a few things that could be better - laundry rooms seem to get highly ignored for cleaning. Frustrating the cleaners put elevator on hold while cleaning floors especially during the morning when everyone is going for work or taking dogs out, would be great to see them wait for an elevator to come back instead of holding one of the two elevators.
Landlord has also put a lot of money into upgrading their office to a nice modern-day look, even adding a back deck from their office... Would have been nice to see as much effort into the over-priced apartments that look like they're from the 70s still."
846,STONERIDGE,OSHAWA,They are constantly operating in the grey area of the law and always claiming to be the middle man to the actual property owners. They started out taking advantage of young people in student housing so they fail to realize that these are peoples homes and they are jeopardizing people’s families!!! I don’t know how they sleep at night
847,KIM LACKIE,BURLINGTON,"I've never met a more kind, caring, busy and all around amazing woman in Kim as she manages Park Property in Burlington. I sometimes can't believe how well she keeps it together and keeps all us tenants very happy. Bravo Kim!"
848,RESREIT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,The on site management office have  constantly changing personnel who are unable to answer any questions.  You cannot make an appointment with the property manager.  Nor can you email him as previous staff emails change to a generic one for all to see. One staff member admitted they do not rebate the interest on the one month deposit unless the tenant asks for it.
849,PETER BONNICI AND DOMENICA CARAVETTA,TORONTO,They do not maintain anything in the units and we have developed health conditions due to the mold in the unit when we lived there. They harassed us continually and tried to overcharge for repairs and pocket the difference. Literally do anything you can to not live in any of their residences.
850,LUCY AND JOHN SPEZZANO,MISSISSAUGA,Just terrible people. Don't engage in business with them.
851,ANTHONY DEFAZIO,VAUGHAN,"Very kind, responsible and fair landlord!"
852,MORGURAD  NAR CANADA L.P,EAST YORK,"Worst management I have ever seen. Noisy building, neighbors are not warned at all about the silence, orderliness and cleanliness of the corridors of the apartment. There is a constant  bad smell and occupation in the corridors of the apartment. The stairs cannot be used because they are too dirty and there is lots of garbage. The management only asks the tenants for rent and does not care about cleaning the building at all. The air conditioning does not work and one or two elevators are always broken. Especially in the summer season this building smells bad and there is always garbage in area of this building, I would never recommend 43 Thorncliffe Park drive to anyone because the management only takes money and does not care about the cleanliness of the building, it should be noted that they do not sweep the corridors of the apartments even for a month."

856,BAHRAM MOGHADDAM,TORONTO,"Bahram is a good enough person but a terrible landlord. He doesn’t seem to care about the safety of his tenants or his property being kept clean. The oven does not work and he did not share that before signing the lease. There are two mentally deranged people living in the home and one is his cousin. He refuses to be a landlord. I experienced many injustices in his house, including human fecal matter inside my shoes."
857,SHIN-NAE BYUN,TORONTO,**********
858,CAPREIT,TORONTO,This complex is like living in housing. It's dirty. A lot of drug dealers. They don't think of the tenants problems. Capreit is the worst place to rent from. I believe they only want the rent money. They think it's condos but it's far from it. Cockroaches. Bed bugs. They can't get rid of it. Parking sucks etc etc. So much wrong with this place. Help someone who cares . please help
859,GREENWIN,NORTH YORK,Worst landlords in the market I would never ever recommend anyone to live here not even a roach
860,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,The worst . 11 units never no hot water cause crack head likes to keep shower running been reported nothing. Another tenant living with hole-in bathroom ceiling and another using washroom in buckets in apartment and has apartment destroyed and other tenants have to suffer
861,CHRIS AND CHRISSY THOMPSON,MISSISSAUGA,"The landlords of 36 Cumberland Drive Mississauga are disrespectful, negligent, and lie in almost every interaction with their tenants. For several years until LTB order encouraged action they had no annual fire/life safety inspections, landscaping or snow removal. They abandoned their property during the pandemic to sail in the Caribbean with no in-town support. They are never around so privacy is good unless they are sending uninsured and unqualified persons to make bandaid repairs months after requests. Zero sound proofing so all hear every conversation the neighbors have. Great area. Great neighbors with the exception of one cocain addict who would have questionable late night company at his apartment all night keeping the other tenants up all night."
862,ALINA JAWAID,TORONTO,Great Landlord
863,MUSLEM MUSLEM,MISSISSAUGA,"I currently reside in an apartment 607-2542 Argyle Rd , Mississauga 
owned by a friend of mine. However, he has not fulfilled his obligations as a landlord by neglecting to repair the kitchen and dishwasher. Additionally, he had promised me a minimum three-year lease, which I trusted and consequently signed a one-year contract. To my dismay, he offered the apartment for sale only two months after I moved in. Prior to this, I had a comfortable living situation with a landlord who never caused any issues. My friend, the current owner of the apartment, had contacted me on multiple occasions, encouraging me to move in, which I eventually did, resulting in the situation I am currently facing."
864,BENI COLAILLIO,HAMILTON,"This landlord is horrible, everything from removing the door off of a senior tenants unit, to breaking into tenant apartments and stealing court documents or taking pictures of personal property to later utilize against them. He has also assaulted or threatened life on tenants. Takes forever to repair anything, black mold in units and he just says to clean it with bleach  he is currently in the process of renovicting many tenants so that he can then transform the building into Air Bnb units. Locked out buzzer system out .... etc etc. This list goes on amd on with him avoid this landlord like the plague"
865,JULIA LEUNG,WATERLOO,"Landlord acted fairly cooperative and polite initially, but did a complete flip when we did not follow her (illegal) requests. She added unenforceable clauses to the lease that she only removed once they were pointed out. She refused to give proper notice for coming to the property, took her time responding to important emails, and was very hostile in every communication, demanding we follow house rules that were not enforceable and making many empty threats. Luckily, she lives out of town so most of the time there was minimal contact. She had local handymen come to the house for any repairs and only occasionally visited the property herself. If you decide to rent from her, make sure you know Ontario rental laws and your rights as a tenant, but don't let her find out until necessary as she tries to take advantage of tenants who don't know better."
866,FAIZA AND USMAN AHMAD,VAUGHAN,"Living in this basement was a nightmare! I wasn’t even there for a full year although we had a lease for a years time. We ended up moving out earlier. 
These landlords were constantly wanting to come in to our unit for example saying they wanted to check the unit every 6 months which i understand that a yearly check maybe would be reasonable as  we are two grown calm adults not distorting everything and I know that these checks are done to make sure everything is in order  but this was brought up AFTER we had moved in and not prior or mentioned on the contract. The landlords started complaining that our GARBAGE which was kept in the garage as was another tenants and the landlords garbage but for some reason it was OUR garbage that smelt as if garbage is not suppose to smell. 
(The landlords 2 lived upstairs with their mother 1 and three to four children) in the basement they had two units with my husband and I in one and another gentlemen’s in the other. 
The house started smelling like weed sometimes while we were living there and the landlords were adamant it was one of the two units down stairs because it smelt like it was coming from downstairs but part of the basement was also not accessible from downstairs but was from upstairs and was a space the landlords and their kids used. The wall between that basement space was shared with our unit and we can hear everything down when they came. The daughter would come down a lot and pretend to work out as she would tell her parents but I was able to smell the weed at that time. It was her daughter smoking in the house not any of the downstairs tenants. 
These landlords proceeded to install cameras inside the house when you come in through the side door which was the downstairs tenant main entrance. Mind you they did not have cameras outside the house. Living in this house felt like we were constantly being controlled and some ridiculous issues were always coming up (being made up by the landlord) even though we were following the rules set out on the contract and we’re NEVER not once late on rent or anything. We ended up breaking the contract as living here was literally affecting my mental health. We ended up leaving at the beginning of the month but left the entire of the month paid because that’s how desperate we were to leave this horrible house!"
867,GREG CHITILLIAN,MARKHAM,Our landlord has zero respect for anything or anyone. He shows up when he wants without notice. He has also provided his laborer with a key to utilize the washroom in the basement even though neither of them live in the house which breaks every law possible.
868,SEAN,NORTH YORK,"Although the house is not in good conditions, he is a nice person in general. My greatest concern is the maintainancr and hygiene. I think he must either think of a way to clean the common areas or should have a solid agreement with other tenant that keep the common areas as dirty as they possibly can."
869,ROD JONES,BROCKVILLE,One of the best landlords I've had the pleasure of dealing with
870,TOBY MARKOWITZ,HAMILTON,Toby is the worst landlord he doesnt care about his tenants let alone families hes a bully. He threatens his tenants calls them names he has so many police reports on him
871,NADEEM AFTAB,ETOBICOKE,Overpriced rental
872,SLEEPWELL MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,THE WORST. Still had a week left to move out and they had a crew in for repairs and painting and they stole so many of my personal belongings. Contacts given for communicating concerns were impossible to get a hold of.
873,QUEENIE TANG,TORONTO,"My landlord every year asked for 20-35% rent increase!
In the second year, I moved out of the unit! And her unit was empty for 2 months. So, now, overall, she is making less money than what paid her! 
Thanks Karma"
874,ANGIE FIEVOLI,LONDON,"Angie Fievoli is the best landlord I've had. She is considerate, kind, and accomodating."
875,SHORELINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MIDLAND,"Horrible service with no communication. We had no hot water for 6 days and we had to chase them every day for answers. They didn’t even tell us when it was fixed. 
Also took them 6 days to turn in heat after requested, a month after legally being required to. 
They also let the new tenant smoke at the doorway, walk right outside our bedroom windows and steal our parking spot just to park her car that didn’t run there."
876,MIGUEL QUENNEVILLE,OTTAWA,"I’ve been renting a room from Miguel for a while now. Repairs any issues we have in the house, respectful, understanding and is fair when it comes to being a little behind on rent. He provided me with a full size fridge of my own when I moved in which is most of what I can say for most places offering room rentals.  He keeps the house clean on a bi weekly basis as he has a cleaner who cleans the common areas such as kitchen living room."
877,ACCOMMOD8U,WATERLOO,"Worst landlord ever. Worst Building Management ever. They will be sweet and polite till you sign the lease. Once you have signed the lease, they don’t care about you. Their Parking Management is fucked up. Rent somewhere else even if its a bit expensive but don’t rent at this management"
878,"QING YAN LIU, DOUG TATE",OTTAWA,"Older couple owns a house and targets students/young people to move in so they can take advantage of them. Had continuous issues for the time we lived there with the heat and plumbing and the landlords would refuse to hire professionals. instead, they would come in, turn some knobs on the heaters and use it as an excuse to walk around all through the house and leave it in the same state. Any issues we brought up would be deflected onto us and met with defensiveness. They didn’t respect boundaries or privacy, would consistently show up and try to let themselves in unannounced. Multiple times doug would come in for “repairs” with his shoes on and just sit in our beds. Really wouldn’t recommend living here."
879,MATHEW,ORILLIA,Amazing
880,BRUCE CUPSKEY,STRATFORD,"He is a very violent, unstable and aggressive landlord. He has assaulted and threatened us several times. He also has broken our things. We have lived in our unit for 6 years and he has tried evicting us every year despite us paying our rent on time. He has broken into our unit and also damaged our items several times. He left us without heat and hot water quite often over the years. The repairs on the unit got so bad that bylaw enforcement stepped in to repair items. We had no stove for 3 years. We also had rodents in our unit for a long time."
881,SHERRY HALSTED,HAMILTON,My Landlord is amazing. They have been great. They reactive to every situation of things that need repair or fixing. I can’t say enough for their professional interaction with us. I have no issues with them. Happy

886,COGIR,EAST YORK,"Poor landlords. The office managers are never in the office, never answer phone calls, and don’t respond to emails. When you are finally able to speak with someone, they are very unprofessional. They don’t respect the tenants and it shows."
887,HEATHER AND PAUL O'DOHERTY,NEWMARKET,Absolutely the worst landlords. Extremely disrespectful. Do not adhere to BASIC rules all landlords should know ... like entering a tenants unit without consent or notice. The unit they managed below me was constantly texting to ask if they went into his apartment while he was at work. They will also try to use their tenants as scapegoats for their poor behavior - in turn causing animosity between tenants. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM.
888,ACCOMMOD8U,WATERLOO,I promise you will be regret to rent home from Accommod8u.
889,ANTONIO DOS SANTOS,YORK,"Well, other then being at the property very ofter because he has a garden in the backyard and evicted me and my family because he wanted to rase the rent but without a notice or a letter he is okay and fix the house any time is necessary"
890,CENTRAL VIEWS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CAMBRIDGE,"Omar Kaake owns and runs this business. He harassed tenants and helps his client Henry Walser deliver illegal n13s.

They ignore repair requests, steal electricity from tenants, and give no notice before they want access to rentals"
891,MINTO,OTTAWA,Most difficult corporation to rent from! It took over a year of asking to get things fixed and they still hadn't by the time we moved. We were there 6 years and the upstairs bathroom window was never fixed and to top it all off they're trying to charge us for floor damage that was done because of a leaky roof they were fixing. My neighbor at the time had the ceiling cave in in one room with how bad it was. Just overall not a good experience
892,JAKUB KOSS,WOODSTOCK,"Dangerously neglectful, disrespectful, greedy, yet horrible with finances. Inexperienced, predatory."

895,DMS,BARRIE,"Horrible building, falling apart, numerous floods over last seven years. Water is often rusty and poor quality to drink. The pool and hot tub have health issues. The Management have questionable morales. Do not live here."
896,BENTALL GREEN OAK,HAMILTON,"This multi billion dollar company is the worst.  Elevators ate always down, hallways flooded because pipes constantly burst and they won't update anything.  Heat is never on, it's freezing in the winter.  Cleaners are a joke.  Cars are constantly broken into in the ""secure"" underground parking"
897,BARHYDTE AND HOLDINGS,ORANGEVILLE,"Considering that without notice, they aren't allowed to go in the dwelling, last month, they were always there. Repairs are a joke and the utilities are a robbery. All that's promised to be included, isn't. Be aware."
898,DAVE BASSI,BRAMPTON,Only wants to collect the rent but not maintain the building
899,MUHAMMAD F KHAN,BRAMPTON,"This landlord will have a key to the community mail box and take your mail, and open your mailbox. Didn’t fix the windows or doors. Our cat caught max 22 mice. We also had leaks in the furnace where the wires were. 
When you call the landlord to deal with the issues he would Ignore the issues."
900,RANEE MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"One of the greediest landlords in Toronto, Rent keeps on increasing but nothing changes in the building, if indeed it doesn't deteriorate.... the place crawls with roaches... they'd go slow on your maintenance requests, I have submitted many and had to submit again and again so they'd do the work , I have like 9 months since I moved in and my buzzer is still not fixed. But would they miss on the increase note (90 days before the increase) Oh no, they won't! and they do dare to  post a board outside saying ""luxury Renovated suites"" the sheer lie! the gumption! the audacity! THESE ARE NOT LUXURIOUS! Apartments are painted with a cheap new beige paint whenever an apartment is vacant .... the work in the bathroom is just so bad, old toilet seat that doesn't flush properly. and certainly THESE ARE NOWHERE NEAR SUITES! these apartment are the basic minimum for the amount tenants are paying... THE BASIC MINIMUM!"
901,AHTI TOVANEN,THUNDER BAY,"Lived with my landlord in a room in a shared home.  It was a bit of an odd situation where he would randomly add other tenants to the house on a temporary or permanent basis without telling us.  At one point a bunch of Tibetan monks lived with us for a few weeks.  Another time a homeless guy moved in rent free.

Overall the landlord was a nice person and very accommodating, but the rental arrangement was strange."
902,NOOR JAHAN,MARKHAM,good
903,GHOLAM (MARCEL) SANAADI,RICHMOND HILL,"Marcel was an excellent landlord. Very kind and helpful, and he always repaired things in a timely manner."
904,SCHEMBRI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,"Please do not rent from them. I lived in a Schembri run property for two years. All rent was auto-transferred at the first of the month. The rental company didn’t take out one of my rents in the middle of summer and I didn’t realize as it was automatically taken out. Instead of telling me that I missed a payment, they took me to collections 2 years later and I paid through the nose for a mistake they made. Be careful out there!"
905,DMS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"When DMS first took over the building they avoided necessary repairs, did mot communicate and were plain disrespectful. Requests were ignored, broken heating was not fixed. It was only after the buildings tenants formed a committee that any of the necessary work got done. The actual building staff do their best but seem to be unsupported by the company’s higher-ups."
906,SLEEPWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"Sleepwell has failed to maintain this property at all. The rent keeps increasing, but they continue to fail to perform repairs or manage the worsening roach situation. At one point in the summer of 2021, a car drove through the front window of the ground floor tenant at this property (obviously not the landlord's fault), but after simply covering the broken window with plywood boards, Sleepwell didn't actually replace the window until November! The poor guy's apartment was freezing cold by late September, and the landlord's only response to his complaints was to provide him with a small space heater and assurances that ""the window would be replaced soon"". The window was delivered and stored in the back hallway for weeks before they had contractors in to replace it!
While I lived in this building, a roach infestation took hold, and I moved out after two months of inaction to do anything about the dozens of roaches that would swarm through my apartment every time I'd walk through. Apparently there is a hoarder living in the basement apartment next door to the car accident unit.. My old neighbor said that they have started roach treatment finally, but that he has to vacate his unit on a biweeky basis for this with his daughter and his cat - and the roaches are still out of control! Sleepwell have offered no compensation for this, and his life is a living hell. I would not recommend their Vanier units on Blake, and based on my experiences, wouldn't recommend Sleepwell in general."
907,CAROL DIAS,HAMILTON,Both Carol and her husband were great. Always fixed things promptly.
908,FIRM CAPITAL,TORONTO,"It's a shame that Firm Capital is not taking a more engaged approach at this property, as the apartments themselves are lovely.  It could be a great place to live, but they only do the very bare minimum that they have to, and sometimes not even that. The owner is notoriously arrogant and difficult. I've only been here two years and we have gone through three superintendents in that time, each one lasting less than a month, so we live without anyone available who is in charge of the building. They have pulled out trees, stripped the back garden of foliage and somehow transferred the parking lot to a new ownership which left everyone in confusion and the parking fees doubled over night. Communication is terrible, and the office makes significant mistakes all the time. If they find a wreath on your door they throw it out."
909,DEAK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTOIS,Dirty smelly mice bugs garbage poop and pee from dogs all over landlady is a gossip plays favorite with tenants and ignores others. Ghetto building. Bandaids everywhere but landlord harasses for money for luxury car payments.
910,PANORAMIC PROPERTIES,SUDBURY,"Terrible, terrible management. Every time I submit a maintenance request they say ""oh yeah, we'll get to that when you move out"", they've been slowly gutting every unit and rerenovating them as people move out, understandable as our unit is quite dated, but we have been here over 10 YEARS. The paint in the bathroom is peeling, the countertop is sagging, the faucet at the back of the counter is held in 100% by solicone because it's deteriorated. Missing a layer of sliding windows.  1 of the 3 radiators doesn't work. Balcony door is drafty. These are ALL things I've been told ""will be done when  you move out"".
Sure, if you have a ""real issue"" like water not running they'll come fix it, but they absolutely refuse to work on anything else in my unit or give us a unit transfer to a new one at the same price. They want us to pay a few hundred more, or continue living in this degregated unit. 
During the yearly inspection the superintendant came and took photos of all the ""damage"" I've previously put in requests for, then tried to submit an eviction notice claiming it was us to cause all of those issues. I pointed out that the last page of the eviction wasn't filled out by the LTB and requested it to be filed properly and they never tried to evict us again. Absolutely terrible, no respect for long term existing tenants, they just want us out to make a few hundred more a month. We're not going ANYWHERE."
911,BOLESLAW KOLODZIEJ,HAMILTON,Took a security deposit and kept it. Ignored all communication asking for the security deposit back.
912,BRIARLANE,TORONTO,"The company doesn’t care about the tenants, they want to demolish the building where I live with my kids to build condos 
They raised my rent last year $22.80 per month but this year the rent was raised $49 per month ! Which is crazy !!
There is no chute for the garbage in my building and it makes it hard to throw it as the building superintendent is like making surveillance of all what we throw he is 90٪؜ of the time next to the garbage area that he can see from the office and makes unpleasant comments.."
913,AMIR DAWOUDI,OTTAWA,"The worst landlord I have ever had the misfortune of renting from. Amir is a bully with control issues. If you don't ask anything from him and say yes to every request he makes, no matter how inane or unreasonable, then you'll get along fine. However, if you remind him of his legal duties as a landlord, or push back when he attempts to use his position to intimidate you, he will quickly lose his temper. He does not want to invest a single cent into his property, leaving windows cracked and moldy, bathroom tiles loose, paint peeling, and countertops in poor condition. The apartment is not well insulated and the windows are old and drafty, resulting in an average indoor temperature of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius during the winter. Rent was quite affordable considering the size and location of the apartment however the building is owner-occupied, resulting in unescapable negativity."
914,BOARDWALK,LONDON,"I live at the Bristol in London on. It’s not a bad place no bugs which is rare in London. The only down side is some of the people they let in are pretty rough and sometimes it takes forever to get something replaced or repaired. I also think the property rental price is atrocious, $1700+ for a two bedroom that’s 884 square feet is an insane price."
915,AMIN EL SHERIF,MISSISSAUGA,"I rented from this low life and his wife for a few years. Where to start 
First of all they changed the terms of the agreement to suit themselves whenever they felt like it. They lived upstairs and I rented the basement and the door in between would only lock from their side. When they wanted ti they just walked in and came into my home on many many occasions. The kitchen was totally out of code and the kitchen cabinets were so close to the ceiling that they actually caught fire on the pot light. 
They never helped me shovel the way into the basement and refused to cover the stairs so I was constantly shoveling upwards. They told me that my children couldn’t go in the backyard and all but that is how we walked into the apartment. I had two parking spots and one day came home to find a boat parked in my spot and was told it was no longer my spot 
The list goes on and on. 
Please be careful whom you rent from"
916,VALMOR GARCIA,TORONTO,Lied to tenants and evicted them in N13 after misleading and ensuring they had no where else to go to secure his mortgage. Underscore Arts and Cry baby gallery used to be someone’s home. Never ever give them your money.
917,PEEL LIVING,MISSISSAUGA,"There is no maintenance at all in the units, they will only fix stuff when we tell them and then the superintendent will say that next time we would be charged for it. They don't care if you are on disability or not they will evict you if you don't have your home within their standards but yet they haven't done any real maintenance to the unit and expect you to keep it to standards. Their standards for their units are not all the same and some people can do whatever they want and won't get target it but if you are a single disabled mother they won't stop harassing you until they make you leave.  No sympathy for the tenants at all and this is run by the government which makes it worse."
918,MOHAMMAD GHOSI,RICHMONDHILL,"Mohammad Ghosi refused to meet his obligations as a landlord, he was harassing us constantly and would call the police every time he wanted to come check the house, shady character.Stay away from him and his wife Irandukht Hassanpour and their partner Mahshad Mahrabian."
919,SKYVIEW LIVING,HAMILTON,"For the four years I lived there, there was a constant cockroach, and eventually bed bug problem. They hire a budget exterminator, who doesn't do a thorough job, just so that they can write that they took care of the problem.

The maximum amount of time they give you for notice on anything is 24 hours. Even if you're doing a bed bug prep, it's only ever 24 hours. They have entered my apartment without providing notice before. I was told to just, ""Call management and complain"". They are constantly looking for excuses to intrude into your apartment. There is zero privacy in that building.

In addition to pests, there is a big black mold problem that they never fix. If you ever want to notify management about anything, you have to directly speak to the superintendent Mike. He refuses to do any correspondence through email or through text. It all has to be in person, verbally. He doesn't want a record of any interactions on paper, in case he gets brought to the landlord tenant board, he doesn't want anyone having any proof of any of the things he does.

When I moved out, they tried to charge me with a whole bunch of spurious claims of damage to the apartment. There was a little bit of a mess that I cleaned up, and that was about it. When I got a lawyer involved, they dropped all the charges.

Avoid this place at all costs, as they will not respect your privacy, they will intrude into your apartment, you will have pests from the moment you move in, and they don't handle noise complaints at all, of which there is a ridiculous amount of noise in that building."
920,MANPREET SINGH TANDON,BRAMPTON,Great landlord always.
921,JON/CAROLINE WILLIAMS,COURTICE,"I'd rate 0 if possible. Absolute scumlords. Completely victimize people who don't know their tenant rights. Septic issues, mold, rat infestation, you name it. ""Fix"" issues themselves with Band-aids that don't last! Was without a fridge for 6 months with no rent abatement. They are bullies and absolute scum that spy on you to try to blackmail and extort you. I'm currently suing them. Do not live here for your own safety and sanity!!"
922,WILSTAR MANAGEMENT,ETOBICOKE,They've been doing a bunch of renovations and updates on the building I live in but it's in the most inefficient way possible. They also don't want to deal with a tenants on a human level. During the winter they didn't even shovel the sidewalk in front of their buildings.
923,KAZI SHAMIAR,GUELPH,Guy is an absolute POS. Will enter your room when you're not there.
924,ANITA MUI,TORONTO,STAY FAR AWAY. The house we rented had so many problems & the contractors they use never fix things properly & create more problems half the time. They also charged an illegal key deposit fee & utilities deposit which they kept even though everything was paid for & keys were returned.
925,RHONDA WHITE,LINDSAY,Disrespectful and used illegal N7 notices to evict. Did not return deposit.
926,DUSHAN BALA,HAMILTON,Dushan is a respectful and friendly landlord. He fixes issues quickly and is always polite. The best landlord we've had.
927,EDMOND ST. AMOUR HOLDINGS LIMITED,OTTAWA,"This man. Is by far the sweetest most responsible landlord I have ever dealt with. He is totally approachable, and corrects any issues within a day. There are no bugs, the premises are routinely vacuumed and mopped. I do not want to leave my place. I found heaven!"
928,FARID ELEJEL,LONDON,"Horrible. Just Horrible. Not only does he just want someone to PAY OUT of pocket for repairs, when you call him out on the LTB laws he tries to sell the house. Constant threats of illegal rent increases, selling and ""cant you just use your savings"" are put into place when you ask him to fix even essentials. Ignores and neglects his properties in every sense, only contacts you for the rent. Sells the houses or tries to evicts the tenants when they become ""too much"" for him."
929,BRENT VANDERWOUDE,HAMILTON,"Brent's a good landlord, maintains the property and leaves you alone."
930,JOHN BADOVINAC,TORONTO,"John is a good landlord and maintains his property well. There are some areas that I wish were maintained better, but overall everything is in good condition. 
John is friendly and respectful."
931,MARTIN CABRAL,TORONTO,"Does bare minimum repairs, will not do anything too expensive and it can take a very long time. 
The property manager himself is nice enough but also doesn't help much for getting things done. 
Work done can be half assed. 
Will increase rent legal maximum every year."
932,CHRIS BURKHART,GUELPH,"Honestly Chris has been amazing, he purchased the house from the previous landlord and has taken it over seamlessly. He's always easy to reach and makes certain that repairs are done in a timely manner, he's easy to talk to and respectful, and seems very aware that while it is his business it is also someone's home. 

Seriously, Chris is awesome. We've had nothing but great experiences with him and he's pretty receptive to home improvements as well, within reason of course. Stuff is expensive yo, especially house stuff"
933,WILLIAM BUTLER,BRANTFORD,So far so good dee issues with the appliances that need to be dealt with have just moved into the residence.
934,BILL KOVACS,THUNDER BAY,"Absolute asshole, found the coin operated washer dryer hydro connected to my panel which we pay hydro for. Said he could give us 2 bucks a month back..... Did the math he owes us 22 bucks a month in usage. Mold fill apartment, flooded twice, cracked windows, windows blow open even if locked, hallway ceiling leaks, didn't have a functional stove for a month, always smells like smoke."
935,BLACKLINE MANAGEMENT/ ROCKCAP INC.,KITCHENER,"Never ever rent from these greedy despicable people. They took the roof off our building to add two additional floors during the pandemic which resulted in nearly the entire building receiving extensive water damage between Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. To make matters worse, the entire building was evacuated during one particularly bad rainfall in the spring of 2021 and after the 72 hours of waiting in a hotel we returned to our units only to find that the building had been locked up and a security guard put in place to prevent us from entering. Given that so many of us had work orders in place with Bylaw to have the damage and mold rectified, this landlord took the opportunity to issue N13 orders to force us out by November 2021 so he could raise the rent once any salvage work had been completed. These people are true scum and have done this to multiple buildings."
936,IAIN ROBINSON,PETERBOROUGH,"Constantly showed up unannounced, even going so far as to let himself in without notice of a visit. Made me sign a new lease instead of allowing the lease to go to month to month. Didn't want me to stay on because he would have to rent out bedrooms instead of the whole house and tried to intimidate me into moving out. The basement bedrooms didn't have safe egress windows. Bragged about his and his wife's expensive cars to me."
937,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,KITCHENER,"I've lived here for a little over a year now and it has been quite a poor experience. They did not inform us of the bedbug and cockroach infestations in the building before we moved in. A week after we moved in I started to see roaches in the kitchen, this problem persisted for 7 months until we took it into our own hands and caulked all the crevices of our kitchen so they couldn't get in anymore, Pest control did not help. Now we have started to see bedbugs in our bathroom that are somehow getting in from a neighbouring unit, have tried caulking but cant seem to find the entry point. We didn't have a working oven for 7-8 months and we submitted work orders 3 times, eventually they did give us a replacement oven but it was used and not in the best condition or clean. The fire alarms in the building are not working properly and there have been several false alarms which is a pain especially in the middle of the night and they can never figure out how to shut it off properly. The garbage room is always a mess, the hallways rarely get vacuumed. I would avoid any homestead building at all costs."
938,SAEED NEJATIAN,NORTH YORK,"Don't fix any things, do not turn the chiller, do not have appropriate heating, its finish is very old and broken, and ...."
939,ANKIT AND DHARMESH PATEL,TORONTO,Huge racist assholes who refuse to rent anyone who is not of thier race . Repairs always take weeks no matter what and good luck having them clean your place before you move in.
940,OXFORD PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Mostly very good, I find they always increase the rent as much as they can legally do so despite making no improvements to common areas like the gym or the patio."
941,NOTTINGHAM VILLAGE INC.,BURLINGTON,"I have lived at Nottingham for the past 5 years and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. My unit was renovated before moving in so there have been very few maintenance issues, but any problems I have had were delt with quickly. No plans on leaving any time soon and I have friends on a waiting list to move here as well. I would highly recommend living here. The only negative I have is that the parking lot really needs to be repaved, they just keep patching it."
942,BRIAN KELLER,BARRIE,Best landlord I’ve ever had! Laid back and professional.
943,YAN LIN,RICHMOND HILL,"Good person , but very hard to pay for repair"
944,TIVOLI TOWERS INC,TORONTO,I've lived here for 9 years. The gaslighting harassment the lack of renovations the nosy neighbors. Landlords drive expensive Mercedes yet they'll never fix the leaks they do nothing about roaches and bed bugs they don't pant they don't listen. To wear and tear they record and they make up lies honestly if you have a problem call the city 311 put pressure on them .  I hope if enough people call they will fix this issue. I've honestly caught them putting water on my wood floor. Please use a webcam and never leave them alone in your unit.
945,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,Marda will screw you over any chance they get. They will list a rental as all inclusive then tell you it was a mistake and is plus utilities when you go to sign the lease. They do not follow the laws set out for landlord and tenants and will send something to collections ruining your credit score without legally proving any money was owed. Any repairs or maintenance takes forever to schedule and they put all responsibility on the tenant for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers to be working and up to date. They should be shut down
946,RAMAN MANN,EAST YORK,Literally the best landlord you could ask for
947,GLORIA CARR,STIRLING,"Herself, her son and her son would just come over whenever they wanted. We had a shared lane way and they aloud a neighbor across the street to pack his school bus there. It takes them months and months to get things repaired if they even do it. All the floors needed to replaced and she agreed that they would be done room by room with us still in the house, the back bedroom would be fixed up, sunroom would be fixed, and none of it was done in the almost three years I lived there. They fixed the furnace after three dang months of it not working and the next day they handed me an eviction notice."
948,PAM WILSON,LONDON,great landlord
949,STEPHANE LECAVALIE,KITCHENER,Horrible landlord.. didn’t want to do any repairs. Was there for 3 years and had to fight for repairs. Had a lot of mold he refused to deal with to where inspector had to come in just to get things repaired.. in bathroom he did a cover up job with paint didn’t get rid of mold
950,EIWO CANADIAN MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,"Since moving into a unit managed by Eiwo a few years ago I've been:
1. Threatened with eviction for not following unwritten/unposted ""rules""
2. Threatened with eviction for their own paperwork mistakes
3. Threatened with eviction for denying them access to my unit after receiving illegal entry notices

Every time I call the main office to talk about these issues or maintenance, they ask if I've spoken to the on-site property manager. When I respond that after my prior interactions with him that I will not speak with him, they concede that I'm not the only tenant who's taken that stance and they know there are issues with him. The office manager for this property never returns phone calls and somehow is never in the office when I call at any hours of the work day. When there are issues with winter maintenance (parking lot ice that both myself and my child have fallen on) I'm told they're having issues with the contractor. Not my problem, Eiwo is ultimately responsible and needs to figure it out. There is no accountability or sense of responsibility at Eiwo. I have been renting in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for over 15 years and Eiwo is by far the worst I have dealt with so far.

I'm not a difficult tenant to deal with. Screws came loose on my door knob, fixed it myself. Cheap cupboard door fell off, fixed it myself. Toilet flapper leaking, fixed it myself. Fuses, light bulbs, smoke alarm batteries, I handle all of it myself. I was raised in rentals and my parents always handled whatever they could before asking the landlord to look after it. The only significant issue I've asked Eiwo to deal with in the unit is sewage backing up into the basement. Which has been a repeated problem for the past 2 years! Instead of fixing the actual pipes they just keep calling in a company to snake the drains when someone complains about them backing up again.

Managing rental units is their entire job and they are terrible at every aspect of it. Avoid them at all costs."
951,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"This LL sends out a terrifying ""we will take your AC if you dont pay our ridiculous 350$ summer AC cost"". We had to get the LTB involved to get them to back off. They will give less than 24 hrs notice to come in. They are rude, hostile, and extremely slow to respond to repair requests. Don't live here"
952,LIUNA LOCAL 527 NON-PROFIT HOUSING CORPORATION.  ,OTTAWA,"Always cockroaches being sprayed for as well as bedbugs. Also an ant infestation. Tenants are not permitted any congregating in or on the building/property. There is no designated smoking area. I pay almost $1500.00 rent and I feel like I live in a prison. They have so many surveillance cameras that I feel like my personal privacy is being watched no matter what I do or where I am. This building manager is a power hungry person and enjoys making people like myself and others stressed and depressed. Dorothy Boal gives N5's like Oprah gives away gifts. You get one, and you get one, everyone gets an N5. Example an N5 was given to 2 different tenants for improper recycling for using blue recycling bags that couldn't fit in the recycling bin due to the bins being chain locked. Some of the most stupid reasons I have ever seen. She violates tenants human rights when she thinks she won't be confronted by the tenants. I have heard and seen it happen. "
953,KIRAN KRISHNAMURTHY,TORONTO,Kiran and his wife Vaishali are wonderful landlords. They have sent people to repair things the same day and are always available to communicate with. They operate with respect and kindness. They want us to be happy so that they can be happy and simply collect their fairly priced rent. If you see their name on a form then sign it!
954,MD ZAMAN,WINDSOR,He is really a good as a person and as a landlord.
955,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"SCUM. This man is an absolute vilain. He will coerce you in to paying extra fees, ignore you when you need help and berate you when he feels youre in the wrong. We finally moved out because we couldn't take it anymore. Rats in the basement that were never dealt with and similar stories of money and services being withheld from all the other tennants in our building. DO NOT RENT FROM HIM"
956,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"I rented from Edward over a decade ago and have never experienced a landlord as horrific before or since. The property was infested with mice and cockroaches. There was a leaky ceiling that he ""repaired"" by placing a tarp and a giant rock on the roof. He was abrasive, rude and hostile. After our one-year lease was up, raised rent considerably until we signed a second lease (we did not). We were in our late twenties and I suspect he preys on younger people and students who don't know their rights. Negligent, illegal, ridiculous, enraging. AVOID!"
957,MOTEVALLI ,TORONTO,"Targets immigrants and charges a safety deposit over the last deposit. First deposit is used for the last month and the second deposit is a 'safety' which was the same price as the monthly rent, of which I never got back because he said something was left behind in the apt. Other things included no access to the thermostat so it could get really hot inside even though its single digits on the outside, mice that would pop by to check up on you through holes in the drywall and a shower that floods so you can pretend it's a tiny bath tub."
958,SJB PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"The landlord tried to evict us using false noise complaints claims so we installed a camera and provided video evidence during the time of their complaints.

They tried to charge us 100$ to clean a driveway they were going to reseal. 

They let our roof leak for 4 years. It damaged the floor, no repair is to be done for the floor. ""I'm not paying for that""

The windows aren't sealed correctly and leach humidity into the walls and cause black mold to form. There's black mold on our blinds.

The landlord asked if we'd like to pay more rent (donate money to subsidize their lifestyle) because of ""upgrades to the building"" which was, a bad hallway paint job that ruined the apsrtment door insulation. Install of a gate around the parking lot with key access only. Only people who pay to park get a key which means if you get locked in there as a guest when you're leaving, you're potentially stuck. If there's a fire you can't reach minimumsafe distance if the front exit is blocked. And a black granite entrance.

If you forget your keys taking out the garbage you're stuck. There is no magnetic release.


The building got broken into and a crackhead broke into my locker. 0 recourse or follow up done. There was a report made about the break in but nothing about the locker room."
959,MARK MOHAMMUD MASUD ALAM,OSHAWA & AJAX,"When he bought the house off my last landlord (who was great btw) he illegally tried to raise my rent by 300 dollars ignoring the 1.2% yearly maximum. He then moved in a drug addicted single mother of 4 children (ranging in age from 10-2) who harrassed us by looking in our windows and having her children yell at us through the vents as well as physically try to fight me many times. I sould take film and email/text these to him and he would do nothing! He did let me break my lease to move out after I threatened labour board/ legal action against him, but had the nerve to keep my last months rent and ask me after I moved to resend the videos so he could evict her as she had started to harass the next tenants after me. LOL yall deserve each other, id never help him out for what is ""his"" problem now!"
960,LUPUS AND ASSOCIATES 2501869 ONTARIO INC.,GTA,"Worst landlords ever. Have a working Brothel and are well aware and will not do anything to ensure Tenent safety. I have John's walking into my apartment, once armed threatening my safety.  They add illegal rent increases and repair nothing. Buildings are mold infested."
961,JASON MOON,LONDON,"Doesn't do anything to resolve issues with property even though he is there every day. Mice in the building, including his restuaraunt that didn't try to do anything about, pipes frozen and he just let them thaw and break open, been 2 fires from lack of maintenance on the building, and that is just some of the issues avoid as a land lord if possible."
962,CHRISTOS AND TIM MARDICIS,KINGSTON,Ignorant and aggressive with tenants. Disrespectful to tenants and neighbors. Money is all that matters. Never ever fixes a thing. City always getting involved for repairs.
963,LYNE LAROSE,SUDBURY,"Constantly came unannounced, at early morning hours with no notice. Mice infestation, refused to fix multiple times. Mostly just the showing up unannounced"
964,TRIDENT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"Kristin and Devon are amazing and prompt. They answer calls, emails and are very friendly. I appreciate all of their help over the years and they are fantastic at their jobs."
965,ROB CROWLEY,PETERBOROUGH,"Rented from Rob for a few years. Excellent guy who charges a very fair rent amount. He is very quick with responses, and deals with issues around the building very quickly. As a student renting for the first time, I am glad that Rob did not take advantage of my situation."
966,"STEPHEN LENNOX, MARY KAYE PARK",OSHAWA,Landlords filed for eviction before Christmas for $1000 of Rental arrears. Arrears we’re paid in Full in January and subsequent months rent were paid in full. LTB filing fee also paid to landlord. Landlord refuses to withdraw L1 and wishes to proceed with hearing for no reason other than to harass us for the 4 months wait until the hearing.
967,LIVE WELL,HAMILTON,Had a heating issue this winter for a week
968,DONNA MUIR,HAMILTON,Just horrible. Never fixed anything. Cockroach and mold ridden Apts.
969,NEXMIL,LONDON,So much mould that hasn’t been dealt with in months.
970,ALLAN HIGNELL & BEVERLEY RILEY & PCC182,MISSISSAUGA,"I have been living in my rental for 7.5 years.  There are many defects within the home that the landlord will not fix.  The floors are sinking due to the subfloor shifting.  Foundation cracks that have allowed water on one side, leaking gas from another side and chemicals from a 3rd side to enter the unit.  Mold in the windows and moisture in the walls below the windows that he will not remove.  Mold in the shower of one bathroom and the floor of the other washroom that he won’t remove.  Drafty doors and windows that he will not fix.  Sinking staircase with complete separation from the dry wall going from the 2nd floor to the basement.
Load bearing wall with piling in the corners.  The dryer venting leaks into the house and the says that is the best it will get.  The roof is pulling from the front of the house and the siding is lifting off.  When you ask for repairs and ultimately call in the city, he puts the house up for sale as it is now and forces the tenant to be without a place because it’s listed as “buyer must move in” There have been a lot of illegal actions that this landlord has taken during the lease and Collection of rent.

I have never missed or been late on a rental payment."
971,AUGUST NUZIATO,FONTHILL,"Total cheapskate - beautiful house, but he was horrible with repairs, have tons and tons of photos of the inadequate jobs he has done while I was living there - very cheap rent but overall this man is more pompous than a greek god, 

Stay away."
972,BLAZE PROPERTIES INC.,WATERLOO,"I have lived here for over 8 years, and it's a terrific company. The superintendent is quick to fix any repairs, always follows the rules, and is always available to hear concerns. The building is clean and well laid out in a good location"
973,GOLDEN EQUITY,TORONTO,Will not read or reply to emails. Did not do mediated agreement. Does not do maintenence requests via email or portal.
974,EIWO,GUELPH,"Move in here if you want to wait over a week to get a battery replaced in your fire alarm because we’re “not allowed” to change them ourselves. Move in here if you want to wait over a week to get a single lightbulb changed in your bathroom and have to use a flashlight to shower because we’re “not allowed” to change them ourselves. Move in here if you were told on October 28, three days prior to a parking lot renovation taking place, due to a leak in the underground parking area with an estimated completion date of December 1st and it’s now April 28th and it’s still nowhere near done…with ZERO communication since the letter was posted in the building. Forcing all tenants parking above ground to park on the side streets and have no visitor parking. Move in here if you want a working buzzer to enter the building 3/30 days in a month (yes that’s an exaggeration but it’s broken within days of being “fixed” every time). Move in here if you’re promised repairs on top of the ones previously mentioned that take months and months for them to follow through on, if at all. Move in here if you want to pay a literal arm and a leg for landlords that don’t care about the tenants or the building itself."
975,DESTARTON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MISSISSAUGA,Possibly the worst in the busness and he has buildings all over the place not just this one.
976,CAMBRIDGE REALTY GROUP,HAMILTON,"Absolute best landlords you could hope for. Friendly, understanding, rational. All correspondence is responded to in very good time. Repairs are done with no argument. No shady business, no unfair rules. Everything done by the book. Stellar people to rent from. 10/10"
977,ROYAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - KENTE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT LTD.,MADOC,"The issues with this company are more on the end of neglect and incompetence. Luckily they have never have been verbally abusive, however contractors hired by the have been. When repairs are actually done, the contractors they hire are completely unprofessional and unqualified and the ""repairs"" far from acceptable. There has been damage in the common area that has gone without being repaired for literally years. Other tenants have gone without bathroom fans etc. 

The worst offense is snow and ice clearing in winter. It often simple goes without being done for a week at a time, regardless of the fact we have many elderly tenants, at least one of which who HAS fallen on the ice previously. When it is done? They cause massive amounts of damage to their own  property and landscaping and block cars in with snow drifts. Their snow contractors have also threatened tenants who haven't moved their vehicles on time."
978,TL BOTHWELL,GUELPH,"Completely unable to follow through on repairs - when they are done, often other appliances have been broken, the problem has not been fixed, and used parts/poo workmanship ends up leaving an eye sore. They have also repeatedly lied about completing repairs, and often try to force tenants to do their job by contacting the repair people directly.
They have repeatedly tried to enter the apartment or change the rental agreement without proper notice and are quick to make threats.
Moneywise, they always raise rent the maximum amount possible but haven't tried anything illegal.
They have never been verbally abusive, but have failed to respond to complaints and been disrespectful and patronizing in communication. They are unprofessional and complain about how many properties they are managing."
979,GOWAN PROPERTIES/WATERLOO APT,TORONTO,They barely clean once a week. Crackheads sleep in stairwells and hallways.  They try and get tenants to pay for repairs.  They take forever and years to do the minor repairs.  Forcing people to pay rent increases before they are approved.  Easily can break in the building.
980,CHUNG V TRAN,HAMILTON,"I wanted to take a moment to give a big shout-out to my current landlord. I've rented a full house from him and his wife since 06-2020 and I have to say they are the best landlords I have ever had! They treated us like family and were always available to help us out with maintenance, grass-cutting, and snow removal. They even gave us gifts at the start of each year and when a new baby arrived in the family. They are such kind-hearted and thoughtful people that it's bittersweet to be moving on since the house is being sold. I highly recommend anyone looking for a great landlord to rent from them. Thank you so much for everything!"
981,BARRY COLGROVE,TORONTO,Always good experiences!
982,LAMBA,BOWMANVILLE,"While paying over market value,  for an extremely small one bedroom basement walk out. We encountered constant water leaks and a kitchen so full.of mold it was unusable. The washer and dryer provided were in the kitchen. Which had at minimum an inch of standing water at all times. The issue was not repaired until they forced an eviction and we had moved out. We have dozens of photos and video to back up these statements. 

Our landlord told us it ""wasn't that bad"" and waited until we had vacated to have a licensed plumber fix the leak."
983,SOHAM AWHAIM,HAMILTON,"Upon renting the property from her, she denied me access to the mailbox key, citing it as illegal. However, I managed to replace the keys after a few months, and compelled her to accept the new ones. She frequently visited the property without giving the legally required 24-hour notice, and progressively raised the rent, prioritizing money over the tenants. After I moved out, she demanded I pay nearly $40k to repair the kitchen cabinets, despite only a minor scratch being present on a few shelves"
984,JHW PROPERTIES JEFF AND HILLARY WALKER,OSHAWA,"JHW properties are located in Oshawa and rent out to a number of various properties Oshawa/Peterborough area.
These people are horrible.
They do not take care of the properties
They Harass tenants
They have completed rent evictions in most of their properties and if tenants do not accept their offers they will Harass until the tenant moves
They enter units without permission
They offer units in adds that are not accurate to what the unit contain.  eg: I was promised a brand new stove and fridge.  Was told day of move it in would be delayed.  After 8 months of asking about this it was never provided.
They threaten and have turned off building hydro in the middle of the winter with no concern for their tenants
The laundry machines do not work 
The buildings are never cleaned
Stay away.  Worst living experience ever"
985,PARKSIDE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT /LANDLORD COMPANY'S NAME IS SUE,LONDON,Building company sucks as repairs still haven't been done 5 years later. Rent is really good for a 1 bedroom at around 850/month. The actual live in building managers are great and the neighbors for the most part mind their own business. They allow pets and they're not to bad when it comes to noise. Location is good. All in all 7/10
986,YUN TAO LI,RICHMOND HILL,"He is grumpy, if the rent is late one day, he comes to the house and keeps ringing so nervous. If you say that I will pay the rent next week, he will not understand at all and will soon bring you a complaint form. No respect at all. I have never had such a bad landlord, but this is really bad and impolite. when something needs repair, he doesn't do it. its fridge has a problem but don't change it. He just wants Money. I hope no one has a landlord like this."
987,JESSICA Y,LONDON,Been renting from Jessica for over a year. She is very responsive and takes good care of the unit. Our building management is also very nice. We enjoy our time renting from her.
988,DEVI,RICHMONDHILL,"This is rated based on the last year we lived there. She was good up until she had to sell the house. Devi hired a real estate agent to take over. She refused all communication with us. She gave us a false promise that she was going to help us find a place to live but never did. She also did not want us to leave until her house was sold and put us in a situation with children to have 3 months to leave or POSSIBLY be able to stay. We didn’t want to take that chance and wanted to move. We asked her if we could use her as a reference she said yes and made a letter for me. When my real estate agent found us a house we didn’t get the place because SHE TALKED HORRIBLE ABOUT US! So we couldn’t move early. We lived there for about 10 years! Had a good relationship and understanding for a long time. The tiles in the bathroom fell and she wanted us to fix the tiles and lied to me that the downstairs gave her the cock to put on the tiles. The basement people were violent and abusive. She aloud them to live there and they were vulgar. Screaming and yelling breaking our kids toys (electric car) and waved a tool in my face. I asked about the tool to use for the tiles. I ruined the tool because I am licensed and I didn’t know how to fix the wall. When we did finally move she tried to come after me for damages. The walls were peeling due to the paint that was used, and the tiles were falling. She also didn’t give us our interest every year nor gave me receipts.

I forced her to have things in e-transfer because she did lie to me about money. I came straight from the bank with cash money in the envelope. She wouldn’t count in front of me and said we can be friends you don’t need the receipt. After she closed the door she quickly re opened it and said I was missing money somehow. I was always upset about that. So I forced e-transfers. I was glad to because when I was paying utilities she would lie a few time oh I didn’t pay the portion. Then realized I was pregnant and said oh I see it here never mind. 

She aloud the real estate agent come every single day and forced us out of the house everyday because they had viewings everyday. We had to look into our rights to stop them from being invasive and not kick us out with kids pregnant during winter time everyday because of viewings. 

Devi told us that we didn’t have to pay full rent on the first but pay majority and then a few days later the rest. She said to be helpful and be able to give us a break from anything. She used that against us saying we don’t pay rent on time even know that was a verbal agreement. She was nice enough to allow us to have internet under her name and we paid her the 100$ every month. When we moved she claimed she was months behind. I told her I paid once a month and what ever she did with that money is not my fault if it wasn’t used for the internet."
989,JANE MCNAMARA ZOSCHKE,BRACEBRIDGE,"I had lived at my address for 25 years, when it was sold in April 2022. This new owner immediately delivered a N12 stating her mother was moving in. In the last year I have received notices interfering with my utilities, stating she was going to change locks at the end of the N12, had amenities taken away, refused to clear snow while still clearing it from other tenants, and had my door opened by her. I have been stalked and harassed. Harassment is not limited to tenants. The N12 was withdrawn due to errors. New N12 states she is moving in. Stay away from this landlord."
990,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"Rents roach infested properties, then blames it on you. 
Illegal and bizarre extra charges 
Constantly emails you and is super passive aggressive, or blatantly a total jerk. 
Sometimes just shows up with no 24 hour notice. 
Property is disgustingly filthy.
Fails to prevent mice or roaches. 
Fails to make repairs on time, if at all. 
Blames tenants for issues with the property that is clearly his responsibility. 
Rude, hostile, and recommend you walk the other way and not give him your money."
991,MARCIA FRAISER,TORONTO,She knocked on my door everyday and used to check my place. I informed her that my parents will be visiting but she denied my request although it was my right to bring whomever I want to the place I’m renting. She made false accusations towards me and emotionally and verbally harassed me. Do NOT recommend you to rent her walkout basement!
992,JASON MCBAIN,SUDBURY,"He's busy so repairs aren't always done promptly but otherwise have no complaints, building is safe and clean. He's easy to talk to, understanding and nice. If something is an emergency he's there in minutes."
993,KEITH BRACKEN,LONDON,Wonderful landlord. Makes repairs fast and resolves issues quickly.
994,CITY OF BRANTFORD,BRANTFORD,"Slovak Village has went down hill more every year for the past 6 years or so. Current superintendent does nothing about people yelling and screaming for hours, sometimes days at a time. Drug use is getting worse. People sleeping in hallways after being locked out during a fight. Packages being stolen by a tenant and nothing is done. Rent is cheapest around and only place that is within reason, but it has begun to become a place where you can’t raise a family even if you don’t socialize."
995,GOLDMAR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"The only thing I asked was there not be bugs in the unit. I could tolerate a lot but bugs are a big deal for me and I stressed that multiple times to the lady from Goldmar showing me the unit. She assured me it was clean and it's never had a problem so I moved in. Literally on the second day I found a cockroach on my couch. I told her and they could only bring pest control during my work hours so I couldn't be home while they were treating the place. I ask them if they want me to move any of my items and they said no preparation necessary. I return to my rental to find white powder which I assume is Borax to treat the roaches, all over my personal items and cooking supplies in the kitchen. A joke of a company."
996,MIKE MONTAZER,HAMILTON,Always gets back to me to solve any issues quickly
997,RYAN SCHWERDTNER,TORONTO,"Not only does this LL hide the presence of extreme repair needs like covering up black mold in the ceilings and bathrooms and burying construction debris in the backyards, he also refuses to do his job as a LL when it comes to safety and providing housing free of discrimination, actively protecting a tenant who attempted to break in and cause physical harm to other tenants on his property due to being homo and trans phobic. He does not follow the law regarding notice of entry, and over all he’s extremely emotionally reactive when you ask him to do anything. He also lacks boundaries telling you everything about his personal life as reasons why he can’t do his job properly. He doesn’t do rent increases but that’s because he keeps slum houses that are dirty and actively falling apart with garbage building up. He has multiple city of Toronto and human rights complaints."
998,LIONSGATE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LEAMINGTON,"Woke up to an overflowing bathroom sink 2 weeks into moving in and they wouldn't believe me that it was overflowing until I made a big deal. When they sent someone over they tried to charge me $235 for repairing it claiming I was putting stuff down the sink I shouldn't of been. It's a bathroom sink, nothing goes in there except water and soap and 2 weeks is not even enough time to clog it. When I wouldn't pay the, maintenance woman(Kailey or whatever her name was, large woman) would come knock at my door very loudly and ask for her money. Multiple times after I said I wouldn't pay. Then the property manager himself would yell at me over the phone. This place is a total joke. Joseph will harass you for whatever slight and David will never tell you the truth. I'd never rent from this property management company again."
999,SHAWN,OTTAWA,Excellent
1000,REALSTAR,TORONTO,"Place is like a frat house, run by an absentee manager who's unprofessional, uncouth and relies on snitching and intimidation. Stay away unless you want to end up with mental health issues."
1001,JENNIFER GERVAIS,NORTH COBALT,"Jennifer Gervais and her husband are slum lords plain and simple. Since taking over the 5 unit building I live in, numerous promises for repairs have been made. The place is old and outdated and needs some tlc. None of these promised repairs have been made. Multiple tenants have mild issues and were told it’s normal and nothing to worry. Despite regular cleanings, mold persists. The place is so poorly insulated you can feel cool air coming through cupboards and various other areas where you definitely shouldn’t be able to feel any cool air. We were promised it was going to be fixed, but when I requested that the next time they come I would appreciate 24h notice, they gave me a big hassle and didn’t end up coming. Jennifer was rude l, told us how kind she was by letting us use the hallway and they didn’t need 24h notice to access it. We are the sole users of this hallway and the only ones with a key to access it.  Rent was increased this year, by a reasonable amount, but this place is not taken care of and nothing has been fixed or updated so it seems really greedy to increase the rent."
1002,JIE XU,RICHMOND HILL,Stay away.
1003,RIOCAN,TORONTO,"Took over the building I lived in for 20 years around 6 years ago. They focus on the main building for any improvements first, good luck if you have a repair scheduled, terrible at dealing with their cockroach problem."
1004,MD TAUHID UZ ZAMAN,WINDSOR,Zaman is an excellent landlord. He's very good and respectful with me and other tenants. His house is very ambient and comfortable to live. Happy to be a part of that.
1005,DEBRA UNKNOWN (ARNSBY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),LONDON,"Debra is simply a mean old woman. She screams at tenants and delivery people. You can hear her shouting at people on the ground floor, from anywhere in the building. Just awful."
1006,KEVIN LU (RIVERSTONE INVESTMENT),HAMILTON,"The property is in a constant state of disrepair. Outdoor space is only maintained after orders from city of hamilton. Indoor repairs are never completed in a timely manner. Broken windows left for months, hallway lights never replaced. The repairs that are completed are all done by the owner who doesn’t complete them with any standards or care for quality. Rent with caution!"
1007,MARTIN SCOTT,LINDSAY,"From black mold in the bathroom and mice in the kitchen, to 3 non working smoke detectors (the weren’t even wired in), and 7:30am knocks on my door if I was a day late for rent. This landlord did absolutely nothing to try and fix any of my problems while I stayed here and thought the best thing to do was serve me countless eviction notices during COVID. He discriminated against me being on government assistance and preyed on the fact I didn’t know my tenant rights to continually fuck me over."
1008,HOLLYBURN,TORONTO,Instability with property supervisors. Low quality office management on-site.
1009,MATT FROMM,KITCHENER,"Hands down the best landlord I have ever had.  He did not raise our rents and often gives us $100 gift cards on birthdays and Christmas.

Consider yourself lucky if you ever rent from Matt."
1010,KG GROUP,TORONTO,Really good place to live but expensive.
1011,TAWHID ZAMAN,WINDSOR,Good
1012,UPLIFT VENTURES RACHEL HOLDEN,BARRIE,"Enters without notice, doesn't maintain property, garbage everywhere. 
Pests.
Refuses to address bylaw complaints.
Slumlord."
1013,LEXINGTON PARK,WATERLOO,"The Landlord, Hoffer, owner of Lexington Park, is a terrible landlord and an indecent person. 

The secretary girls are incredibly incompetent. 

Not a good building to live in. He should get into a different industry, this one is clearly not for him."
1014,MIRJA RAITA,RICHMOND HILL,"Things that are said in passing or meant to be genuine conversations get turned and used against you. If something upsets her it becomes a spiral effect of emotion, and she becomes ungrounded and ruthless. Plays so charming in the beginning but unfortunately takes a twist later if something doesn't appease her. Claiming to do things by the board but contradicts herself creating a grey area in how things are handled.  I know the other tenants in this triplex have had concerns and issues as well. We also found out she uses the neighbors camera to keep tabs on us.  It took 3 months to handle a rat problem within the household after much destruction of property. Everything in the house seems to be  diy job so it leaves most things in a state of liability to your use of it.  Minimal to no consideration or respect from her. Also a complete refusal of accountability, it is always the tenants fault."
1015,ACE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CORNWALL,"Several years back, I rented an apartment from them at Cumberland Gardens.. On several occasions, they claimed I hadn’t paid rent, and had to provide proof from my bank that they had in fact cashed the rent cheques.. Unreliable, impossible to get ahold of them for repairs, and all around scumlords!"
1016,MARINA THOMPSON,CARELTON PLACE,"Broke into our home numerous times, I had to go a month without a bathroom, kitchen sink n stove, finally repairing myself. House is full of asbestos and she does nothing. Took a skid steer and plowed my kids things into the ground. Finally settled in LTB
Worst landlord around"
1017,REALSTAR PROPERTY MANAGEMENET,KITCHENER,"Absolutely expensive (though everywhere is) despite the elevators constantly out of order for maintenance. Told us to move our cars at 8am three days in a row for pavement cleaning and painting, only for a third of all car spots to actually be painted. Rooftop patios are closed (AGAIN) for repairs. Gym is okay, very small and with 4 machine's that are always in use. They're so slow for maintenance repairs. Our microwave is broken. Our smoke alarms are defective. It's been nearly two months of waiting and following up but they're 'waiting for new shipments'. And they never address noise complaints. They give no notice when they're entering for showings if you decide to move out, so after they give that blanket notice of 'we will have showings from 9-5 Monday to Friday' they can come in at any point which is awful if you're working from home, trying to make lunch, or in the bathroom. They don't maintain the outdoor parking garage in a timely manner so expect to get your car stuck in snow until mid-afternoon the day after a storm. Recycling bins are always full. Garbage shoots are under maintenance and out of order at least 2-3 times a week. And they also play favourites."
1018,RICHARD BRANT,OTTAWA,Richard Brant has many properties he rents to Carleton University students. He has far too many tenants to attend to and ignores repairs as well as bug problems. He also never cut the grass as specified in the lease and ignored all the shingles that fell off our roof as well as the hole eventually caused by this and a leak in the bathroom ceiling. Our house was also missing a railing that was definitely required for safety. Too many tenants and only cares about their money.
1019,GLENNVIEW,OTTAWA,"DO NOT RENT FROM GLENNVIEW.  KAREN IS A KAREN. IT IS NOT OK TO LOCK TENANTS OUT OF THEIR BALCONY WHEN NO WORK IS BEING DONE. THEY DO NOT VALUE TBE RENTERS, THEY MAKES US FEEL LIKE THEY RE DOING US A FAVOR, WE ARE PAYING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE INCLUDING THE BALCONY.  NO COMPENSATION FOR WHAT THEY RE TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR TENANTS. STAY AWAY FROM GLENNVIEW."
1020,DAVID WANG,TORONTO,Overall good. Old apartment and no repairs taken place.
1021,AXON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"Pretty good ngl, so far so good"
1022,VINAY KHANNA,TORONTO,Will expect illegal deposits that he doesn't return when the tenancy ends. Unit flooded with sewage multiple times. Took weeks to address with no accommodations to the tenant living in such conditions. Has actively ignored the growing mold from the neglected floods. Will bring up rent by arbitrary amount whenever he sees fit. Will make inappropriate comments about his tenants and their sexuality. Threatens to ignore your calls when you speak of health and safety concerns with the unit. Expects property maintenance to be done by his tenants.
1023,SHERWOOD GARDENS ELLEN HILLIER,AJAX,"The Superintendent Ellen Hillier as well as the property management company Brosko Management are horrendous to deal with, especially if you have pest problems.  The buildings are known to have infestations of bed bugs and cockroaches.  They use the cheapest pest control companies they can find and it takes months and months to get rid of bugs.  Some people have been living with bedbugs for over 8 months.  The Superintendent is rude and sarcastic when you have to call in with big issues."
1024,GEOFF LAYTON/ MUNRO PROPERTIES,WATERLOO,Geoff has been great. Anything that needs to be done gets done in a timely fashion and we barely speak because there are never any issues.
1025,AKELIUS,TORONTO,Akelius has no respect for people.
1026,LYUDMILA AND ALEX SIMONOV,WINDSOR,Horrible landlords. Everything old and broken. Won’t fix anything- blame you for their 1980s fixtures breaking…rude. Was almost physically assaulted by Alex one time… wouldn’t recommend.
1027,ANDY'S APARTMENTS,WATERLOO,"I had the pleasure of.meeting Andy in person. He scams his tenants, and does anything in his power to ensure he gets his way. Every single one of the tenants he had hired to do work for him, would secretly plot against him... Because of his behaviour, and he remained too naive to realize it the entire time. It's never a smart move to hire people your abusing."
1028,ASHBURNHAM REALTY,PETERBOROUGH,"I've rented from Ashburnham for years, a never had a negative interaction or experience with the company - one of the many reasons I've stayed put it because of the way they operate."
1029,OSHANTER DEVELOPMENT,TORONTO,They rented us a unit & had us pay rent then told us we had to vacate for 4 days to finish repairs. The repairs made the unit unsafe to live in. If you had pets they made it a NIGHTMARE when orkin came in refusing to use the gel that wouldn’t kill your pets. They placed literal POISON outside our doorway because of a smell from uncleaned vents from neighbouring doors. Unrelenting harassment across the board. Unwilling to do anything for tenets.
1030,EIWO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"EIWO is a mixed bag. The landlord is nice enough but I think her hands are tied. Pest control isn’t done in a timely manner, especially when new tenants move in and bring bugs with them. It’s always been private, and rent increases have not gone up a lot as expected.

The biggest gripe is that the units are outdated, We’ve been living here forever and the only upgrade they’ve done is a new toilet which really only saves them money. The balcony is still in disrepair and I actually fear mentioning anything to them because they are doing renovictions.. they are charging an absurd price on their renovated units."
1031,MARY SCHILTER,KITCHENER,419 and 425 Lancaster apartments was a great place to live. Landlord very attentive and friendly. Never had any issues with her.
1032,RONG (RONICA) WANG,TORONTO,"Rong Wang is just a bad person. She has no respect for her tenants, nor the legal system. She includes many illegal clauses on her lease, and will guilt and harass her tenants via email, whatsapp, text, phone, etc. if they do not respond within 12 hours. She sends paragraphs filled with threats, and has no regard for the wellbeing of her tenants. On top of all that, she is cheap. Repairs will be done, but for the least possible amount of money she can spend, which often results in poorly completed work. She is just awful to deal with, to the point that I started completing repairs that she was responsible for, simply because I did not want to deal with her essays, complaining, finger-pointing, and rudeness."
1033,RANEE MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"I rent in a building downtown. Company fired the rental office manager the week we moved in. He'd been here for over a decade and seemed like a kind, gentle person well liked by everyone in the building. To replace him, they hired an absolute horror show of a rental manager who is unhelpful and rude in the extreme. She will actively try to find ways not to do her job, does not respond to emails and is never in her office. When she is reachable she is infuriatingly abrupt and cold. Even simple matters.

The building superintendent is an obvious misogynist who was rude to my partner from the moment we moved in. She was trying to get access to the elevator to move in and, after being rude to her, he made us give him $100 to use the elevator as a ""security deposit"", money which he refused to return to us until we argued with him. ""Who you gonna complain to, eh?"" was what he said. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

I had a work vehicle with a sticker on it in my parking space (which I pay $100/month for) but despite that he didn't believe I had the right to park there and called in parking complaints four times, getting me over $100 in tickets, which caused friction with the company I worked at. His complaint was that I was parked in the wrong spot. I wasn't. None of the spots in the lot were numbered and he wouldn't tell me where I -could- park. In the mornings he would wait at my truck and yell at me. After I escalated this conflict the building repainted the parking spots and issued me a permit for the same numbered spot I'd been parked in. A few months later I came home from a weekend away to find someone else had parked in my spot. I had a highly recognizable vehicle which everybody passes on their way out of the parking lot. I parked in another spot nearby and the next morning came out to find my vehicle had been towed across the city which cost me half a day's work and $350.

It's a private 1 bedroom in a building. The superintendent has entered my unit without authorization or notice, changing smoke detector batteries and doing other things. I have a silent security system so this is how I know. A few weeks ago he tried to force his way in with threats, when I was home, because a neighbour's sink was clogged. I asked him for 24 hours notice and refused him entry and he returned handing me a slip of paper dated for the previous day, forging a document granting himself entry. I continued to refuse entry and he started yelling. Ultimately he went and snaked the sink from the neighbours side. He didn't need to enter my unit, as it turns out.

There are cockroaches, fleas and bedbugs in the building. There was feces smeared on the wall in the hall for 5 months and there's dog shit, from a very large dog in the back stairwell at least once a week.  The laundry machines never work, which is ironic because I'm pretty sure it's the Landlord's family which also owns the laundry business. Every few weeks someone gets evicted from the building. It's almost always a man in his 40s, who sits on the lawn outside with all of his possessions, looking bewildered, until the police (who the building calls) come and make him leave before throwing the possessions he can't carry in the garbage. 

The building's stairwell and lobby are used as temporary shelters by people who may or may not be former tenants and because of this delivery drivers will sometimes refuse to deliver for safety reasons. And it's not a low rent or community housing building. Also, the same man has yelled racist obscenities from his top floor window between 3AM and 6AM for the two years I've been here and management has done nothing, despite complaints from the whole street and multiple visits by police. 

It's a brutal place and we're being farmed for profit by uptown millionaires who are unashamed to declare that they hate poor people. This is Toronto at its worst."
1034,DAH PHAM,WOODSTOCK,"Either her or her sister will come and go, her as she wishes, her sister to clean. Neither live in the house and Dah will only move in so that she can evict who she wants as long as there is no way for her to be harmed. Basement leaks, even after previous poor repairs. Most tenants are decent, those in the house anyway, but the backyard garage, which used to be storage, has a resident who prefers to take as much space as possible and make threats when he doesn't get his way. Has had a history of other difficult tenants as well. The back stairs are not suitable for use to the basement but is all that is available. Dah will change the temperature as she chooses so make sure to check and change that as needed. Threatens to sell the house to every new tenant if they tell her the laws which she says she knows due to being a landlord for 5 years but shows a disturbing disregard for those same laws."
1035,DUNDAS TOMKEN APARTMENTS,MISSISSAUGA,"Long time tenant, saw a change in management in early 2020. Repairs are generally done within 24-48 hours of request. Sometimes promises are made and not kept - in the last 2 years, at different times, we were told we were getting a new washer and refrigerator, but neither happened. Visitor parking is by request (can only send request 9-5, M-F) and often you never get a response. Building maintenance and upkeep are generally good, proactive pest control (mice) and annual fire alarm testing. If everything is good, they only want to enter the unit about twice a year for alarm testing and general maintenance inspection."
1036,BILL,PORT COLBORNE,"This is the worst land lord I have ever had. Nothing ever gets repaired but you can bet your ass you will have a rent increase. I’ve had walls soaked with water and black mold and it took years to get resolved. I’m tired of paying for repairs so when I leave they sure as hell has a ton of work to do. They have gone through 5 supers in 6 years. The parking lot is trash, the response time from bill, the super or th property management company is also trash. I could go on for days."
1037,KAREN DANIEL BURLEIGH,AURORA,"Karen has never read the standard lease. She has no idea what her legal responsibilities are as a landlord and will treat her tenants as a personal chequing account. She tried to scam me for paying more than what is on the lease for utilities and when called out on it she claims that the tenant is the problem. She raised rent by $450 without any formal paperwork indicating what changes were being made to the unit to warrant such a rent increase. I ended my lease early, I wasnt given 60 days notice to move because of her selfishness, she literally slid paperwork under my door saying the unit was being showed for the next prospective tenant."
1038,JASPER FAYER,ORANGEVILLE,"Absolute worst landlord around, owns old buildings and doesn't have funds to repair them or keep them to code. Plays blame games and a constant battle to deal with regarding noise or other tenant complaints"
1039,BERKLEY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"The superintendent and maintenance staff are friendly and responsive. The property manager is no where to be found; however, the assistant property manager, Gisella Velastegui is: rude, presumptuous, and doesn't understand the definition of common courtesy and maintaining tenant privacy. She posts notices on doors containing full tenant information and is less than willful to implement a proper emailing system for building notifications i.e., repairs, renovations, alarms, etc. She will post notice of entry notifications on doors when tenants are away, which undermines applicable legislation for 24-hours' notice. Additionally, she is unresponsive to emails (once quoted, ""Emailing tenants is at my discretion"" and ""Emails are not protocol""--what century is she working in?), noise complaints, and incredibly unclear in her communication when providing directives to tenants. In addition to noise, she does not provide clarity on why garbage and recycling is scheduled for pick up at all hours of the day including early AM on weekends (as early as 6:30 AM). She's been informed the super wheels garbage out of the building at early hours in the morning, which has gone unchanged. The laundry machines smell and often do not work and/or use credits on your chip card. Gisella is narcissistic, does not take accountability for her shortcomings, and gaslighting. Her incompetence is astonishing and it's a miracle that Ridgevest Developments Inc. and Berkley Property Management trust her with this position."
1040,ALLISON ARNOLD,HANOVER/MARKDALE,"Brutal brutal woman. Rented from her for 4 years. Caught her illegally entering, regularly harassed over minor issues but allowed the above neighbour immense leeway with letting her animals defecate within the premises. My utility bill included all exterior outlets lights and common areas as well though she constantly denied it. When my girlfriend moved out she tried to evict me and asked to see my personal bank account to confirm I made enough money to stay, forcing me to give her 3 months in advance to avoid the headache. ALWAYS at the property doing useless work. Makes her 82 year old ex father in law do all of the work in and outside the property or tries to hire tenants. Call police so often over LTB issues our local department will go longer assist her.

Cruel awful woman, tenants started a lawsuit against her so she offered others free months rent if they didn’t join the suit. 
Her own son was screaming at her he would take his work down if she didn’t pay him. 

Renters Beware."
1041,MULTIACE VENTURES INC.,SAULT STE MARIE,"This company, run by 4 high-school friends, is terrible. They are dishonest and tried to swindle us for an extra month of rent when they had rented the place out to someone else already. 
They tried to charge us for repairs they never documented, mentioned, or followed up with us about. 
They tried to keep our last month's rent ad damage deposit, which is against regulations, and only returned what was rightfully ours after I threatened them with legal action after spending hours reviewing the ontario landlord and tenant act. 
This company is terrible and I wouldn't recommend them. They're dishonest, shady, and ill equipped to be landlords."
1042,PROMPTON REAL ESTATE SERVICES CORP.,TORONTO,They just don't care.
1043,SAMANTHA LAL,TORONTO,This is a great place to rent - the view is what sold us and it's close to everything. The landlord was ok. If we needed anything they would look at the request. Any repairs were completed. Furniture delivery was complicated and we had to arrange for the elevator and then the delivery didn't arrive which was a pain. But the company told us we didn't have to be home and they would arrange delivery and they did and videotaped the whole thing and sent it to us! It was a good rental place
1044,NELSON GEORGE,BARRIE,"Stay far away from Nelson George and his wife Tracy! 

Rent is high, place is not registered, will not give you utility bills for months then demand you pay it all at once, will withhold mail, will yell at you, scream at you, threaten you, bang on your door demanding you answer or they will hurt you, will lie to the police, will record you then tell the cops it’s off when it’s not, will say they know the law but do not know anything about it, will demand you move out or they will get the mayor and news over, horrible neighbours who hate them and all tenants, will expect you to watch their kids whenever they need, will tell you you can’t have people over despite it being a completely separate unit covered by the RTA. Have had police come multiple times. They even locked me and my son who is autistic out of the house at midnight and only unlocked it when they saw cops out front. Nelson also owns an illegal business where he takes cars from Toronto and ships them to Nigeria for his apparent mechanic business, but the cars he ships are not his to take. He thinks it is okay to hit women and yell at them and threaten them, and he thinks it’s okay to hit children and yell at them."
1045,CHAOZHENG MA,SCARBOROUGH,Avoid this landlord.
1046,PING FU,WATERLOO,She is a great Landlord and she is so kind and supportive. One of the best Landlord I ever had.
1047,CATHERINE BROOKS,BARRIE,"Catherine was nice at first, but she refused to do any repairs, there was rats living in the vents, she would show up unannounced, and since the unit was not registered, she decided to lie to get us to move out, then refused to pay the 1 month that she was legally required to pay. She then got her brother and step dad to yell at me and threaten me and say that I scared her (I’m a single mom who hates confrontation) and when I told her that she can’t send her brother and step dad after me like that just for me asking about the Money I am owed for an N12, she called the police trying to state that it wasn’t my house when I had my lease and the year wasn’t up yet so I still had 5 months until the N12 said I needed to leave and even though my ID was that address and despite having keys. 

I do not recommend renting from Catherine Brooks, she puts a different name on Kijiji where she posts, but she will scam you and make you move in less than 4 months. I know others that this has happened to as well."
1048,ANGELA FRUSTAGLIO,TORONTO,"This woman has no understanding of landlord tenant law. The place I rented was a legitimate nice home and she did not maintain it. She would show up and want to look around when I was at work and told my children that I gave her permission. They would call me to confirm and the she would argue with me over the phone about just letting her in. 
Utilities were included in the lease and I received a notice to resident of the hydro being cut off for nonpayment. And when I called hydro to advise that I was a tenant in which my lease included utilities my landlord called me to tell me hydro made a mistake. The guy who lived below me told me that when he first moved in the hotwater had been shut off and it took a month to repair. 
When I first moved in I told her about 2 screens that were missing and the entire 2 years I lived there, she never repaired it. The ac broke twice, both times when i first turned it on for the season, I had to argue with her to repair it after she blamed me for breaking it. When the repair man came he told me that it has needed to be replaced for several years and she calls every year for a quick fix that he advises after the fix would stop working again. When I moved in the place was filthy and was not cleaned and she would not let me pay for someone to come in and clean before I moved in even after offering to pay per diem rent for the few days before so the cleaners could come in. The place was vacant.
Overall she was constantly argumentative, pushy, rude and insulting. I am in the legal field and I would constantly  advise her of my rights as a tenant and her responsibilities as a landlord and I can't be bullied. 
It is obvious that she bullies tenants and me standing up to her escalated her behaviour. She made living in that place a nightmare. I do not recommend anyone rent from her, with the type of rental she has and the cost of it, you could easily find a better place without unnecessary hassles."
1049,BOARDWALK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"The on site staff are great, from landscaping, maintenance, cleaners, and in the office.
The company is another story, upper management has shown disrespect, been rude, and dismissive with me and other tenants."
1050,FAR INVESTMENTS,TORONTO,"People are going to take shots at Far Investments.  I lived at ****** and the people helping run the building were in an easily accessible and visible office practically every day.    It's an OK building and if something goes wrong with the unit, they're usually really good at fixing things up.  

I didn't have any bug problems.  I moved because of the noise from all the construction in the area, otherwise i would have stayed there."
1051,EQUITON,HAMILTON,Equiton is the worst  mice rats garbage cockroaches bedbugs lack of hot water or even water close their eyes  CEO should be ashamed of himself and his company all they care about is gouging their tenants for money increasing rent over AGI without doing anything. Broken elevators doors pipes walls the list goes on and on.  Horrible property management staff
1052,ANTHONY MIKLAUCIC,TORONTO,"Tony is a good-spirited guy, but he is extremely lazy, slow to respond to messages, and it is extremely difficult to get him to physically come to the property to address concerns. I'll see him twice or three times a year if I'm lucky. Like many landlords, he will choose the cheapest possible contractors to solve his problems, which doesn't have the greatest results. At this point, it seems like he is just trying to make money off of renting his properties until they crumble apart. It often seems as if he procrastinates and gives little concern to the problems of his tenants as a passive-aggressive way of getting them to move out of their own accord, so that he can get new tenants in for a higher rental agreement. He also does not properly vet his tenants before signing agreements with them, resulting in extremely poor choices and disrespectful neighbours/tenants sharing the same property."
1053,KEVIN LEE,OTTAWA,"Did next to none of the repairs requested over the two and a half years I've lived here. Has come into my apartment without notice. Has suggested I get rid of my medical therapy pet. Is currently ""renovicting"" to do the repairs he's been saying he'd deal with since I moved in."
1054,GRANT A. OLDRIEVE,OWEN SOUND,"Places are full of mold, no maintenance done. Cosmetic cover ups of serious problems. I would stay away from his rentals."
1055,CHRIS REID,SCARBOROUGH,"Chris started out as a decent landlord, however as time progressed got worse and worse. He raised rent illegally (by percentage allowed as well as time frame. raised 10% with a couple months notice, and tried to raise it another 12% less than 6 months later.), took months to fix issues in the apartment, unless they directly impacted him/his investment. He consistently pried into my personal life, and would yell and threaten evictions if he was mad."
1056,BOOKER'S PROPERTIES,SUDBURY,"Very respectful landlord, property is maintained and rules are followed.  I would rent from Luke and Shelly again!"
1057,KADIE STEWART,ST CATHARINES,"Kadie right off the bat compared her mortgage to our son dying (son died right before we moved in so she was very aware of the sitch)
Threatened to proceed with eviction because we told her we would be a week or 2 late on rent because we had just paid off the funeral and then JUST gotten into a car crash.
Was asking her for understanding & kindness & was met with disrespect.
She doesn't do any maintenance, that's her husband Maxwell. He's much nicer than her.
I have talked to 3 other tenants of hers & all don't like her & have problems with her.
She treats all of us with 0 respect. Makes it known it's HER houses & that we just stay here. Never gives any official notices for repairs which is illegal & has threatened to sue us for asking her to do her job :)"
1058,EQUITON,HAMILTON,Disgusting
1059,HANNAH PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"They applied, and were approved to add 2 additional floors on our existing building.  The construction caused more than 1 flood with caused extensive damage to multiple units.  We had no working elevator for almost 7 months, insulation, wood and other building items were left in hallways and stairwells.  Wires were left hanging from the ceilings.  There were multiple tripping hazards in hallways.  We currently have mice, which was reported a week ago and we've still not received notice about when the exterminator will be coming.  All this, and they raised our rent."
1060,NMR PROPERTIES / MARY SHECHTMAN,TORONTO,"Avoid NMR Properties at all costs! I lived in a unit that flooded multiple times over many years and they couldn’t be bothered to ever change out the carpet which covered most of the unit. I’m talking SOPPING wet. It ended up extremely moldy. The property manager was disrespectful, illegally entered unit on several occasions, threatened people and nearly never repaired anything in the many years I lived there. When repairs were made it was clear he didn’t know what he was doing. They made a near fatal mistake in attempting to repair a toxic exhaust and ended up pointing it into the house where young children lived. The landlord is a VERY rich woman (billions) and can’t even spend a dime improving the lives of the people who line her pockets. Stay. Away."
1061,PARTH,LYN,"I moved into this apartment 7 months ago been after my landlord parth to fix a list of things and I'm am still waiting. The heaters are falling off the walls, back door dont close, bathrooms window have holes inside, floors not installed right, bathtub has cracks and holes, bathroom lights need electrical work, windows has no locks using blocks of wood to lock them and front door can be pushed open with 1 finger when fully closed. I have sent him pictures and videos of all of this and still nothing is being done."
1062,CITADEL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT GROUP INC,TORONTO,I rented an apartment for 2.5 years from this company in downtown Toronto. Great to communicate with and had a great relationship throughout my time at the apartment. They were incredibly quick to repair or deal with anything. When I told them I was planning on finding a larger place with my partner they wanted to help so they showed me all the units they had available within what I wanted. I ended up going to a different place - but they gave me an excellent reference to help me secure it. Would definitely rent from them again.
1063,EMELIO,PETERBOROUGH,"I signed a lease on a napkin (my bad I know) but I looked into and the legal clinic said my etransfer a were evidence of rent payment and that was okay. 

However he didn’t know that last but and so tried to take advantage. He is a bus driver for the city and he is married. 
It didn’t stop him from coming to the property regularly with no notice. 
He walked in without knocking and it ended up being mainly when I was showering or naked. It looked like he had gotten to know my schedule. I had two kids, single mom. It was only 1000$ rent and it is very hard to find housing in Peterborough so I ended up getting a dog to keep him from walking in. It worked but he didn’t want me having a dog. 
Clearly. 

He got worse after he got better and I didn’t know I could call the cops for this. I ended up moving out and I called the cops during my last month because he was coming every day at that point. The cops had to tell him to knock it off or they would arrest him .
I believe he owns other properties now.
He sold that unit now, but I thought I’d put out a warning to others."
1064,GUARDIAN,SARNIA,Never recommend
1065,AMU DETLOR,OSHAWA,"Fabulous landlord.  Always repairs items as they come up quickly.  

Gives plenty of notice when coming to do repairs."
1066,AMU DETLOR,OSHAWA,"We lived in the house with bedbugs for over a year and the landlord would not hire someone to get rid of them. Landlord would get other tenants to go into eachothers rooms when we weren't home to take pictures or just do through our stuff. Landlord would have other tenants stand outside of bedroom doors and listen in on what others would talk about. As well as constantly bringing in known dealers and users, taking they're first and last months rent then kicking them our after 2 weeks and keep the money."
1067,CLV GROUP / INTERRENT REIT,HAMILTON,"Company has not addressed or attempted to improve the parking & parking lot situation. Not enough parking spaces & the parking spaces that are present aren’t properly sized. Anytime it rains the parking lot becomes flooded. Homeless people have been living on the ground floor of the parking garage because it has been in a state of disrepair for 5+ years. They won’t create accessible parking spaces when requested (simple coat of paint on asphalt) - this is legally required and yet they still refuse to abide by the law to make the tenant comfortable.

And on top of all of this Building management threatens you that they will ticket and tow your vehicle if it isn’t parked in a designated spot, even though there aren’t enough for the tenants."
1068,BRUCE GLASSFORD,NORTH BAY,Highly recommend renting from him:) he is wonderful! Takes all concerns/complaints seriously and deals with them right away. When repairs are needed he gets guys in ASAP to fix it. Always gives us entry notice. Even having crappy neighbours he treats us very well and is always very helpful!
1069,JIM STEWART,NORTH BAY,Repairs never got done. We had to do ourselves. Our windows were boarded up for the entire time we ranted because they were broke during construction. Never got fixed. Ransoms walking into a “locked secure” building all the time. Homeless men sleeping outside of our door. Our neighbours kids walked in our apartment several times while we were home and would stand outside our door yelling. Landlord never cared about those complaints. We paid for a neighbour to charge their Tesla for 6 months because he said our 600$ bill was normal. 1 bedroom jail cell on main st.
1070,JERUDAN DEVELOPMENTS,EASTYORK,"Zero Security , Disrespectful Property Manager , Doesn't repair complaint unit"
1071,OTTAWA COMMUNITY HOUSING,OTTAWA,"They don't even post their postal code because they are tired of complaints. They only painted part of the wall when you move in. The bottom 12 inches isn't repainted. Repairs can take ages and if you report online they deactivate the button so that you can't report. They create work orders for your unit that never happen or exist. They do not enforce their own policies and threaten people who ask them too. OCH places bug bait on top of bug bait. You will have 20 years of bug bait dried and stuck to your cabinets. The bait is for ants, cockroaches, and watch out for bed bugs! They are in the laundry rooms. The hallways are never fully cleaned for over months. Tenants will be anywhere from a retired senior to drug addicted 16 year olds. All with no support, the building's support offices are employed by people who don't want to work or ex addicts who are tempted by what is around them.
Low income housing is not safe"
1072,SHIPLAKE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Tries to use above-guideline rent increases to increase rent after small renovation (paint the hallways, redo the lobby) but overall a decent company."
1073,TEDDIE LOHRENZ,PETERBOROUGH,"Repairs that should have taken minutes to complete were done over the course of years

Threatens arbitrary evictions when they get upset

They live on the property and are loud, messy, with very poor personal hygiene 

Some rooms for rent do not have light or heat

Rent and utilities are arbitrary assigned to each tenant

Overall an extremely unpleasant experience"
1074,XINDE XIA,TORONTO,"Xinde Xia owns a number of properties in the Swansea area and he is running them into the ground. 60 Coe Hill Drive is in awful condition, with leaks, bad wiring, cockroaches and black mold. When we notify Xinde of these issues he usually ignores us. On the rare occasion that he does a repair, he attempts to do it himself and refuses to hire professionals even in emergencies (such as leaving us without a washer, stove or even running water for days and weeks at a time). He also rents the driveway, garage and backyard sheds to other people so there are strangers in our space every day. He uses low rent to lure vulnerable people like newcomers who don't know tenant rights."
1075,SHANNON WALLS BRINNON HOLDINGS,KITCHENER,"This landlord refused to fix rodent issues, gave another tenant a key to my unit to “flip the breaker” which resulted jn a creepy drunk guy in my living room while i was at home trying to sleep.  She has no respect and threatened to evict me because i wanted the rodent issued fixed"
1076,OPUS 84,SCARBOROUGH,Never had a problem and always great to deal with
1077,PEARTREE,OTTAWA,"This property group was by far the best landlords I’ve had. It was a small building but anytime we needed repairs they were done quickly, as a shift worker they were flexible with when they came to do standard work (fire alarm batteries) when the building was sold I was sad to see them leave."
1078,MALLIKA PETER,OTTAWA,Mallika was an absolutely awful landlord. She was constantly at our place tending to the garden while trying to look into our windows. She failed to give 24 hour notice multiple times and entered our home without permission. We gave our 60 days notice and she tried to scam us for money for leaving the apartment “dirty” even after we hired a cleaning company to clean the unit before we left. We were respectful and quiet tenants and always did our own small repairs but still she tried to scam us for money after we left and told us that she would go to the tenant board if we did not pay her 125 dollars to “clean” the apartment. Absolutely disgusting woman. Do not rent from her.
1079,IRIS BEACH,COLDWATER,Iris Beach and Linda Beach. Was the most careless landlord I've ever met her units are disgusting I had to clean and renovate myself to be able to move in. Found out a year after paying insane hdro bills $600 a month for a two bedroom apartment that the whole building was run into my meter after moving out they harassed me and family slum lord of Coldwater
1080,"SARAH DEYONG, TDL MANAGEMENT",TORONTO,"An absolute nightmare. She has taken over from her brother who originally managed the building for 20+ years, and within one year the entire building hated her. She has given everyone an eviction notice, threatens to evict tenants over $5, leaves units that are lived in, in states of chaos for repairs for months, calls the police on tenants and neighbours for “harassment” with 11pm at night authority visits for questioning, charges tenants $5k or more for building damages that existed before the tenants even lived there, refuses to provide parking on the property, refuses to issue keys to the building to all tenants, ignores safety concern requests of the property, ripped out the internet cables forcing all tenants to cancel their internet services and go with a more expensive service providers, the list goes on. We have had to contract a couple of lawyers to go through eviction hearings, and fight for our rights as tenants against Sarah Deyong. Multiple complaints sent to the city for bylaw violations. Some tenants have lived in the building for 20 years or more and it was a very peaceful building with very respectful tenants. Luckily for us, this whole situation has made the buildings community closer, but nothing is worth living in constant stress due to the landlords actions and disrespect."
1081,HARTSFORD PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"I understand that this is a 55+ apartment building. We have a number of tenants with walkers, canes, etc. After a power outage, the elevator is often not available, and we have to wait for a few days before a technician comes to reset it. It is a three-storey building with one small elevator which takes 3 minutes to travel from the basement to the third floor. We are also not allowed to use this elevator for moving. Understandable considering its size and type. Meant primarily for wheelchair access. Recently, the Lobby Intercom System was not operating. Deliveries were unable to contact individuals to tell them their delivery was there or, if they phoned, they had to go down to get the packages, heavy or not, by themselves. It was very inconvenient and took from April 5 to April 22 to be rectified. It took a month for someone to fix a broken dryer vent in my apartment. The landlord has just advised us to remove all belongings from the balcony if possible, so they can clean the windows. I can clean our windows easier and faster than it will take me to remove all belongings. There does not appear to be any compassion from this company."
1082,METCAP,TORONTO,"There is absolutely no maintenance, they don't clean hallways regularly and let homeless people enter the building and roam around freely. Pest control is not done properly and cockroaches comes back all the time."
1083,BOARDWALK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"I rented from Boardwalk Properties a few years ago and it was the most horrible experience I ever went through. Whenever it rained my basement would leak and flood. Water would literally stream down the walls and I would have inches of water on the floor- I can’t count the number of times I had to call their head office in Alberta bc the property manager in my area would no longer take my calls. After MONTHS of calling and threatening legal action they repaired the exterior bricks (which only fixed part of the problem) and then MANY more months later they had a sump pump installed. I finally had enough of living there and bought my own house. 3 months after purchasing my house I found out that my old neighbor had a really bad case of bedbugs, which Boardwalk knew and didn’t tell anyone else, and I brought them with me to my new home. Bc I had no warning I wasn’t looking for bedbugs and by the time I realized I had them it cost me a fortune to exterminate. 
The new tenants to my old unit reached out to me and told me that they wished they never moved into that place bc the old pipes burst and ruined so much of their things. 
Also every time the maintenance guy would come over my cat would hiss and get upset- he never did this with anyone else in his 17yrs alive- I’m almost positive that guy hurt my cat when I wasn’t home. 
I could go on and on about how horrible they were but you get the idea."
1084,HASTI KCH,NEWMARKET,"Installed cameras to watch our movements, illegal basement apartment and nothing is up to code. Kicked us out in three months because she didn’t like the push back to get the apartment fixed up, threatened to move her sister in to legally kick us out. Kept in touch with the rental and found out she did the same thing to the next tenants. Her friends are the “handymen” that come in whenever they decide to show up and they definitely don’t understand the legal requirements of an apartment."
1085,CHERRY  ISAACS,KING CITY,"Absolutely disgusting and terrible landlord and person. Rent out her property with roof damage, unsanitary water, broken windows. She never cleaned up her driveway and made me pay extra 150$ for parking ( her driveway could fit 12 cars). She refused to give me a mailbox keys so I did not got an access to my mail. She was also trying to increase my rent in the middle of the year, just because she wanted so.
 Dishonest, rude, obnoxious and just absolutely terrible LIAR."
1086,CANDICE LEVINE,TORONTO,A really lovely person and I really enjoyed being her tenant.
1087,LISA & KURT SCHUETT,GUELPH,"Always quick to reply if any issues with home.  House was clean, freshly painted and carpets cleaned before move in.  Would highly recommend these landlords they truly seem to care about their tenants and their properties"
1088,DUBRICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"Dubrick is the type of management that will just mind their own business. They don’t bother you very much but they are also VERY slow to address any concerns that you have. When we moved in they told us that they would be updating the windows by the end of the year and we are going on year 2 and nothing. Also any time we ask for any repairs they basically tell us that because of COVID everything is on back order and therefore they never get to anything. 

One thing I do appreciate is that they mind their own business and are not bothering the tenants all of the time."
1089,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"I would say York is a fairly middle of the road rental company, UNTIL there’s a major issue. Despite knowing our boiler which heated three buildings of apartment’s was down in the summer of 2022, we were without heat well into December. While York did bring us space heaters and eventually offer us a rent reimbursement it didn’t make up for the logistics of living through a cold fall and early winter with no heat. The worst part was when we finally heard back from a York rep after many unanswered phone calls and messages they claimed quote “they didn’t know we were cold.” At the end of the day you’re always just going to be a number to a company like this, and even when they’re doing something illegal you have very little recourse. We still live here because we love the building and our neighbors, but this situation really showed us York’s true colours. I wouldn’t necessarily discourage someone from renting from them because on the daily they’re perfectly fine as far as any landlord goes, but just be warned that doesn’t mean they care about their tenants."
1090,ALAA YOUSIF (LIMITLESS PROPERTY OR HC PROPERTY),ST CATHARINES,"Unsure where to even begin with these guys. Removal of garbage services, threatening of fines if we dispose our garbage in the provided bins, a rent increase of 17.5%, zero communication and weeks for response, superintendent lives on site who does *nothing* but fight with girlfriend.
These guys are trash and would never recommend renting from them."
1091,SEAN RAPPITT,ST CATHARINES,"Overall a good landlord. Didn't raise our rent in 5 years, pretty responsive for repairs. There were a few times he essentially said ""not my problem"" to repairs but repaired everything legally required."
1092,MORGUARD,TORONTO,Amazing people work there and they really do care.
1093,UNIVERSAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"They still haven’t done anything about the ants in our apartment, and now there is a report of cockroaches which they should be doing a preventative in each apartment to contain them from spreading."
1094,BAYSHORE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,ORILLIA,Very nice property management company.  Have always been a pleasure to deal with
1095,DAN KAPELUS,TORONTO,"Dan is fine. But obviously out to make money. There was black mold in a cupboard and he told us to just put bleach on it. My roommate had a stuffy nose pretty much the entire time we lived there and it cleared up once we moved out. It also flooded once during a freak storm, he and his wife were very concerned and offered to put us up but didn’t agree that the fact that since the eaves trough was draining into the sump pump it was overflowing into the basement. As soon as I redirected it to the street mains we stopped flooding. That whole underground set up wasn’t proper. He also amends the Ontario Lease so you have to leave a day earlier so they can clean which I don’t think is legal. Look out for that. Places look nice but are over priced slapped together ikea. But that’s Toronto for you."
1096,SIGNET PROPERT MANAGEMENT,WOODSTOCK,"This is a slum and they are slum lords. The doors entering the building are not secured and literally anyone can walk into the buildings. There are no cameras, no safety whatsoever. I’ve had multiple bikes stolen. The refuse to deal with the fact that other renters and maintenance crews smoke in the hallways and directly outside of the doorways, and randomly change policies about parking, etc. without any organization or rationale.

The hallways haven’t been cleaned in six months and the superintendents don’t respond to any communication, I cannot recommend avoiding a signet property enough."
1097,ANNA GRENDYS,TORONTO,She doesn’t respond to anyone. Raises rent randomly.
1098,CHELSEA APARTMENTS,OTTAWA,"They do not do repairs or even basic maintenance. Tenants have had to call bylaw because the landlord ignores complaints about water leaks, heat being out, windows being broken (separate instances) for so long. Buildings don't get cleaned, lawns don't get mowed. Very little has been updated since the original build. Washing machines are being held together with spit and grease and will ruin your clothes. If they finally decide to show up and repair something they do not give any notice. Just come in whenever is convenient for them. There is no emergency line to contact. No one answers their office phone. But they never forget to send out the annual rent increases!"
1099,RIOCAN,THORNHILL,Huge corporation that moves very slowly. Tremendous arrogance. Not invested in tenants success
1100,EQUITY BUILDERS,MISSISSAUGA,Terrible with repairs and emergencies aren't event delt with as an emergency.
1101,SAMBOR ROOFING,GUELPH,"During the winter, the apartments were freezing. Tenants posted notices in the foyer to call and make complaints, so clearly it wasn’t just my unit. 
Landlord stated that they were waiting for repairs on the heating unit however this was only noted weeks after I (and others) made a request to check the heating and after others posted the notice in foyer - highly believe landlord was trying to save on money and there was no issue with the system. No space heaters or rebates were provided. 
Being above a bar, the building also has cockroaches. The old landlord called pest control however once Sambor took over Sambor did nothing despite the request. 
Since Sambor took over, the building foyer and hallways became increasingly filthy. Garbage strewn all over and never cleaned up. 
They do not respond to emails and do not take their tenants concern’s seriously. 
The building is not at all safe and has had non-residents roaming the hallways while either tripping out on serious drugs or having a psychotic break. 
Hallways stink like cigarettes and pot although the building is supposed to be no smoking. 
Not suitable for students/females."
1102,TAM BACH,KITCHENER,Tam was incredibly disrespectful after taking over management from our landlord. He is entirely unprofessional and does not care about respecting renters rights. Landlords and tenants should avoid.
1103,ALYZZA B,HAILEYBURY,"This particular landlord really tries to be accomodating to their tenants especially since we're all students.

She messages us to ket us know when and why she needs to come to the house or enter our rooms (since I dont like strangers barging in my room).

They're very neutral when it comes to their tenants and only intervenes when us tenants cant solve the problem ourselves."
1104,JOHN FROM METCAP,OSHAWA,"You and the company are the worst kinds of human beings there is. The owners who not only take advantage of their tenants and their rights, YOU JOHN go out of your way to make sure they can. You're litterally their right hand in screwing us over, and when I called you on it you denied it like you had no idea what happened. 
You and the company are robbers. Whole building is infested with roaches and ants, you guys do nothing about that either.

666 king st east oshawa should be torn down"
1105,PARK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"They took over the apartment buildings from the previous owner, and make a decent attempt to find something to remove longer standing tenants. Repair requests go unanswered. You HAVE to leave a voicemail, you can never talk to a real person. They nickel and dine you for everything."
1106,SHANE SZETO,TORONTO,"I actually moved from this location about a year or so ago (was moving in with my partner and wanted something bigger) but still felt compelled to hop on this to write something positive about the landlord here.

It was very much a case of ideal landlord. He was always incredibly easy to work with, communication was fantastic, and the price was decent for what it was.

Would fully recommend and commend him as a landlord."
1107,WESTDALE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"They keep a nice clean well maintained building, at least at mine."
1108,BARB MCINROY,LONDON,"I had a great experience renting from Barb, I lived there for 6 or 7 years and referred a couple people to rent other units (and they had good experiences too!). It's an older building but repairs and upkeep are prioritized and taken seriously. Rent is reasonable and communication is always quick and respectful. I would absolutely rent from her again. My only (mild) complaint is difficulty receiving packages, as the mailbox is inside the building and carriers can't always get in."
1109,HOMESTEAD,NORTH YORK,The worst Super I’ve ever seen is this woman name Ara at 225 Van Horne Ave.  North York.
1110,DMI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC,MISSISSAUGA,"Absolutely horrible experience living in the property at 65 Park st E, mississauga. Roaches, roberry in the garage, mold in the bathrooms and exploding walls, and only if you fix the apartment  yourself then you can have good living conditions. Otherwise, no one from the management will lift a finger."
1111,ORCHARD PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,"This company does nothing in our building just come collect money…. There’s been cockroaches everywhere….. we don’t even have full time superintendent to clean and deal with emergencies, this company has only been here 7-8 yrs and it’s a nightmare ever since. We have to pay for storage and can only get in there when they say so not convenient at all. Our safery is a concern also because locks for main doors getting in the building have been broken for days already has been ppl sleeping in stairwells. The elevator has been out while we only have 1 elevator. Now the latest thing their trying to get away with is changing ppl for freezers and air conditioning at outrageous costs as we don’t have meters they are just making up prices. I’ve been here almost 30 years never had to pay these things. 40$ for freezer and 80$ for air conditioning ."
1112,MINTO,LONDON,"The longer you’re a resident, the less they care. Waited months for bathroom repairs. Waiting weeks for pest control. But they are quick to request entry to fix problems that don’t apply to your unit. The units are not really updated. Just fake floors."
1113,TORBILL HOLDINGS,BELLEVILLE,"I moved into one of Torbills many buildings in October of 2022.. I pay my rent on time my unit is always clean we've always been respectful of the office staff until recently when they stated harassing us giving my personal information to others who didn't live in my unit or on my lease. They falsified N5's. Their buildings are run down, court yards are wither covered in dog poop or garbage. Hallways smell of animal feces and maintenance is never done! It's an okay spot if you need somewhere quick till you can find something better but definitely not a forever home!"
1114,BCIMC REALTY CORP (MISSISSAUGA PLACE,MISSISSAUGA,Building is old and constantly locking of essential services such as water. Landlord focuses on aesthetics and call it capital expenditure to get higher than normal rent increase yet invest very little effort and money into maintaining the old infrastructure to minimize disruption in essential services
1115,G AND S REGAL,SCARBOROUGH,"This is the worst people to rent from. They deliberately don’t fix anything as a way to get old tenants out. They frustrate their tenants and lie at the LTB as if they have people in there. Liars , cheap owners they never want to do anything and they lie so much to get their way. Cheap old fridge that is over 40 years old toilets old and walls stink of nasty wet mould. They will never test their dirty walls for nasty mould but they will totally lie against anyone."
1116,MARGARITA HO,TORONTO,"Margarita is elderly, lonely and unwell and is not capable of keeping up with the property. Her kids accept the rent but don’t get involved in tenant issues. She views tenants and guests in her home. She disappears for months but when she decides to get involved she has serious boundary issues. She puts unenforceable clauses in her leases. I managed ok by setting firm expectations and boundaries about when and how she can communicate and enter the unit to do repairs. The basics/emergency repairs were done but she’s cheap and always complaining about how expensive everything is. The building is safe but be clear about your needs and expectations, make sure everything is in writing, and refer to the RTA and landlord obligations."
1117,"TIM MCKINNEY, REMAX",BELLEVILLE,"Tim is the best landlord we've ever had.  Very respectful, and responds to any messages promptly.  Repairs are done in a timely manner when needed.  A dream to deal with."
1118,GRAHAM HEIT,KITCHENER,Attentive to maintenance needs and respected our privacy.
1119,SABBIR SHAH,SCARBOROUGH,"Started renting from him in April of last year everything was going well until we needed repairs. He refused to fix mould in our bathroom still hasn’t been fixed to this day. We don’t have a door separating us from the upstairs tenants. They have access all the time to our apartment, he has yet to address that he has entered our unit without permission, or letting us know before hand shows up at the property whenever he feels like it with his family, had our gas shut off because he didn’t pay the bill threats to my dog, and to my life went to court had a plan drawn out and then the last minute he cancelled on it so we stop paying rent and will refuse to pay him ever. He is a piece of garbage steer clear of 19 Green Ash Terrace."
1120,CLOPARK MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Renovicted long term tenants and jacked up the rent when the building was remodelled. Mass-emailed tenants threatening letters during COVID saying if anyone was late on rent at all they would immediately move to evict and report to the credit bureau to ruin your credit. There was a news story about this (Google it!) and the MPP Marit Stiles got involved to advocate for tenants.

Beyond the disrespectful and illegal business practices, the apartments are also in terrible condition (despite looking cosmetically nice, it's all just a band-aid to distract from structural issues) and they are notoriously terrible about repairs.

Be prepared for tons of roaches and mice. It was like pulling teeth to get repairs done and they would hire cheap unqualified people who didn't ever actually solve the problems. Appliances are cheap and break. I was without a fridge for over a month. 

The ""pest control"" they hired for cockroaches just sprayed RAID where the roaches were visible, they'd move to another unit, then come back. The prior superintendent told me they'd had roaches in the building at least 15 years, sometimes so bad that they opened their oven and a cloud of black was inside. Clopark / Shalini & corefused to hire an actual professional company so the problem never goes away. Nasty."
1121,KANEFF PROPERTIES,MISSISSAUGA,"There are no onsite superintendents 
There is no 24 hour contact
The upkeep is nonexistent 
They have shut down facilities and taken away free visitor parking .
Despite all of this they continue to unreasonably increase rent when units become vacant 
They should be ashamed of themselves"
1122,KERNISHA BAIRD,BRANTFORD,"Not only did she try entering our home unlawfully, but she took pictures and then shared with her church the ""animals"" living in her rental. She was racist, sexist and manipulative. She also neglected to tell me that both units were on one meter so I was paying hydro and gas for 2 units and when I asked for reimbursement she served me an eviction notice. When I refused to leave, she posted my car for sale so that I had strangers coming to my home all day and night trying to get into my car to see if it was right for them. We found somewhere better and moved but even then she had men coming to my home trying to help themselves to my property and harassing the movers.......I'm a single mother, I was living in constant fear from the second I moved in. She was fined for not having a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector in the home and is actively trying to take me to court stating that I should be the one providing those in the unit. It's a tiny place, not worth more than $1000 a month but she has it priced out at 2300 plus utilities for both units. We escaped domestic violence the previous year and once she realized that, she threatened me any my children that she was going to help him find us and give us the beating we deserve. The stories are endless. We were in hell. Don't rent from her!"
1123,MICHAEL LEWIS,TORONTO,"Avoid at all costs. Rented apartment at 1046 Bathurst. Refused to do anything for years about ongoing pest (mice and bedbugs) infestations. Does not perform even basic repairs such as roof leaking. Has illegally evicted multiple tenants claiming he needs to move into their units, then turned around and rented them out to new tenants for 30%+ higher rent."
1124,THE GOOD TENANT FACTORY,ORILLIA,"This landlord does not respect her tenants, period."
1125,LV PROPERTIES INC,WINDSOR,"Lynn Crumb is probably one of the most insufferable people I've ever met. The place could be worse I suppose. I had the misfortune of renting an apartment from Lynn, and I have to say it was an absolute nightmare. When I moved in, the apartment was dirty and clearly hadn't been cleaned properly. The floors were sticky, the bathroom was grimy, and there were even old food crumbs left in the drawers. Despite bringing this to the attention of my ex-landlord, nothing was done to improve the situation. To make matters worse, every single repair that needed to be done was done cheaply, with shoddy workmanship that barely held up. My ex-landlord refused to allow us to do our own repairs with our own money, so we had to settle for subpar living conditions. The hallway of the building also smelled horrible, and there was little to no effort made to address the issue. To top it all off, the ""property manager"" Dave was a lying weasel who made promises they never intended to keep. It was impossible to trust anything they said, and I always felt like I was being taken advantage of. Overall, I would strongly advise against renting from LV Properties or any of their properties. The living conditions were unacceptable, and the property manager was downright deceitful. This is 6490 Wyandotte St. E. I suppose it could be much worse like the other apartments around the area."
1126,SCOTT GANSON,KITCHENER,Prompt at responding when contacted with questions or concerns. Friendly and accommodating. Pays close attention to things happening in the building (the rented unit is a condo he owns).
1127,CC & ASSOCIATES,TORONTO,Very low integrity. Will try everything to get you to move and get more money. Harassment is endless. The location and rent are reasonable only because I know the laws.
1128,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,The building is maintained and you can get people to do work in your unit when necessary. They send confusing and false information when they seek an above guideline rent increase. It's also difficult to know who to speak with for a particular issue. The contact list are confusing and out of date.
1129,SAMUEL BAICHOO,WALLACEBURG,"Our landlord is one of the worst he left us without heat for two years family of 7 he harasses us, left us without the second toilet and a leaking roof as well as shingles flying all over the yard and the eaves trough falling off the house not being repaired the stairs are a death trap the entire house is falling apart and he does nothing"
1130,HOUSING CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"We were lucky to move into our home and at first pay very little rent as it’s geared to income. We now pay full market rent and it’s still half the price of what other people are pay.

The outside is kept very nice and they constantly have people here to take care of the landscaping, fences, garbage etc.

Our location and who manages our location is amazing."
1131,RANBIR SINGH,ETOBICOKE,Shittiest landlord I have ever had. He had a history of molesting one female tenant and only favours those female tenants who lick his ass. He had increased my rent twice within one month. The basement had no legal windows and had moulds. I would never recommend this place to anyone especially Indian students.
1132,FRANCIS RENTALS INC,WINDSOR,"Honestly, I wish I could say worse. They only ""repaired"" some things because I would have been able to call the LTB. They're impossible to get a hold of. I was finally able to get their direct address through some internet stalking. The place is a ""beautiful dump"". ""New furnishings,"" they say. What they don't tell you is that the previous tenants ruined the already shitty place. I can't wait to move out. The fact that you can never get a hold of anyone is absurd. Windows falling because they aren't properly seated. The sliding door screen was broken when we moved in. The list goes on. I stopped inquiring on their online portal because the only way I would get an answer is if I kept spamming asking for a repair."
1133,R.R,KESWICK,"The landlord of this property is absent, and we deal with a property manager instead. Despite bringing up concerns about the roof when we moved in three years ago, we have not seen any action taken to address the issue. Workers have shown up unannounced and without performing any repairs, leaving us frustrated and concerned. Now, we are dealing with a raccoon invasion in our roof that still hasn't been addressed.

Additionally, there are several other maintenance issues that have not been resolved. When we first moved in, we were promised a professional cleaning and painting, but the contractors left a huge mess that we had to clean up ourselves. The window frames are rotting, and the dock is damaged and unusable. We were disappointed to learn that the landlord considers this an ""old"" property and is not willing to invest in necessary repairs.

Furthermore, the contractors hired to paint our deck were careless and caused damage to our patio table, patio stones, and my boyfriend's car. It's frustrating to pay good money to live here and receive such poor treatment from our landlord and their team. This property appears to be nothing more than an investment, with no real concern for the tenants who live here.

Overall, we are tired of landlords neglecting their properties and their tenants. We deserve better treatment and a safe, well-maintained place to call home."
1134,SEAN GIRDUCKIS,BELLEVILLE,Sean should probably stick to being a fake doctor.
1135,CINDY (FANG) HE,WOODBRIDGE,"The house is beautiful and very clean. Unfortunately, the lady landlord (who lives in the same renting house) is crazy. If you rent a room in the house, be careful not to be too nice or talk to her a lot. She will start asking you to convert to Christianity, and constantly bash other religions. She will accuse you of the things you do not do in the house or accuse you of being evil because you do not follow her religion and did not know God or have God to guide you. This lady is very ignorant and disrespectful. She will yell at you for this or that (if something happened in the house) even you do not do it, she has a camera installed in the living room facing the kitchen area (to watch you), she will always say God knows all when she accuses you of random shits. She is controlling too. And she studies bible everyday but has an affair with her best friend, the big Jewish man living in the same neighborhood “Harry” while her husband is away in Quebec. Do not move in if you do not want extra stress and bullshit things."
1136,2693433 ONTARIO LTD.,ST. CATHARINES,"Great family run property company for communal living in St. Catharines Ontario. Communicates well , repairs done whenever something goes wrong and have never had any specific problems with them."
1137,GREG SHANNON,OTTAWA,"Please beware of Greg Shannon of Petawawa. Where to begin. First off he does his own repair and doesn't hire professionals to get the job done right. I had to take care of mice infestation on my own. I had to to deal with sewage back up seeping in the basement which was a health risk, it smelt of feces in the basement. Greg didn't take any of my concerns seriously. He came down and mopped the mess himself and didn't even get a professional to assess the issue. I had to hire my own guy to make sure all the feces were properly removed and painted over. Then he has the gall to weaponize the Landlord and Tenant board tribunal against me. He also negated on a rent reduction that we both agreed on in writing. Then when I moved out he claimed I owed him in back rent. So now he has a judgment against me by the biased LTB for thousands of dollars. I NEVER LIVED RENT FREE AND PAID MY OWN RENT AND PAID FOR REPAIRS OUT OF POCKET YET THE LTB SIDES WITH HIM. He is punishing me because he knew the Landlord and Tenant Board would side with him as he is known to them. Almost like they're in cahoots with eachother. Lastly, he broke into my home and set off the alarm. Police came and found no one. My neighbour got so scared she took a picture of him fleeing. THE OTTAWA POLICE SIDE WITH HIM AFTER I REPORTED HIM A DOZEN TIMES. This man is a danger to all tenants. If you rent from him he will weaponize the LTB against you and is cozy with the Ottawa police services!!! Your rights are not there. I'm a single mom and he seems to rent to people who are poor and with no support from friends and family. I just am trying to live a decent life raising my kids living pay cheque to pay cheque, paying rent on time yet he ignored and disrespected me which left me infuriated and frustrated for the first time in my life. He really did affect my mental health because renting from this man has made me feel unsafe, unheard and my rights completely ripped apart by the Landlord and Tenant Board and the Ottawa Police Services. So much so I moved to the US to live closer to family. Canada and especially Ontario allows the rich to do whatever they want to the little people. Greg Shannon has abused his landlord status and every TENANT WILL GET HARASSED, UNFAIRLY SUED because he knows how to work the system as a slumlord, he will manipulate the LTB and law enforcement to get his own way and of course bogus judgment orders. He did tell me if moving day that he did sue his previous tenants, so this is a pattern: RENT, PAY RENT, MOVE OUT, GET SUED BY THE LTB!! Your safety and mental health will suffer because you are literally dealing with a dangerous slumlord....and when I mean dangerous, I mean you will feel so alone that even the Ottawa police services would sneer at you when you ask for help and protection. As a woman, I am worried female students or women will be mistreated by this man. I hope this post helps save some vulnerable people HELL from Greg Shannon."
1138,LOISE KIRINDA AND JAMES MBURU,BRAMPTON,"This couple was the worst to rent from. Charged 1700 for their very dark, low ceiling 2 bedroom basement (the 2nd room barely fit my double sized bed) and no walk room)
They constantly allowed their children to play in the hallway that leads to our apartment with their  all at 7am when they have a whole backyard to play in. When I spoke to Loise about the noise nothing changed.
They told me laundry was once a week (I chose Sunday and they said they do theirs on Saturday but yet, they did laundry any day of the week and expected me to pay for the water being consumed. No repairs done prior to me moving in (the shower head literally fell off in my hand and no hot water at random times).
They told me I had to shovel the ""barely there"" snow that my windshield brushed off my car, yet I had to hop the curb every day just to get into my ""parking spot"", ruining my tires and cap. I had a slip and fall because they never cleared the walkway to my apartment or put salt, just their driveway (even though they said it wastheir job to do it). Unfortunately I could go on about more things but needless to say all they cared about was their mortgage being paid but lacked respect for me and my family and didn't care to do any home maintenance or encourage a peaceful living environment. The more I complained about the noise level, the more they made noise (especially in the early mornings when the wife gets ready for work, large items being dropped on the floor as if to say, ""take that!"") Just awful people."
1139,TIM & BRENT PRESSWOOD,GEORGETOWN,"Dog shit all over the backyard. tenants don’t get to use the backyard. told x number of spots are allowed per tenant but can’t even get 1 spot. loud parties on weekends, beer cans everywhere, men pissing in the back yard as well. landlords have threatened us as tenants as well. if you bring a pet in they threaten to kick you out as well."
1140,VINCE MATTIA,MISSISSAUGA,"I came across this site and thought I’d give a shout out to my previous landlord. Vince was always prompt, professional, and really cares about the people that that live in his property. I wish I’d never left but need a larger home. He even went as far to call all his contacts to try and find us a bigger place. Great Landlord!!"
1141,KEVIN JOHNSTON,PETERBOROUGH,Kevin johnston i8s hostile and intolerant only rents to women
1142,BRENT & TIM PRESSWOOD,GEORGETOWN,"these two guys are landlords to get rich! they don’t do any repairs, the brother Tim is an alcoholic. no respect they ignore your requests for repairs. They don’t even service the furnace in the house let alone the salt water machine. disgusting that they own 4 houses and each tenant says the same thing. they don’t do anything. all they do is keep the grass green to show they are good landlords but they are not. Brent is a real estate agent and wouldn’t it be nice for his current and future clients to read this on how he treats his tenants."
1143,HADIL YONIS,MISSISSAUGA,"The landlord is the worst person you could meet in your whole life. He doesn't abid with any Law, refused to follow Residential Tenancies Act, refuses to abide with Police orders and disrespect the tenants. He lies in everything he says and he doesn't respect his words. He is hostile, and can assult the tenants with no care of any consequencies. He would harass, intimidate, and make threats against his tenants. He would make false allegations to the Police against the tenants. Moreover, he lies to the LTB members with no fear of any penalty."
1144,ORANGELIST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WELLAND,"I’m blown away by the lack of professionalism and care provided by these agents of my landlord. They left mold in my home for three months, despite constant complaints. This rendered 2 out of 3 of my bedrooms useless, causing 2 adults and 2 kids to sleep in the living room. It also damaged property that I had to then replace myself. My washing machine was also broken for over a month, where I spent over 200 on laundromat and cab fees and was only granted a 50 dollar “credit” for the “inconvenience”. They refuse to protect the reasonable enjoyment of my unit, despite the documented reports via local PD and camera footage of the disturbances caused to my family. They refuse to investigate the secondhand smoke coming into my unit (I have young kids) and they blame us for any issues that come up. Their solution is for us to move, and they tell us they’re not responsible for the behaviour of other tenants, when they are. If I could afford to move, I would."
1145,SRIKANTH MYLAVARAPU,TORONTO,"On each question, my experience has been that this landlord and his wife Harietha fail miserably.  I highly recommend you live in any other place than one owned by either of these two individuals, at 77 Maitland Place, or otherwise."
1146,IRFAN GILLANI,CAMBRIDGE,Irfan has been a wonderful landlord for 10 years. Any and all repairs have been swiftly addressed and he has even contributed when I wanted to make a change to the house decor. He is so respectful and kind. I know these qualities aren't normally found in a landlord so it's important to share! I have been so happy here and I will be sad to leave.
1147,MARIE TAVARES,HAMILTON,"108 young. Beautiful building and well maintained but the property manager and her husband are a nightmare. They will yell at you, call you stupid, degrade you in front of other tenants, etc. If you have a dog, they will harass you. If you don't cut the recycling into tiny pieces, they yell and swear at you. The husband smokes out the front door, causing the hallways to smell like cigarettes. No notice for water shut off, my mail disappears. If they stopped harassing their tenants and the community (she pushed a unhoused woman cause they were looking through the recycling bin at the road - very catholic of her), this review could have been 5 stars. Do better for your tenants."
1148,JAY PATRY WHO OWNS KENLAR,AMHERSTVIEW,"WORST SLUMLORD EVER!! Jay Patry and everyone who he employees is scummy. The backlog of maintenance requests is years long. They refuse to communicate properly or legally with their tenants and as a result, he's getting taken to the LTB left right and centre. They bully people into going with auto withdrawal, then Change the amounts randomly and whenever they want. It's a very well known rumor that Patry got his beginnings through being a criminal. If you rent with Patry, he will try to ruin your life and credit just for a few extra measly dollars."
1149,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES SAVILLE APARTMENTS,OTTAWA,"The practices are pushing the limits of the landlord tenant act, or interpreted for their own benefit."
1150,MULAKAVALUPIL BIJU,NIAGARA FALLS,The best landlord I have lived with. Very considerate and supportive. Always fixing things on time. Wish there are more landlords like him.
1151,DARIUS EMADI,OTTAWA,At first he seemed great but shortly after moving in I noticed a lot of neglected repairs. Reached out to him multiple times about mice and he told me to deal with it. Extremely greedy and only cares about profit and doing the bare minimum. He has also falsely evicted other tenants in order to increase the rent.
1152,SOHAM AWHAIM,HAMILTON,She is not honest and a big lair. She raise the rent every year more than the government rate. Also she said she want the house for her son to live in then she put it in the market for rent after she evicted me.
1153,REALSTAR,KITCHENER,"This company sucks , treat tenants like crap , never clean buildings , no respect for tenants!!!"
1154,SIGNET GROUP,WATERLOO,"They do a shitty job of taking care of the place, the supers who are supposed to clean the buildings don’t even do that. Our buildings are filled of dust and broken furniture from contractors. Any complaints that are made just get ignored. 
They put up paper issuing when a week they are doing repairs but don’t ever issue a specific date, they hired a company to paint the building the painters painted the balcony door"
1155,NEUSTADT HILLSIDE MANOR INC,NEUSTADT,Our on site manager lacks people skills and is not open to suggestions or questions.
1156,STEVE AND DEB FELD,NEWMARKET,"They are great with collecting rent but nothing else. Many repairs need to be done, they sent a handyman twice (in 5yrs) and he did nothing. They did fix my toilet and the furnace sensor also a hole in the roof from a raccoon, after a week of rain and not covering it in Nov. They show up unannounced in the storage/laundry room downstairs, backyard, driveway. They have tried to make appointments or ask to come in without 24hrs notice. They have given me frivolous complaints in official forms that they never file as threats. They don't file them because they are bs and things that they have zero control over. They over reach on their rights CONSTANTLY so if you come into contact with these slumlords know your rights. They have no clue what their rights and responsibilities are aside from collecting rent.  Deb came in under the pretenses of an inspection (which they have never done and she didn't inspect anything, she looked around) then handed me an official for saying I couldn't use my exercise machine before 9am...overreach and not her business, and told her so, she had the AUDACITY to say to me ""don't speak to me that way in my house"" I told her if she didn't like to get out then I kicked her out of my home!"
1157,LARRY PICKERING,PARIS,Amazing landlord. Very friendly and accommodating.  Extremely helpful. One of the best landlords ive had
1158,COREY MATHIEU,PEMBROKE,He’s one of the good ones.
1159,BUTTONWOOD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"After I signed the lease I met property management company who is taking care of the apartment on behalf of owner. The treatment of buttonwood property management staff was rude and racist. They agreement was edited, agreed upon and signed by the owner to hand over the keys 28th December instead of 1st Jan but the property management people misbehaved and denied the possession of the apartment. I brought all my luggage and I had to wait for 12 hours to get the approval."
1160,SMITHA GODBOLE,BRAMPTON,"This is in Brampton 
She is a divorced a landlord so she is very frustrated in life which is why she makes your life living hell wouldn’t allow you to lease 
Will always keep an eye on you when you do laundary
Count you money each time you put laundry
Using women card and getting away everytime
She also goes through your food because she says only veg allowed 
But not even signing a contract 
Plus no one knows this because she uses kiiijij
Also every Saturday another used to come in the house I wouldn’t she is almost 55 still has needs so unknown people used to show up for her I don’t know what it was 
She stays low and disturbs other please ban her I beg you"
1161,DANUKA ATHUKORALA,EAST YORK,"The worst experience I have ever had as a tenant. Basement apartment. 

Makes inappropriate comments. Messages you in the middle of the night to yell at you for having lights on threatening to come in and turn them off. Charges you more rent when having someone stay with you. Moldy storage area and shower constantly had mold building up. Fridge barely worked. Since leaving, he has a new tenant every 4 months as he offers month to month leases… - I’ve tracked through kijiji and Facebook marketplace ads. Refuses to turn the heat up when it’s sitting below the legal limit. Parties until 3/4am EVERY. Single. Weekend. I could say so much more and be more specific but then I won’t be anonymous. 

Rent is well below current market value. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Don’t fall for the trap."
1162,JUNE LIU,TORONTO,"June is generally a pleasant person to talk too, but she is very unreliable and will avoid repairing anything as long as possible.  she will also often lie, about having the intention to make repairs or abide by her legal responsibilities.  be prepared to pay out of pocket, or spend time going to the tenant board."
1163,XY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"A young business, run by two individuals from MTL. They do not have a firm understanding of tenant rights in Ontario. Upon their hiring as property managers of my unit, they requested a lease resign with several unenforceable clauses including: no pets and no guests without prior written permission. When the CO2 alarm was displaying end-of-life warnings, it took several emails (4+, one linking to the devices user manual) over the course of a week to have replaced. When my unit had a flood, they failed to inform the plumbing company of the source of the water, which led to a second flooding. The upper unit of this multi-unit (3) building was vacant, and the lower unit tenant caught “potential tenants” in the backyard jiggling the handle to the locked shed, and peeking in the occupied unit’s windows. These people were confronted and shooed off. After this incident, XY called the lower unit tenant and told them that “under no circumstances are [they] supposed to ever speak to potential renters” and only backed down when the lower unit tenant threatened to file a police report. Overall, their inexperience and ignorance of tenant rights led to more headache that value, which resulted in their dismissal as management. Be cautious and stay firm on your legal rights when dealing with them."
1164,PEAK REALITY,KITCHENER,"It's like pulling teeth to get anything fixed.  We actually pay for repairs ourselves such as yearly a/c and heat maintenance.  Dryer  maintenance for fire safety which he landlord doesn't believe in because as stated by her "" we don't do that in our house""...."
1165,SUNITA GITE,OAKVILLE,"There are no words to describe how bad her property management was. Constantly bugs and crackheads (that she hired for repairs) running in and out of the apartment, and instead of things getting fixed, more things would go missing. Rents to a bunch of drug addicts and poor college students."
1166,GWL REALTY ADVISORS RESIDENTI,OTTAWA,Units are worn down and no repairs provided. Windows in such a bed shape that you get a feeling that you heat entire Ottawa in winter (no wonder canal didn’t freeze). For many years mold was not treated with urgency - no ventilation. Only multiple requests that was fixed. Minimum is done to maintain the building. Pest issues. Ignorant  management. Good location but wished building owner was more respectful to living conditions of its tenants.
1167,ANJANI DIAL-HOWIE,TORONTO,"You’re in for a wild ride with this property!

Before I begin listing off the problems with this room, here’s a little info about it.
It is a small and really narrow 2 story house with a basement(you share the house with the landlord btw), located in the heart of Little Jamaica in Toronto.

Now to the fun part. The rent for a single room here is 1000$ CAD a month which I wouldn’t mind if the landlord and the property would actually be of the quality expected for 1K a month. Starting off the list, there is no heating in the room during winter nor cooling during summer, I was freezing my ass in my room and to be outside was warmer than being inside, texting the landlord would not fix this issue; during summer the house would become a big hot sauna and changing temperature on the thermostat would be punished and turned back to normal because it is “too expensive.” Moving on, the internet quality is complete trash, I would even say that the internet doesn’t exist there, so if you’re a student, or a work-from-home worker, or just simply want to use Netflix or play on your console, then you simply can’t, because the internet doesn’t work. Continuing the topic of tech, there are often electricity outages on this property, because the landlord has too many dollar-store appliances connected everywhere that constantly put pressure on the electricity leading to shortages that happen regularly twice or thrice a month. Also the washing machine experience is just painful, because either the landlord or her boyfriend do not know where to put tide pods and instead of putting them in the drum the put it into the liquid detergent dispenser and simply clog up the washing machine causing it to stain your clothes with the leftover tide pod bits in the dispenser. Moving on, the landlord steals! Yep that’s right, they steal, i caught them once stealing my food from the fridge, I have also caught them using my detergent that I forgot to take back into my room, also worth mentioning that the fridge space is limited and you also don’t get any space in the freezer, on top of that the fridge space that “belongs” to you can be used by the landlord even though they told me(before I moved in) that the fridge space won’t be touched by them. Next, we have pest issues, I have witnessed countless amounts of cockroaches and since the landlord, once again, did not care , I had to invest into my own cockroach traps, ohh and also the landlord leaves their fruits and other food out for long periods of time so fruit flies are very common. Finishing up, the room quality… while the room itself is spacious the furniture there needs to be freshened up, the bed is broken in some places, there are also holes in the wall that were left from pictures hanging there. 
So yeah, it was my little complaint about this property and I want to save people their money, time, health, and nerves(I myself moved out on the brink of a breakdown) so I strongly suggest you to avoid this landlord and their house at any cost, because there are many other rooms that are better than this and cost less!!!!


P.S. 
Worth mentioning that during hot weather, the landlord has a really bright idea to open every window and door inside their house and leave it open during all night, so theres a high risk of someone breaking into the house and there’s also a high risk to your own safety!!!!!!!"
1168,CHRIS AND JONI TRIBAL VOICES,PORT PERRY,"We were asked to leave because they had to fix the plumbing and pipes in two of their rental units. We weren’t given enough notice, they then ended up “renting” it out to one of their family members/employees. The other tenants in the second apartment weren’t asked to leave, so they lied to us about that. They never fixed the plumbing issue as their store still has an odor."
1169,BRETT,NORTH BAY,This at at 1120 Clarence street. He's takes time to fix things and barely knows how to do it himself. Gave me no solution to mold in all our window casings and some of the walls except mold spray. Sometimes will ignore texts. Nice guy to talk with though.
1170,LOLA CHENG,TORONTO,"Lola was okay landlord except for the rent increase each year. The unit I rented was not under rent control, she increased the rent by 30% each year and I must leave the place as I was priced out. This hurts a lot especially I have been good tenant and recently had baby. For her, and like may others, it’s just money making and doesn’t quite care about tenant’s livelihood or understand the struggles of lower income families."
1171,SOUTHAM APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,The superintendent tries but has his hands tied because the property manager is rude disrespectful and absolutely useless.  She never does anything in the building she is the perfect slumlord.  Building has so many issues and doesn’t care.  I went to apply to another building only to find out she is the property manager there as well.  She doesn’t return my phone calls ignores all complaints I feel trapped can’t afford to move I must have a million roommates unfortunately they are bugs.  Ceiling in bathroom full of mold kitchen cupboards falling apart.  Horrible
1172,WENDY AND PHILIP BHAGOUTIE,BRAMPTON,"Front door gaps back patio door large gap, sewer backup in basement 3 times, no fire door from upstairs to basement apartment, no lock other than door knob keeping the apartments separate, no dryer vent, mold, basement has no heat so tenant brought in electric heaters which I had to pay the bills for . They’re totally rude disrespectful people that should never be permitted to rent"
1173,BRIARLANE,TORONTO,Fair. But excessively expensive.
1174,SUNLIFE,ONTARIO,"So far so good , prompt response"
1175,MEDALLION CORPORATION,TORONTO,"this company is a scam. i lived at 565 sherbourne. thought out my time here i was neglected by the management office with poor repairs, unsafe fire safety, unlawful price increases, repair worker theft and horrible pest control. do not waits you life moving in with these terrible people and their buildings."
1176,MALLEUM PROPERTY MAINTENAINCE,HAMILTON,"The definition of predatory slumlords; cockroaches aren't dealt with, there's constantly a pile of garbage beside the building they don't bother to clean up, they lie to tenants to try to avoid responsibility for basic maintenance like keeping walkways clear of weeds/snow/ice.  A quick search online reveals they've been cited for trying to evict tenants under false pretense as well as abusing city grants badly enough that Hamilton had to change their guidelines to avoid being exploited.  Also cited as one of the reasons rents are so high in Hamilton as they use unethical strategies to inflate rent like advertising units at a ""discounted"" price which is removed after the first year so the rent spikes up 5%."
1177,MARIA AND JAMES STANDISH,OTTAWA,They are old people who don't know the landlord and tenant act very well.
1178,SONJA BEDIC,BURLINGTON,"Make sure to summarize every verbal  conversation via email. And otherwise record every verbal conversation. Know your rights, and read up on the Ontario Tenant Board website to educate yourself if not"
1179,POTSDAM TOWNHOUSES,TORONTO,"The property is ancient with ancient plumbing, appliances, floors. No upgrades done for the 6 years I’ve lived there. Exterior needs new paint. Inside needs upgrades as everything is squeaking and thudding especially the plumbing"
1180,NALINI SIVASUNTHARAM,WELLAND,"Owned by Her and her husband. 
Does little to no maintenance or repairs.
Turns off heat constantly when cold. Does nothing about noise complaints. Uses rental property for personal storage. (Such as a boat)"
1181,SUNNY,TORONTO,I  could go on and on. So I'll give the top four. The bathroom I thought I was sharing with one tenant I was actually sharing with 6. The landlord paid one tenant to bully and intimidate other tenants when he wanted to raise the rent. The house would actually be classified as a rooming house given the amount of tenants with none of the appropriate amenities. The landlord would regularly lock out any tenant who tried to access their room after 11pm. That's just for starters. I've never felt more dehumanized and I've lived in a literal crack house. All while raking in over 5k a month in rent. 0 privacy. 0 respect. 0 honesty. You are better off living in a van.
1182,OAK STREET CO-OP,TORONTO,they don’t treat bug infestation
1183,PAM GARDENS/ KARE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,They bandaid fix everything. It’s shoddy workmanship. Think red-green! The “maintenance” employees brag about taking weekend courses at Rona to fix furnaces. The employees continuously talk bad about the tenants to other tenants. One of the office employees Debby L. has ZERO people skills and talks down to and insults the tenants and makes them feel less then. It’s so bad that one of the maintenance men actually went around having intimate relations with many tenants causing a lot of problems. They continuously enter units unannounced and without legal 24 hour notice.
1184,RICHARD DESCHALEST,ST CATHARINES,"Constantly removing amenities, neglecting repairs and pests and limiting parking for the location."
1185,PRAPAI GRAVELLE,BARRIE,I had a very good experience with this landlord. The rent was expensive (it's Barrie ... ) but Prapai was literally always available and always reasonable
1186,RICKY MA (NXT),TORONTO,"Great guy, won’t bother you for anything. He is very respectable and easy going."
1187,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,KINGSTON,Homestead has been prompt with important repairs and their staff has been respectful. We have had issues with roaches three times and each time they paid for pest control until the issue was resolved in our unit. The building is poorly insulated so the windows often ice up in the winter and it's impossible to cool in summer.
1188,TVM COURTYARD INC,PETERBOROUGH,Awful LL. Wont reply back at all if you complain about anything that needs repairs .
1189,HAZELVIEW,TORONTO,Corporate but highly uninterested in repairing unit damage and heating. Had to contact rent safe multiple times
1190,SAIF,SCARBOROUGH,"Not a good one. Had our lease terminated because he was gonna ""sell the house"" just to find out that we're gonna be replaced by another set of tenants. Awful with repairs, had the basement pipes clogged several times during our 1 year lease. And also, he changed the price of our rent multiple times during that year too. Avoid at all cost."
1191,SAICKLEY,OTTAWA,Judgement and eviction based on assumptions of people’s appearances . Very rude and inappropriate.
1192,JOSEPH BRIGHT,LONDON,"Knowing let me live with roaches, bed bugs, and mice for too long"
1193,WATERLOO REGIONAL HOUSING-CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"One would think the region would follow the rules, and be good landlords, right? 
NOPE! We are not humans to these people. No heat for 2 winters! It took me two years to get them to come fix it! To this day, I have yet to get an apology or an acknowledgment of Wong doing. They still claim that I never put in a work order( even though i have literally keept documentation of all the conversations/emails regarding it) talk about gaslighting!! 
It took me six years just to get the mould in my bathroom fixed( which was part of the lease agreement when I moved in)- they did a horrendous job! Gaps between the shower/wall and door frame/wall, and only painted the patchwork they did for the mould! and even then it took 5 week for maintenance to come back and do it properly… unbelievable. 
  I never had a working buzzard when I moved in, they had three maintenance workers and the Tenant & Community Relations Specialist come to see for her self, I was as told “ WRH will never pay to fix it, as they would have to replace the whole building”.  I was left speechless! 
Fast forward to 2020 and Covid, I was sick and awaiting test results. Since I had no working buzzard, and the Key Holder refused any home aid/pharmacists entrance so that I could get medical help, i had to break quarantine, not knowing if I had Covid or not ( mind you alot of elderly people live here). It’s wasn’t till the EMT had a hard time gaining entrance into the building- my family called 911 as I passed out on FaceTime; they FINALLY fix it AFTER I contacted a lawyer!! 
All in all, they see us as sub human. 

Oh they also allow their key holders to illegally enter our units, without our permission or notice.
Apparently, they are also OK with other tenants (men) buzzing the single women who live here and harassing them. There was an incident where the man actually try to get into a woman’s unit! One night I had 6 Miss door calls between the hours of 11pm-4am. 
We report it all. 
They don’t care about our safety at all.

I feel personally victimized by Waterloo regional housing-cambridge."
1194,MILADA PONJERAC,NORTH YORK,Denied any responsibility in flooding situation and told tenant and family and building staff not to contact her. Strongly suggested tenant needed to pay for maintenance although landlord shared she had not done any maintenance in the past 5 years.
1195,JIANG YONG,TORONTO,Very nice landlord.
1196,JIE HU,TORONTO,Lookout for hidden costs when you close the deal. Forced to pay for repairs that he was already doing after asking us to leave as he wanted to sell the unit.
1197,EQUITY BUILDERS,ST. CATHARINES,This company is so bad even the owners of individual unit started to pull out of the pool yrs ago.
1198,GREG KEEPING,SUDBURY,"Greg keeping was awful. He really is a slumlord. When I was a tenant he never did any repairs, all the windows had issues either broken or no screen. He didnt fix anything. I had mold in my living room and bedroom on the wall probably water leakage anyway he never fixed it! During covid I was struggling to pay rent, he banged on my door one day called me a cunt a whore all nasty words, he even entered the unit one day!! I showed up to windows closed and lights on. He seems like a sweet old guy with a house as a retirement plan but really hes a slumlord who does fuck all"
1199,MEI LING WANG,TORONTO,This landlord terrorized my household. She would appear at all hours of the day and we had to remind her to give us 24 hour notice. We sacrificed the backyard so she would have something to do without harassing us. I have hours of footage of this woman tormenting my partner. New tenants would leave within 2 months of moving in unless they were desperate.
1200,WELLESLEY PARLIAMENT SQUARE,TORONTO,Terrible landlord. Took forever to fix problems. Roaches galore. Turned our free visitor parking into paid parking halfway through tenancy. Take an illegal key deposit.
1201,MAXWELL OBIRI,NIAGARA FALLS,Easily the worst landlord I ever had. Never fulfilled responsibilities. Broken appliances took months to fix. Constantly entered property without permission. Made us take the trash out for their airbnb adjacent to the property constantly. Did not resolve disputes with basement tenants who infringed on our rights. I could go on and on about how terrible these people really are.
1202,WARREN WHITEHEAD,TORONTO,"Warren is a great landlord! Anything that breaks is fixed asap, and he follows all laws and regulations. We sincerely appreciate him, and we love our apartment!"
1203,AMAZ PROPOERTY MANAGEMENT,SCARBOROUGH,Super bad place
1204,"WILLIAM (BILL) MANDELBAUM, BUCKINGHAM PROPERTIES",TORONTO,"Terrible landlord, his apartments are left in  disgusting condition and he doesn't do anything to fix it. He just buys properties and rents them out until he can sell them. When he sold our first apartment with him, he offered for us move into another one of his apartments. We foolishly agreed, but it was also terrible. We moved out, and shortly after that house was also sold. Avoid this landlord at all costs. It's not worth the trouble."
1205,SAMANTHA WITHANA,PICKERING,"Samantha (or Sam as he goes by) rents a house in bay ridges. In the 6 months we lived there he was caught; using his key to come into the house when he thought nobody was home (our cars were gone but someone was cat sitting) we caught him peeking through the windows when he thought nobody was home. He was caught by the LTB for CHANGING the date of my rent cheque and cashing it 2 weeks early and then issuing an eviction notice when it (obviously) bounced. I have this all documented from tribunal. The house had mice, most of our furniture was destroyed. They chewed up the bottom of my sofa and dedicated all inside it. And then when the purposely bounced cheque didn't work he went and forged our signatures on a N12 (agreement to vacate) which we had proof neither of us was in town on the date of the fake signatures. Again, I have all of this transcribed from the tribunal. Oh, all because he doesn't understand that it's illegal to not allow pets in a lease and he couldn't evict us for having a cat that never caused any damage ever."
1206,FRANCOIS (FRANK) THIBEAULT,EMBRUN,"Repairs needed to stop moisture from getting into the unit were ignored for several years. While moving out we noticed that there were large amounts of mold over all of our furniture and anything we had tucked away in closets. Required us to dispose and replace all of these things and Frank refused to take any responsibility for this issue or cover any of our replacement costs. Also, the upstairs tenants moved out the same day we did and they didn’t require 2 months notice or payment for 1 out of 2 months from them but made us give him the 2 month notice and rent for 1out of 2 months regardless of the damages to our things that resulted because of his neglect."
1207,NJS CAPITAL,TORONTO,"I am a tenant as of 2018 and can confirm the landlords, NJS Capital, are demons. I've lived here since 2010 and NJS only took control of the building in 2018. Needless to say, it has turned my peaceful home completely upside down.

We have an active T2 claim against them with the LTB after they put us through 6 months straight of daily renovation construction noise during the first lockdown of the pandemic when we couldn't leave the house. That's when they were busy doing shoddy renovations of the units they had evicted using confusing zoning rules they use and abuse at their leisure. Now we have had no choice but to file a second one because they rented out the basement unit directly below our unit for $5000/month to a bunch of idiots running a music recording studio that uses their unit like a party space day and night. 

There is very little soundproofing to speak of int building. This is a former textile factory converted into live-work units and has never been properly soundproofed for occupancy. The only thing separating units is a thin layer of hard wood. I can hear people cough, burp, fart, cry, fuck, even sing in their shower. If I spilled a glass of water, the entire content will flow through the ceiling into the music studio below us. Before NJS owned this building, the previous landlord was an elderly man who charged below market rate BC of the substandard soundproofing and warned every new tenant about the lack of soundproofing in their lease agreements. We also had a superintendent who lived on site to help mediate noise complaints and for the first 8 years I lived here it was an amazing place to live and I absolutely loved my unit in spite of the lack of soundproofing.

Obviously NJS is not telling any of the new tenants about the lack of soundproofing. New tenant pay nearly 3X what the old tenants pay (who all have rent control). As a result, NJS has resorted to seedy, unethical methods such as weaponized noise pollutoon to get older tenants with rent control to move out so they can start a new lease and charge higher rent. When they first took over the building, they removed the common area laundry & dryer for months, saying they ""needed repairs"", only for the machines to come back later 2x more expensive than before. They are lying scumbags and are actively turning affordable rental buildings in low income neighbourhoods throughout the city in Parkdale, Regent Park, East York, and Scarborough into overpriced slums. They are also developing condos — they bought the former Guardian pharmacy at Queen and Lansdowne. New tenants in our building's newly renovated units report long lists of repairs needed, cosmetic and structural problems, and property management that never reply to emails. 

Watch out for these guys. They're deeply deeply evil."
1208,SORBARA RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES,NORTH YORK,This company doesnt know how to take care of their tenants. All they care about is the money and bother you until its paid but when we need services done or have a complaint about the other tenants they dont care.
1209,SIVAGINI BALARAJAN,PICKERING,Siva and her husband Bala ended up being ordered to pay us thousands for a bad faith eviction. The housing market boomed and they were advised that they could get hundreds more than we were paying (1700+ for a 5 bedroom) so they pretended their newlywed daughter was pregnant with her first and they were going to give her the house. Well we moved to a house in the same school zone (for $2600 for a 4 bedroom) and found out there was a family living in the house because one of the new family's kids was in my kid's class. Their daughter didn't have school aged kids yet. She never intended on moving in. They just wanted more rent so they thought it was an easy way to get us out without argument. These landlords are slimy liars and I wouldn't suggest anyone move into one of their units.
1210,TCHC,TORONTO,"Experts at ""passing the buck"" to another department. No investigation of criminal activity. Ignore their own published policies.  Zero status reporting on service requests. Rude call center operators. Long waits on hotline.  Unskilled superintendents. Some staff are kind and reasonable but in general this organization is completely corrupt relying on tenants to be unaware of their rights. A nightmare."
1211,SUMMIT HOLDINGS,ETOBICOKE,"Property Manager and Superintendents are rude and disrespectful to the tenants.  The building is roach and spider infested.  Management has failed to upkeep the property with regular cleaning, maintenance and repairs.  They have put in an application to increase rents above the guidelines and they can't even keep the building clean and maintained.  For example, major water damage that is seeping through the concrete foundation near garage main entrance to building has been ignored.  It has caused a Niagara Falls situation and tenants have to be hopping, skipping and jumping  over the pond that has formed on the ground.  This issue has totally been ignored.  Garbage is always scattered on property especially near the door entrances.  Carpet vacuuming has ceased since December 2022 because they do not want to invest into a new vacuum to clean carpets. Then they wonder why we have a roach and spider infestation throughout the building.  In the winter, the outdated windows cannot retain the heat within, which causes temperatures to fall below 21 degrees Celsius."
1212,DEVONSHIRE PROPERTIES,MISSISSAUGA,"Overall I believe the landlord overseeing the apartments at 1201 Walden Circle does a very good job. The only concerns I would have are that repairs that are performed for the units tend to be quick fixes rather than solutions, so upkeep of the unit over the years can be questionable. For example, we had a counter with no framing or support underneath due to previous damage and it sunk down enough to prevent the cabinets from opening. When they arrived to make the repair they were ready to simply cut or remove the cabinet doors rather than support the counter itself. Thankfully I informed them of what I thought was needed to fix the problem and they actually listened and were able to add some framing. We also put in a few orders for pest control due to ants and it was dealt with quickly, however, we did have to get multiple treatments done on separate occasions for a suite higher than the 15th floor. My other concern stems from the fire alarms and elevators. The fire alarms go off frequently so I know they work, but I believe they need to be changed because they emit a high pitched noise that I know my partner and those with decreased hearing abilities do not notice or wake up to in the middle of the night. Additionally, one of the two elevators is frequently shut down for maintenance/repair, and yet it still lurches from time to time which is absolutely terrifying. Otherwise there is always someone in the office during open hours that is ready to help and the staff are very friendly. Tenants receive any notices for interruptions and advanced notice is given for any lease changes."
1213,SIFTON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,GUELPH,Easy property management company to deal with. Repairs are done in a timely fashion.
1214,YWCA,TORONTO,Completely ignores repair requests. Talks about private details of tenants to other tenants. Not professional.
1215,SUDBURY APARTMENT RENTALS,HANMER,"Yard is trashy with old cars parked for years. Does not return $ for last months rent interest. Yard is trashy with dog poop on balcony’s and garbage. Security doors do not work, plug ins busted, intercoms don’t work and washer driers are terrible."
1216,ALEX PERLMAN,TORONTO,"Absolute nightmare of a landlord. Avoid Alex Perlman at all costs. I cannot get into too much detail without breaking anonymity, however he goes against all RTA rules and is generally a crook that uses intimidation to squeeze money out of tenants."
1217,SKYVIEW LIVING,OSHAWA,"Repairs take forever, the building is falling apart on the main floor, they fix a pipe 2 more break, all in all the building owned by Skyview living at 822 glen in oshawa is just utterly abysmal, do not rent here unless you want to pay 1200 for a 1 bedroom that isn't even worth 700"
1218,NAOMI TRESTRAIL,TORONTO,"Naomi is the worst landlord Ive ever had. Shes a patholigical liar, munipulative, and disrespectful. If you see a post to rent from her just know not to take anything she tells you as the truth, regardless if its a verbal agreement or even written down, she will likely break it and not care. She will say one thing and deny it the next. She will say you owe her things when you do not. She will try to munipulate you to give her more money. She will steal from you and invade your privacy. Shes a selfish person, who tries to prey on people who rely on her for a home and if you dont do want she wants she becomes vindictive. She definietly has some sort of  mental health issues going on, possibly narcissism. Shes just the type of person you never want to have to deal with, my time with her still has an affect on me to this day, thats how horrible it was. Dont be fooled by her pleasant demenor when you meet. Its all a facade."
1219,ZADEK RAMOWSKI - 8775087 CANADA INC,PERTH,"Zadek is a dictator, who believes that his tenants are beneath him. Any time a tenant makes a purchase, he believes that he is entitled to more rental income, because “clearly he can afford it”
He ignores repeated requests for repairs, and does not address them until either forced by the board, or the tenant leaves. 
The repairs he does on his own, are done cheap and quickly, and always need to be fixed quickly afterwards. 
He will verbally make an agreement with a tenant, and then use try to use it as a reason to evict a tenant later on. 
He goes out of his way to invade your privacy, and talk down to you. 
He has had several cases involving tribunal, and lost. 
He is an awful human being, and if you needed a license to be a landlord, he would loose his."
1220,ROB CRIGER,OTTAWA,"Rob is the best landlord to the point that this review will seem fake, but it’s not. He always gives notice when he has to come inside the home, but sometimes he just pops up outside to shovel the steps. Sometimes he brings cookies when he comes by with the new air filters. 

This man took me to the hospital when I broke my foot.. and then he waited with me for two hours until I saw a doctor. 

He changes our tires. He installed central air last summer. We pay him rent and give him coffee or lemonade when he’s fixing someone and it’s so wholesome I’m sorry others don’t have this. 

This landlord is hard to believe. I wish he owned a lot of properties. Yes I can hear how I sound writing this."

1224,M. SCHIKETANZ REAL ESTATE INC.,KITCHENER WATERLOO,This has been one of the best rental companies I have rented from they always get your repairs done in a timely manner a couple days after a request is made if not the same day. The only complaint I would have is that the flood lights were not operational when we lost power and I felt very unsafe not being able to see down the stairs or hallways incase of an emergency.  That is really the only thing the rent is a great price and the other tenants are wonderful. Do recomend!!

1227,RES MANAGEMENT,TRENTON,"Living under Res Management was a nightmare. At the start of renting we were told that the place was recently renovated, and while there had been bugs, an exterminator had been hired and they were taken care of. 3 months after moving in we found the bugs, cockraches that actually found us as they crawled across our couch. Every other week was either a notice that apartments were being sprayed for roaches, new rules were being added to the building, or they needed entry for some other random asinine reason. If you needed something fixed the landlord would show up and tell you it’s your fault so if you want it to work you need ti pay out of pocket, or they would just never fix it. We went months without a crucial repair because “they couldn’t find what they needed” when yes they could, I found it on Kijiji easily and with first hand suppliers as well. He spoke to all in the unit with disrespect and as if they were children or less. If they show up as property manager at a building you are considering moving into, don’t walk run as fast as possible."

1235,KAMRAN TAJADOD,RICHMOND HILL,"Disappointing Experience with Kamran Tajadod, Iranian Realtor in Richmond Hill, Ontario

I had the misfortune of renting a property managed by Kamran Tajadod, an Iranian realtor based in Richmond Hill, Ontario. While I was initially excited about finding a place to call home, my experience with Kamran quickly soured due to his blatant disregard for the law and a lack of professionalism.

Firstly, Kamran attempted to force our family to vacate the property without any legal grounds. He seemed to be well aware of the laws that protect tenants, but chose to ignore them in favor of his own interests. His primary reason for trying to get me to leave was to illegally increase the rent for the next tenant, which goes against Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.

To add insult to injury, Kamran threatened that if I didn't move out, a family member of his would move in – a clear intimidation tactic meant to make us feel insecure in my own home. This level of unprofessionalism was shocking and left us feeling uneasy throughout my tenancy.

Furthermore, Kamran showed a blatant disregard for the maintenance of the property. When a part of the ceiling became damaged, he refused to repair it, claiming that it was too expensive. This negligence not only caused discomfort but also posed a potential safety hazard for me and other tenants.

In addition to the lack of repairs, Kamran never took any responsibility for the upkeep of the outdoor areas, including lawn care and snow removal. This negligence led to an unkempt appearance and posed additional safety concerns during the winter months.

Overall, my experience with Kamran Tajadod as a landlord was incredibly disappointing. His disregard for the law, unprofessional behavior, and refusal to maintain the property made for a stressful and unpleasant living situation. I would strongly advise prospective tenants to avoid renting from Kamran in the future."

Lots of interesting characters, neighbours will scream at 1am or shove each other in the hallway at 8am. When your lease is up they will charge you an extra months rent and then make it very hard for you to get it back… they’ll just through hoops… don’t do an automatic payment straight from your debit account, because that’s how they took my money and I had to pay the bank to put a block on them. They also will try to get extra money from you, by saying that you owe them interest on the last months rent deposit on the 1.2% rent raise every year, but I called the landlord and tenant board and that’s illegal. They also will give you a monthly “discount” if you pay your rent on time, but that’s also illegal, and even if you pay your rent late, they legally cannot charge you a “late fee”. If they do, go to the LLTB, because it’s illegal. Overall I would probably steer clear because they do way too much shady stuff."

Homeless people sleeping in front lobby and hallways verbally and physically attacking tenants.

1245,2224832 ONTARIO INC. - SPERO & DIMITRI PAPOULIAS,OTTAWA,"Landlords tend to be slow at repairs, also disrespectful to tenants parking that they pay for (tend to think they own the building so they can park in tenant spots whenever they are here. Not just one spot, tend to take muliple), Also tend to leave the renovation garbage/wood, etc.. in the back parking lot, have cut trees down and there are branches and stumps, even old cement and bricks at back of lot by next door garage and such forth. As for inside, when doing renos on an appt, they can take months if not years to fix up, and thus forth people living here have to deal with their noise and disruptions during the time. Will say that they are good with not increasing rent every year, and when they do, they follow the rules of the law. But they do try to skirt the laws to a degree when they can, and have been taken to the LTB multiple times. Not good at communition either, super died last fall and they promoted a tenant to take over, but never actually told any of the tenants personally.  We know from the super but nothing written or anything as such. Front of building cement/stairs also needing repair and have cracks/missing tiles....... inside walls all marked up with bike tire markings and needing paint job for many years now. Looks like it hasn't been painted in 20 plus years, and when they do paint, it isn't quality and often shoes under surface. There are tenants that are noisy and no one really addresses it either.

-> stairways covered with pet urine and shit, people smoking in common areas, rats, bedbugs, roaches, garbage chute area filled with heaps of garbage bags left ouside and stinks the whole floor, tenants plays loud music which you can hear on the entire floor and the management does not care. No safety anyone can enter the building. Parking is filled with unauthorized parking, people drinking and smoking in underground garage. They have cameras on every floor but when you complain and ask them to check they say they are not working.  If you complain they will ask you to leave rather than fixing it. If you have any doubt just check the areas mention and you will see yourself."

My bf and I live with landlord on second floor of a house, and there are two more in the basement - before we sign the contract, landlord lied to us saying basement is empty. No more than a month we moved in, police came once because we were reported as rooming house. But that is just the beginning of the nightmare. Landlord refuse to turn up AC in the winter, so room temperature is always below 70. She warned us several times for eating upstairs instead of in the kitchen - but she is always cooking there so we really need privacy! The worst part is that, we signed a fixed term contract for a year which allows us to renew it after one year. However, she refused to continue the lease, by complaining that her stuff was stolen by tenants. Her son begged us not to go to police, so we just moved out quickly with some really bad memories. If you are looking for a house in this area, take extra care!!"
1249,JUDY BOODRAM 41-10 RODDA BOULEVARD,SCARBOROUGH,"NOTE: This review is for house 41 at 10 Rodda blvd. My experience IMO is a great example as to why we need landlords to be licenced and rentals regulated. At first there weren't a lot of red flags, however the female landlord tried to trick me into giving her my SIN# ""in case of an emergency"". Do not ever give anyone your SIN. Next, take the name I've given with a grain of salt, because I'm pretty sure it's a fake name. They never gave receipts, rent was paid in cash. The landlord was not declaring the extra income they were taking, which is illegal, as was renting this house. With a full house, the landlord was making $2500.00 a month. The landlord was renting a basement apartment and two rooms upstairs, and I was in one room for almost a year. This house is not meant for sublets. In case of fire, there was only one exit out of the house that was accessible. The kitchen was on the main floor, and only one bathroom upstairs. The rooms had a bed with three drawers, a dresser, a mini fridge for food, a chair and a t.v connected to cable everyone was allowed to access. The landlord had cameras all over the house, used to spy on us. She accused one tenant of cooking for someone else and threaten to charge extra for gas or throw the tenant out. She accused another of bringing too many groceries home. She regualrly broke into the rooms and searched them, and when she saw something she didn't like, she would send paragraph long text messages, or stick post-it notes in the kitchen and washroom. If she felt you had too much stuff, she would threaten to throw you out if you didn't store it somewhere else. From my understanding, no one had a lot stuff, as these were small rooms. The post it would say things like, take a 15 minute shower only. Don't let things accidentally drop in the toilet. Only cook food that you yourself would/can consume. Very petty notes. She was renting to adults, but acted like a headmistress in a boarding school. Tenents were not allowed to have guests sleep over, or visitors without getting her permission. She claimed years back it was because she had a young son. Not sure what the excuse is now. Pets were not allowed, and later on plants beause she claimed it would create some sort of bug that stung really hard, just weird. The scariest part of the house was it was maintained by friends of the landlord. Wardrobes were taken away and replaced with four planks of wood and a pole to hang your clothing. This was drilled right into the floors. All the eletricity was done by another friend. In one room, two of the outlets burnt out, one was located right behind the bed the tenant would sleep in. 
The Landlord also rented to very scary people. One tenant was seen on camera dragging out the body of their friend that had OD'd in the basement apartment. Turns out the friend was ok, and the tenant was kicked out. Another tenant hadn't moved in, but was having their welfare cheques sent to the house. They were fresh out of jail with new tear drop tattoos on their face. It feels like this landlord was renting to vulnerable people, people who she could manipulate or kick out easily with minium damage to her. I noticed people who were legit and stronger she'd coniviced or hassled to force them to leave as soon as possible. Basically my experience was bizzare, annoying, and at some points dangerous, and it wasn't cheap, and she should have issued receipts. IMO the city needs to pay this house a visit and note all the red flags and shut her rentals down. The Federal govenment needs to get involved and charge her all the taxes she owes. 
I do not recommend this rental to anyone. It's absolutly illegal. You will not be able to prove you live there or get your money back if something goes wrong. This person is scamming people, and is taking advantage of the rental situation and it's wrong. I'm posting this review to warn people, but also to hopefully get some justice for all the tenants, myself included that were ripped off and harrassed by this woman. Ideally, I hope one day she is never able to rent to anyone again. If it was up to me that would be the reality now."

1251,FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC.,TORONTO,"My review is on the Forest Hill East York location

George is an ok guy. He can sometimes be good & easy to talk to but other times especially when it has to do with other tenant issues & management he can be shady. He has the right intentions but maybe doesn’t want to deal so much with tenant problems. 

For example, if you’re having a dispute with another tenant he doesn’t do much at all unless you keep nagging him about it and have other neighbours who are having the same issues to back you up. And don’t even get me started with Ally. 

She can be a pain in the ass to talk to. She is quick to dismiss your issues and immediately tells you to talk to George or “send an email” rather than actually listening to you and making you feel welcomed living there. I know she is just the front desk person but don’t just make people feel like their problems don’t matter. 

Other issues besides management. Not sure if it’s just this property or a lot of Forest Hills residences but there is a huge problem with roaches. Landlord approves anyone at this point. Also their laundry rooms are horrid! So dirty and dark. Half the time the machines don’t work and take your money. Oh and did I forget you can hear everything everyone is doing in their units throughout all hours of the day? Really just a horrible place to live. Would not recommend."
1252,SKYLINE LIVING,NORTH BAY,"Skyline took over ownership while I was renting in one of their buildings. As soon as they took over there were nothing but problems. Nothing was ever repaired, they consistently sent out notices to enter the apartment but did not give 24 hours, only one or two. Laundry always broken, security doors never shut, garbage everywhere. Their property manager ended up stealing my rent so they took me to court with their fancy Toronto lawyers for non payment of rent. I had all my receipts and they were so unorganized (not even sure what month they were accusing me of non payment) so the case got thrown out. Gave my notice and left after that stress. They arrested and charged the property manager a week later with no apology. Last year their tenants had no hot water for months and there's bedbugs now. Stay away!"

1257,DOMINGOS RITES,TORONTO,"Used non-professional workers to employ substandard fixes to all manner of problems, but especially plumbing. Towards the end of my tenancy, we had sewage backup issues that he refused to call pro plumbers to look at. Once I stayed up all night to continue to bail out the sewage that was backing up into my back tub so it didn’t flood my apartment. I was constantly straining to hear any sounds of water or dripping so no backup went unnoticed. I set up a camera so I could monitor the area when I wasn’t home. It was the most stressful time in my life.

In the end, he used the disrepair of the house due to longterm neglect to evict all three tenants for repairs and renovations, saying “you know, this place hasn’t really been maintained for 40 years.” As if it wasn’t his responsibility.

I was threatened with eviction a year before the final eviction, but when I got a paralegal they withdrew the first filing. In the end, his lawyer daughter negotiated with us, 6 people who had lived a cumulative 27 years in the building, less than $5000 each to move at the height of the pandemic.

They then spent what is probably $500K to gut and reno all four units and re-rented them for triple what we were paying.

While I’m sure the new units won’t suffer the same maintenance problems ours did, this landlord is not to be trusted with something as critical as your home and well-being."

1262,PIETRO AND GUISEPPE DATTILO @ 40 GALLOWAY DRIVE,WOODBRIDGE,"Always paid my rent on time and was there for about 5 years. I rented the Basement, throughout the years, it seemed like for 2 of the 5ish years they'd be doing renovations upstairs which started early in the morning and messed with my sleep, it was really loud and often shook the whole place. 
There were no bedbugs or roaches, the place was pretty nice (there was centipedes and Silverfish bugs but I didn't mind them too much). They respected my privacy but did have a cleaning person come in once randomly and wake me up thinking they were going to clean the basement too (no one told them there's a Tenant?) 

Wiring for some things were questionable, the fan above the stove worked intermittently and we had a light fixture or something randomly start a fire in the middle of the night due to faulty wiring, fire dept had to come!
Promised some repairs / fixes I never got, I'd have to bug em for anything to really get done. Oh and the entry way was always leaking water when it rained, had to scoop out dirty water to prevent the place from flooding a bunch of times! 

After about 5-6 years of staying there, also during the Covid Pandemic when it was pretty bad, they said they wanted me out to 'renovate' the basement apt. They said I could come back but I'd have to pay more rent.  They never gave me any proper notification in writing, but did email me and mention they'd give me a months rent back If I left in 2 weeks as they were planning on starting their renovations. I think it was even before that they started renovating, so that wasn't a lie, they were literally tearing through the ceiling and pieces were falling down on me and my friends as we were moving my stuff out, and I never got that months rent back as promised. He claimed the Fridge or Stove was disgusting and had to throw it away... which we actually cleaned so that was NOT the case.  

I wasn't working at the time due to Covid and I didn't realize rent prices had jumped so high so I had nowhere to go."
1263,BIRCHWOOD VILLAGE (SIREG MANAGEMENT),NORTH BAY,"Repairs have always been done almost immediately after calling. Maintenance is always friendly, timely with snow removal and grass cutting. They clean up the area when garbage is left out or put out too early and torn through by birds. They test smoke alarms/change filters twice a year like clockwork. Rent is only increased by the legal max every year. Its not perfect, but by far the best place I've ever rented."

1265,CAMDEN PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Naina was a horror to deal with, it all began with her telling me the day after I moved in that my unit needed so much repair I had to move to another unit. The garbage from Camden never stopped from then onward, every request for repair was met with blame and finger pointing then usually weeks to months of waiting for anything to be done. Naina would harass and bully tenants over her wrongdoings. When the boiler in the building broke in FEBRUARY they left us with no heat for months, providing one space unit per unit to get by. When the space heater blew my electricity, I had to live off one outlet for over a month while they ‘couldn’t get an electrician’ - and then had to fight them for months to get reimbursed for the increased hydro costs. The one single  laundry unit was often broken, no security measures in place to protect tenants whatsoever, I could go on forever. Naina Joshi and family was such a nightmare, I truly don’t think I’ve ever encountered a ruder person in my life ever. Would never touch a property the Joshi family is connected to with a ten foot pole."

1267,INFINITY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - LEE CORBIN,TORONTO,"This review is specific to the rental building at 122 Fifth Street in Etobicoke ON managed by Lee Corbin of Infinity Property Management. This is a small building with approx. 12 units rented by several long-term tenants, and some newer tenants.  
With all the nightmare stories out there of horrible landlords, I feel like we are very lucky to have an owner and property manager who are helpful, respectful and take care of this building and are respectful to the tenants.  
The building was purchased by a new owner about 3 years ago and they hired Infinity to manage the property.  I was worried that we'd lose personal access to a building manager with a ""property management company"" being involved  (our previous property manager was a private individual vs. a company and he was fantastic). But, I needn't have worried. Lee Corbin from Infinity was assigned as the new manager for our building and he is personable, makes his direct contact info available to residents, he'll respond to texts very quickly and responds to issues/inquiries right away. 

Also, the building owners ensure that the building is maintained well, and follow LTB rules with respect to rental rates. I've never seen them or Lee the property manager be unfair. 
I'm sure this site will have plenty of poor reviews, but I thought I'd emphasize that there are great landlords and property managers out there too."
1268,KITCHENER HOMES,KITCHENER,"The WORST landlords I've ever had. Repairs are not done, no upkeep. Constant excuses on any repair needed. Everything is falling apart."
1269,SHIVA THAYALAN,OTTAWA,"If you happen to be a tenant of this person in Ottawa, I regret to inform you that he is not as benevolent as he appears. After moving in, he persistently solicits private information about your social life, cleanliness, and noise levels from other tenants. He frequently visits your residence unannounced and pressures you to clean the premises. He shows no regard for tenants' rights and repeatedly violates your privacy. I urge you to vacate the property as soon as possible.
In addition, he unlawfully prohibits guests from visiting the premises. This practice violates the law in Ontario since neither he nor any of his direct relatives live there. Unfortunately, I cannot afford a lawyer, and I am focusing on obtaining my degree, so I am unable to take any action against his inappropriate behavior."
1270,CAROLYN GOODMAN / CAROLYN KREBS / MARION LINTON,TORONTO,"This review is for Landlady Carolyn Goodman AKA Carolyn Krebs AKA Marion Linton - the notorious SLUMLORD of Toronto!! She's SO bad, she's got THREE (3) names/aliases! This review is for 171 St. Clair Ave. E. in Toronto, Ontario, however she also owns 500 Dawes Road which is an even WORSE property! BOTH have the same Superintendent Dan Anderson, a 60-something, alcoholic, potentially retarded, misogynistic, obese and abusive waste of human excrement. He and his constant companion Courtney, make up Dumb and Dumber in managing this property. For years, interior corridors has had peeling paint, bicycle wheel tracks on the walls and uneven leveled stairs at the back entrance which MANY people have tripped on as they were NOT properly torn down and replaced but ""patched"". Patch, should be the nickname for this property, incidentally ""the jewel"" in this old lady's crown. She owns the place and is in her 80's (evil never dies!!), and has her middle aged son come and pick up the rent checks. If you want to enter from the front, you'll need to climb over the jumble of filth that is the humanity the Superintendent ""socializes"" with, including any sexist jeers that come free with the price of passage that is almost always blocked! The place is so hot (furnace has been broken for years!), everyone routinely walks around in shorts and tank tops in the middle of January (unless you're ""lucky"" enough to live on the same floor as the drunken Super...and endure his staggering and mumbling as he makes his way down the hall in the late evening hours after chugging his body weight in Heineken!!). Complain about anyone in the building and they'll just pay for his silence in beer. Meanwhile, you live in a near constant racket as the building is so old you can hear EVERYTHING and I mean....everything. I should NOT know my neighbour's ""safe word""!! The Super will go ""investigate"" the offending noise and then go and join in the merriment, point and laugh at you, while you pull your hair out seeking a modicum of calm. It's a vile, disgusting boys club. Don't bother trying to call, visit or serve the Slumlady. She doesn't answer calls (it constantly goes to messaging), and her address up in Richmond Hill is to a Plaza with a PO Box. I'm sure she's made it her life's work to avoid being served legal papers! She is SHAMELESS in her attempts to money grub -- yes, I think she DOES plan to take it with her! She routinely tried to implement illegal rent increases INCLUDING (get this!!), trying to get those increases to apply RETROACTIVELY - before she EVER served the papers. The Super just lies and says he served them. No man, you were OVER-SERVED that night! NO notices went out and what do the people that live there do? THEY PAY THE ILLEGAL INCREASES. Why? Because they CANNOT find anything cheaper or more centrally located in the city than The Inglewood. I've spoken to some who don't dare complain for fear all the complaints make the Slumlady sell the property. Her idiot son will be set for life. I think that's the plan. Just run it into the ground! There are also a lot of nice Filipino residents here who don't necessarily know the LTB laws and again, are too intimidated to stand up to Dan the bully, and they can't find anything cheaper/better. I honestly think 171 St. Clair is where hope goes to DIE. Do NOT rent here. The place is full of backwards-thinking people; the pack rat on the 2nd floor, the 3 guys who drink and drug themselves to the point of near death in the 3rd floor unit in the elbow of the building... The only people I can recommend to live here would be young, single bachelors who don't care about sleep, safety or filth or those that simply cannot find anything better. I honestly hope the landlady and Super burn in the eternal hell fire they both so richly deserve."
1271,OLD OAK,LONDON,"We have had many landlords in the last 6 years and Old Oak has been by far the worst. The come into the unit without permission claiming an emergency, they won’t pay for actual repairs, just patching things and leaving a mess in the units (I have gapping holes under my bathroom and kitchen sinks) there is also a bad pigeon problem and they refuse to deal with it. We haven’t been able to use our balcony since they took over. The pigeon feces is piled so high it is officially a biohazard. I would move if i could afford it. Thanks to rent control i’m not paying as much as some of the newer tenants which i have heard are paying as much as $1800 for units smaller than mine."
1272,STONE RIDGE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OSHAWA,"These people are a joke. The person who runs it, Jeff and his wife are slumlords and blatantly ignore tenants and ignore the property. I highly recommend avoiding them."
1273,SIFTON PROPERTIES,LONDON,When a multi millionaire owns the property . He doesn’t care about his tenants.
1274,MICHAEL J PRESTON LAKEVIEW REALITY,ORILLIA,Doesn't fix anything. Is very rude and disrespectful towards tenants including his workmen. Is friends with shady cops so thinks he's untouchable in terms of the law.
1275,SKYLINE,WOODSTOCK,"Awful landlord with no regards or consideration for tenants wellness, nor maintenance of units. Mold issue galore with no resolution!"
1276,SIMCOE CONSTRUCTION,ETOBICOKE,"Terrible people, terrible management."
1277,PAUL ASTA,PETERBOROUGH,"This landlord was the ultimate slum lord even 18 years ago. The doctors thought I had copd at 19 but nope. Just a terrible environment by asta. If I could Post pics of what he made meMove into because I was a student and agreed to move into “the one next door is just like that one. But a nurse lives in it”
  He has his son so lots but by lots I mean nothing."
1278,MB,SUDBURY,"The landlord at 219 Albinson was very nice and helpful, and while I lived there he usually on top of clearing the snow in the winter. Problems included at least 2 different types of critters (BB and CR) and loud/dirty neighbours. Granted, he sent exterminators as soon as notified about the issues."
1279,HAZELVIEW PROPERTY,TORONTO,"JUST AWFUL!!! NO SECURITY...POOR MANAGEMENT, OVERPRICED, LAZY STAFF! SUCKS!!!"
1280,MAPLE RIDGE ON THE PARC,LONDON,"They may have a pest control issue however it is in alot of places. What makes this property different than anywhere I have lived before is they are right now it. They dont sit and wait. 
The maintenance is done right away, landscaping is always up to standards and the building is so clean. 
The woman in the office is extremely friendly and so patient with everyone. She is a very understanding person. 
I dont plan on moving for a long time."
1281,MARIA KALEDINA,PICKERING,"I rented a basement apartment from Maria in 2019 and the apartment was full of mold so badly there were mold mites in the bedroom. The mold affected my whole life I experienced headaches and physical effects as well as mental effects. 
When I moved in, her ‘brother‘ lived on the main floor (another thing, I never actually met Maria, her brother co ordinated everything so who knows if she even existed.) and he had dogs. Ok no problem I love dogs. But then like a week later the dogs left never to be seen again and I’m awake one night hearing crazy noises in the ceiling(floor space) and walls come to find there’s fucking mice and I’m 99% sure the dogs were just there to scare them or cover up the sound. When communicating with Maria she wasn’t rude or demanding or anything and she did let me break my lease with just one months notice after I kind of used the landlord tenant act to my advantage. To be clear, I didn’t find the mold and mold mites for a couple months and that was the breaking point for me I was understanding that getting rid of mice takes time and the house was on a ravine."
1282,WEI DING,KITCHENER,No complaints at all. Always on it and has been fair with rent increases. Very respectful and quick to resolve any issues.
1283,CENTA REAL ESTATE,OTTAWA,Just the worst kind of people working here. Fern is just a complete a hole of a human. No repairs are done ever
1284,METCAP LIVING,ETOBICOKE,It would be better if there is visitor parking and as well as a gym room or party room.
1285,CHIODO,THUNDER BAY,No respect for your rights.
1286,SID MANAGEMENT,TIMMINS,"I have been a tenant of SID Management for 2 years without any concerns.
Have had a few minor repairs to report and the property manager was on top of it right away-I had to wait a couple days for the maintenance to come but it wasn’t emergency. 
I have recommended people to them and they have been super helpful in finding housing for them."
1287,TERRY HOBLEY,THUNDER BAY,No respect for my rights of any kind and will lie about you.
1288,GOLDEN EQUITY PROPERTIES (2500 KEELE STREET),TORONTO,"Is there any lower than 1 because this building deserves a negative rating. Tenants in this building are desperate for help, the city need to see the situation of the tenants that pays the rent and treated so bad by the superintendent and the people that runs the business . WE NEED HELP!!!!"
1289,STEVE ALLEN,BURLINGTON,"Beautiful property but house very old and had significant rodent problem which landlord ignored.  Premises had unsafe electrical and no heat in the winter.  Had to buy portable heaters which constantly tripped the fuses.  Micro aggression constantly from landlord who lived on the premises.   Hazardous driveway and sidewalk, poor exterior lighting and no cleaning in common areas.  No accessibility to mail and illegally handled tenants mail making them wait or miss deliveries.  Nothing up to code.  Firetrap with no firewall between units.  Tenant required to spend their own money for repairs or things remained broken.  Blocked access to vehicle in parking lot due to landlord hosting friends and family and obstructing tenants vehicles or using their parking spaces.   Gave access to other tenant to my apartment without consent.   Other tenant had keys to my apartment without my knowledge"
1290,ADAM KITCHENER,INGERSOLL,"Pro - very uninvolved, didn’t really hear from him or expect him to show up unless showing unit, fire alarm inspections, supervising repairs etc.

Unfortunately he was super flaky and would  just not show up when he said he would or would show up totally outside the time frame we were giving. Just a lot of wasted time and plans that could’ve been avoided if a bit more respect was paid to our time. 

Repairs would often take a while to be completed because of the continuous no shows, but eventually got done. 

Rent was higher than he’d said it would be at first showing, which he explained to be from the inclusion of appliance that didn’t arrive until months after moving in. 

Would’ve been a decent rental experience if he treated his tenants as real people with their own commitments, and lives that depend on working through the day."
1291,ALI CHAMS,LONDON,Our place flooded three times and had mold all over apartment and ali refused to admit any fault for the third flood once the windows weren't put in correctly. Then tried to make us pay for moving all our stuff out of the flooded apartment
1292,AON INC.,PETERBOROUGH,"Been with AON for near 10 years. My landlord has always been on top of any issue I've brought forward. They ensure I am aware and comfortable with having maintenance workers come in. Any maintenance they've hired has been really kind and respectful. The common areas are kept clean by a superintendent who communicates if there are any issues and always responds to concerns. They follow the law regarding rental increases, I am notified 90+ days in advance and they only increase the legal amount. I can also pay my rent through an online portal. 5 Stars"
1293,GILAS MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"After a lot of not great landlords, I am so appreciating this company. I don't have any complaints at all - they do repairs immediately, are great at communicating, treat tenants with lots of respect and even do small actions to support the local community. Highly recommended."
1294,POLONIA PARK,WINDSOR,After repeated work orders submitted things are still not repaired 1 and half years later
1295,TOMKEN PLACE (MORGUARD),MISSISSAUGA,"Typical Morguard building, infected top to bottom with cockroaches, homeless person lives in the stairways, smokes and pisses all over the walls, has the run of the building and roams the hallway all hours of the night playing loud music and singing top his lungs, not unusual to have to step over him in the early morning at the front door, half naked with his private parts shown, smells so bad you know he is around before you see him. It is a revolving door when it comes to keeping maintenance staff, been down to one again since January. Security is so bad that anyone can enter and leave the building any time they want. Water leaks were so bad that tenants were getting sick from the mold, Morguard answer was to contact your insurance company and have them pay for a motel room for 3-4 months and put your furniture in storage, one tenant did that and moved back in, two weeks later it was back to leaking. The list is to long for this review, tenants have been recording their stories and plenty of pictures to backup everything, The Property Manager is rude, refuses to do anything and becomes very confrontational when you complain, it is her way of not having to deal with it, you get warning letters that you will be evicted for not paying rent, even when you show your bank statement that the check was cash by the landlord, you are expected to go to the bank and pay for a copy of the check. How hard is it to assign payment as paid when the unit number is on the check? Used to be a very good building, many tenants have suggested to friends to find another renting option over this building. It is located at 935 Dundas Steet East."
1296,ADVENT,TORONTO,Absolutely awful slumlords. Dishonest property management. Trying to get rid of long-term tenants by treating them poorly and neglecting repairs so they can raise rents. Very greedy.
1297,KINGSTON FRONTENAC HOUSONG CORPORATION,KINGSTON,"They are terrible at maintaining thier buildings and neglect some of the buildings they manage.
They dont distribute the time and effort into all there buildings fairly. The heating is capped at 23 and is freezing during winter and they do not care  and will not raise the heat"
1298,MEDALLION,AJAX,"Security of the buildings is terrible. Easy entrance to the buildings for street people causing issues such as theft, door handles checked and smoking in stairwells setting off numerous fire alarms. Repairs are delayed or just not done. Could be a really nice place to live, but they lose good tenants."
1299,ANDY CHEN,TORONTO,Shoddy renovations and not helpful.
1300,BETY SOARES,TORONTO,"Highly recommend against renting from this landlord. She is unfriendly, unhelpful, and rude."
1301,PAPON,TORONTO,"Very cheap guy 
Using second hand equipments and things left by previous tenants"
1302,FRIENDLY OF 80 OTTAWA ST,ARNPRIOR,The landlord of 80 Ottawa street failed on two occasions in 1.5 years to pay the gas bill resulting in the heat being turned off by the gas company.
1303,HOMESTEAD,BURLINGTON,Spotty rentals here.  Some buildings are nice and others not so much.  I think that the demographics of the tenants plays a factor on how they operate their buildings.  I’m in my second building and it’s sooooo much better then the first.
1304,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,TORONTO,"This company couldn't care less about its tenants. They have remodeled the hallway three times in seven years so that they can apply for above-guideline increases, while my kitchen sink fixture is leaking and rotting, and my bathroom tiles are buckling from trapped moisture in the walls. They hire the laziest contractors,  who are obviously related to main office employees, and jobs that should take four months will take two and a half years. They put elevators on ""service"" and use them as their personal elevators while dozens of people wait for the one of the two elevators they bothered to keep in operation. The Spanish-speaking workers favour the Hispanic tenants and refuse to help anyone white, black, brown, or Asian. I could go on...just do yourself a favour and stay away from Homestead."
1305,BRIARLANE,TORONTO,N/A
1306,LEN BRANT,COURTICE,"Really shady, will smile to your face but will try to kick you out without following rules. Gets his realtor friend to blackmail and lie to you about laws. He is also a peeper!"
1307,BAYSHORE ST JAMES COURT,ORILLIA,"I lived here for 8 years, the first 7 years it was very clean and things got fixed in a timely manner when Brian was the superintendent. A guy named Bruce took over and that part also went way downhill. It's infested with drugs, bed bugs and police presence. Bruce also gossips about all the tenants. Very unprofessional."
1308,ANNA PELUSO - ORCHARD APARTMENTS (SOUTH KINGSWAY) LP,TORONTO,"Horrible, nasty, harassing and retaliatory landlord who breaks the law and harasses tenants who attempt to hold her accountable."
1309,AMIT SANGHAVI,MISSISSAUGA,"Great landlord overall, really cares about his property and takes care of it well. Also, is respectful to his tenants."
1310,ANDREW BRENNAN,MIDLAND,He is a slum lord. The apartment was moldy and things were broken. The girl that showed us the apartment lied about smalls things to cover up bad work. They never had one thing fixed in the years we lived there. There wasn't much choice of places to rent when he was buying up all the houses he could get his hands on and shottily splitting them into apartments to maximize income. Also doesn't seem to like paying last pays to employees. Terrible person and terrible slum lord
1311,MEDALLION CORPORATION,BRAMPTON,"Classic corporate landlord, zero real respect for tenants, will call a middling unit with landlord special appliances a luxury unit to your face.  Lies about their unit types, slow maintenance because of underfunded supers.  Never directly abusive but property managers are usually delusional or comfortable lying about anything that might cost them any money.  For some reason are dead set on never having anything but the cheapest possible maintenance."
1312,SAICKLEY PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"Saickley was very hands-off with our unit, which contributed to privacy - they weren't hovering around like I've had with other landlords, but they didn't come in for anything. We inherited the unit from other tenants who passed along the lease from other tenants, all of whom spent multiple years in the same unit, which made the rent very cheap at the time. They would cross out some names and put the new ones above it, so when we got a new roommate, there were over 12 crossed out names on the lease.
That was decent, but it was very telling that the landlord was just making money off of us with absolutely no work, besides owning the place.
When we did need repairs due to the older unit becoming decrepit from regular wear and tear, they became hostile and much more involved in our lives. The front doors' hinges and keylocks were rusting off and breaking, making our unit incredibly insecure, to which the landlord accused us of ""partying"" that lead to the hinges and locks being broken. When we actually did a walk-around the unit, our personal items were commented on and ridiculed. It wasn't until we made legal threats that they did the bare minimum of repairs.
Finally, when we moved out, they charged us extra and illegal fees. They charged us a cleaning fee despite not providing a walk around of the unit, an additional month of rent on top of the 60 days notice we provided, and removal of appliances which was their responsibility. While these were disputable and illegal claims, they never took any of us to claims courts for these and could be ignored - it was definitely an attempt to get some extra cash off of us before they did the necessary massive repairs or renovations for a new lease of tenants."
1313,MARC GUIZZO,HAMILTON,This guy is as corrupt and sleazy as it gets.  I'm in law enforcement.  He routinely tried to rip my spouse and I off on utility bills.  Never did repairs.  Will talk to you like you're stupid.  He's beneath a used car salesman.  Pure scum.
1314,REALSTAR TARAWOOD PLACE,PETERBOROUGH,"Hallways are not being vacuumed, elevators not being wiped out, laundry room always has broken machines, ne er answer emails and never in the office"
1315,FRANK & LISA CICCIA,BARRIE,"Moving to a new city hours away from family can be scary; but Frank & Lisa made it easy. Our viewing of the apartment was easy going, they were super friendly. When my fiance & I moved in, they left us a welcome basket with treats and coupons for the area! As well as a money tree for Goodluck. Our tub had some issues and Frank was quick to repair! The one bedroom was a bright blue colour & we wanted to paint it, so we all agreed on a colour! We moved in a month before the COVID lockdown, and during so they checked in on us and asked us if we needed anything. They treated us like family. We later got the opportunity to rent a full house rather than a smaller condo, and they were more than willing to work with us to an agreement on ending our lease early. I couldn't be more thankful for two amazing landlords who really care about their tenants. I would easily recommend them"
1316,CHESOO (CHANEL) JUNG AND JUSTIN,ETOBICOKE,"Worst experience renting in Toronto I've ever had. They kept revising the rental agreement well into a month into my time in their basement apartment so I didn't entirely know what I was getting into. They offered no privacy. We started off sharing laundry machines. They would come down into my apartment with only 15 minutes notice every other day ""for laundry"".  They would also come into the apartment with no notice when I was not home to ""do repairs"".  It was completely un-liveable.   They were just constantly in the apartment. There were many problems with the house, including heating. The heating was not properly functioning and I had to go without heat in the fall and winter for quite awhile. They supplied space heaters but not right away. I froze.  They had two giant rottweilers that suffered from separation anxiety. Whenever the owners would leave in the morning the dogs would bark and cry for at least an hour every single day. There was no sound proofing or sound insulation so I had to hear this as a start to every morning in the house. The relationship with them soured and they began to bully me mis-using various landlord notices to intimidate me. They bought a separate washing machine as noted by the maid but were still invading my privacy to wash the dog's things every few days with the machines I used for my clothes. When I told them I wanted to move out quite early they wouldn't return my deposit for last month's rent even though I wasn't going to stay there more than a few days into the month. They also made move out difficult refusing to open the side door to allow me to maneuvre my furniture out the cramped side entrance of the house.  Horrible experience. I lost money. They profited. My entire time there was torture.  They even called the cops on me and my father when my dad put himself between me and the rottweilers when Justin was trying to bully me.  Truth be told I think the wife was jealous or concerned and that's why she was trying to exert so much control over me by invading my privacy all the time. Otherwise I can't imagine why things would start off so negatively and then just get progressively worse to such a level of toxicity.  If you can avoid it please never rent from these people."
1317,KWO HOLDINGS INC.,MILTON,"Fantastic, attentive and understanding landlords. Always quick to have things repaired and friendly."
1318,RENTALS 101,ST. CATHARINES,"Patrick from maintenance is great. My student house is alright. The property manager Christien Coulombe is terrible, very rude, and does things that are boarder line illegal per the tenant act. He harasses tenants."
1319,DISTRICT REALTY,OTTAWA,"I use to rent from District Realty located at ******** in Ottawa. The landlords friend person who lived on main level who lived in the building would harass and threaten many tenants and myself repeatedly. The landlord district Realty would illegally enter my unit on many occasions without notice. The Superintendent is lazy and barely does any work. The apartment building has been left without repairs in many years, has lots of bug issues inside of apartments and building. This building isn't maintained that well.  Also not worth renting from here while you'll be constantly harassed and threatened by landlords friend who lives on main level of building on a constant basis. They try to raise the rent higher than legally allowed. They've been trying to illegally evict tenants who've been living there for several several years because their paying a much lower rent amount and wanting to evict tenants so they can raise the rent to newer tenants at much higher market rent. 
In my opinion do not rent from here nor ever from district Realty."
1320,ERIC SUTTON,GEORGETOWN,He rented an illegal basement apartment and then claimed he needed our unit for personal reasons.When we disputed his claim he tried to sue us in Small claims court.We also could not move as our front entrance was dangerous and not suitable for use.We had floods in our garage that were never addressed. When in the process of moving out he illegally locked us out.
1321,SKRTICH LIVING,THOROLD,"Sometimes minor repair requests take a little longer than I wish. Also, they seem to inspect the smoke detectors every other month, little excessive in my opinion. However, the building is always clean. The amenities are nice and well maintained. The superintendent Jessica is very approachable."
1322,CEPM,SCARBOROUGH,"This property management hires Building Managers that are only in the job for the perks they get, like free rent and parking.  Their professionalism is subpar, maintain a not my job attitude all the time.  Has ZERO respect for others. falsifies documents and when caught says it was a mistake, hands out N5s without just cause,  has a poor attitude with regards to work ethic. for example office hours are 8-5. Goes for coffee runs at 8 comes back around 8:45, gets on social media during work hours and claims they are super busy. lunches are 2 hours long at least and closing time starts at 4 even though 5 is cut off.  God help you if you call and have an emergency after hours, no one picks up the phone. Emergencies aren't treated as emergencies. You aren't allowed to say anything to building staff when they are off the clock beyond hi, and sometimes not even that.  Management hands out threats to tenants before obtaining full facts i.e. stating radio is too loud and you aren't even home! Has you call a management company the MOMENT your visitor parks on building property and marks against one of your 8 visits a month where you can see people. Regardless of the stay it's deemed  an 8 hour visit.  Hired their relatives significant others to work for the company so they too can get free rent and parking.  Looks down at tenants like they are better than everyone. Hands out 24 hours notice of entries and never shows up. One time was 3 notice of entries in a 2 week span and didn't show up to any of them, and just really needs to go, as it's one bad building manager after the other hired. The staff are the face of the company, and if the staff are not good, makes people give pause with regards to the REST of the company."
1323,TCHC,TORONTO,This landlord also doesn’t upkeep the property outside common area's. Eg: snow removal. This landlord harbours tenants who are antisocial and who continually harass other tenants. Major safety risks yet go completely ignored by TCHC management. Shameful!
1324,AMARJIT KAUR,CALEDON,They are very cooperative and friendly family who have always helped us in so many ways. We never felt like tenants from the day we are living here.
1325,KEN,TORONTO,"Was a very nice spot to live.  Besides the Rodents and traffic outside.
The landlord will renovict. 
They own the home hardware downstairs.

The last Conversation I had with the landlord 
After being a tenant for multiple years. I asked if everything was going okay and if they were happy with how things were going. They said everything was great and they had no issues or plans to change our agreement. The next day they left us an eviction notice because they were ""moving in family"". After we moved into our new apartment we got a call from the landlord asking us if we wanted to move back for almost double the price. Because it was renovated... and the new tenants didn't work out."
1326,REGENT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SAULT STE MARIE,"Honestly, living in a rental managed by Regent was a nightmare. It took them over a year to fix the dryer. Never fixed the washer. Let the basement flood constantly because they wouldn't repair it. And when we moved in, in mid-DECEMBER, there was no heat or hot water for a week. They had ""forgotten"" to go to the electric company and set up an account for the rental, as heat/utilities were included."
1327,PETER DIAKOGEORGIOU,TORONTO,Slumlord of the worst order.
1328,NIAGARA REGIONAL HOUSING,ST CATHERINE’S,My wife died just over a year ago my heath is not so good they threatened to evict me if I did not donate or throw out her stuff they also made throw out my kid’s clothes and toys and they been coming in two my unit every two weeks
1329,ARTUR ROITMAN,BARRIE,"He was a great landlord, understanding and respectful. Was never out to get the highest dollar from his renter just wanted a good tenant. Quick to respond and respectful of the space."
1330,BEAUREGARD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"What a terrible human being. Stephanie Beauregard failed to pay even basic utilities leading to literally dozens of times the Gas AND Hydro were cut off, for sometimes days on end. We had a massive sewage water leak from toilets that left the kitchen in an inhospitable state for almost half a year before any type of repair was even initiated. They constantly refuse to accept words they’ve said, even when shown in writing their own emails and texts. They’ve attempted to swindle money out of tenants pockets by revoking parking spaces in the lease and assigning them to other units (and then claiming that you didn’t pay for it so why should you get it, even if it is in your lease as yours and has been for years?). They have zero concern about the upkeep of the home, allow tenants to smoke cigarettes indoors and have pets piss all over the common entrance carpets. This landlord will make your life a living hell, do not under any circumstances live in a building they owned, or rent from them. It is highly ill-advised.

We lived there because it was cheap rent we were grandfathered into, and had no other place we could afford. We’ve since left the property, for obvious reasons."
1331,FIRST SERVICE RESIDENTIAL,TORONTO,"Peter T (Senior Building Manager) and Salvatore A (Property Manger) do a terrible job managing YC condos in downtown Toronto. They can never be reached, and do not have a command over the staff (cleaning crew/ concierge) in the building. The building is in disrepair. Elevators are always breaking in the building. Cleaning staff do not clean the common areas. Vomit and dog shit in the elevators left over the weekend. Pool is always broken and dirty. Shit left in the pool. Concierge staff lose packages and are never staffing the front desk. Homeless wonder around the building assaulting residents. Avoid this building at all costs!"
1332,MEDALLION CORPORATION / COMPASS,BRAMPTON,Swat team is here on a weekly basis. The units are flooded with Ants and Roaches. Horrible! Would not recommend.
1333,PENNY SHURR,SIMCOE,"This landlord refused to turn heat on during winter time , refused to replace water tank when the hot water never worked , refused to replace a toilet that would not flush , and refused to fix a bath tub that had a sewage back up , after 4 weeks of living in the smell of the sewage I had no option but to move out . She also breaks and enters into your apartment without giving notice and also changes the locks without notice , she is very rude and has no respect for her tenants . I would never recommend renting from her ."
1334,STEVES & ROZEMA,SARNIA,Pretty sad when your on a disability and you rent is more then your check
1335,JDN,LONDON,"Had water coming into the basement for 6 months, refused to help and refused to hold the landlord responsible. They ended up getting fired when they passed a former tenants exit inspection. Landlord had to pay $10,000 in repairs out of pocket after JDN passed the inspection.

Even their maintenance supervisor says they are a garbage company and he'd never rent from them, not even for free."
1336,DAN REINER,WINDSOR,"Property was an uninsulated hydro nightmare, had a rodent infestation, and my almost certainly riddled-with-asbestos bedroom ceiling caved in and he never fixed it. It was like that for months and was never repaired before I moved out despite my pleads for its resolution."
1337,WALTER KUNG,TORONTO,"Walter Kung was a terrible landlord. The apartment was given to us in a horrible dirty condition, full of garbage, mice and cockroaches. We cleaned the apartment and tried to get rid of the problem ourselves, but the apartment building was fully infested and Walter would never make any efforts to fix the problems or help us. Living in his apartment building caused me terrible depression and anxiety and I still struggle with the health problem from living in these conditions many years later. He was an absolute nightmare to deal with and asking for anything, including asking for our unit to meet basic fire codes, resulted in us getting yelled at and ultimately he never did anything. Do not live in any of his buildings. He is a slum lord."
1338,TORBILL HOLDINGS LTD,KINGSTON,"My unit was renovated and clean before I moved in.  Great location and rent price is very reasonable compared to most around. 
Can't complain"
1339,MAHYAR GORJI,OTTAWA,"Honestly a pretty great Landlord. Chill dude, not crazy with the rent, and keeps things up to date in the home"
1340,PERRY LEE,TORONTO,Pretty good- came by often to visit his mother next door
1341,TORBILL HOLDINGS LTD,BELLEVILLE,"This building has come along ways since it was named the ZOO years ago!
Apartments are completely renovated when you move in and the building is being updated little by little.  Can't say I get along with every tenant in here but that is anywhere!  For the most part it's a great place to live and I can only for see it getting better"
1342,INNA PRIKAZTCHIKOVA,OTTAWA,"Very bad landlord, avoid to do repairs and try to go as cheap as possible, exposing tenants personal information and discussion"
1343,JAAG PROPERTIES,LONDONT,Jaag group is a scam. Adam is a thief they are super nice to you when they want to get you to sign up with them but once they have your money they are literally useless. They con people into thinking they can help but their end game to make you lose it all. They take your money that’s supposed to be held in trust and buy cottages and new trucks and when you try to get out of your contract with them they admit that the money isn’t there. Beware all their reviews are fake! It’s literally all of his employees friends family leaving reviews. Adam and Alfonso are the biggest cons out there
1344,PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TORONTO INC.,TORONTO,"Haven’t had a single repair completed during my entire tenancy. They won’t look at missing shelves or light fixtures, and refused to check an AC that wasn’t cooling correctly during the winter (they make it incredibly hot, 25-27 degrees hot, throughout the entire building without choice). Be ready to supply income history and pay an absurd key deposit of several hundred for a simple key and fob. They refused to pay for the secondary costs of almost $100 an hour for the elevator required to be used to move in, an item not on the lease document or building terms - citing its a different company responsible, while also not allowing you to use the other elevators in the building at the same time. 

Otherwise OK landlords, do frequent safety checks of the building, keep the property in good condition. Just don’t expect more than that"
1345,BRIARLANE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SCARBOROUGG,Twice they tried to give us illegal fines. They refused to pay deposits back for keys we had to pay to the old management. We were never late on rent and they still treated us and everyone else like we were a giant inconvenience. Absolutely despicable.
1346,ED BEDINOWSKI,ST CATHARINES,Not a good landlord. He reneges on his word and doesn't treat you like a person. You are only a number in his eyes.
1347,MANOJ GOYAL,OAKVILLE,randomly increases rent and and can just enter your room if you don't come out within 2 knocks
1348,TRACY TAYLOR,HAMILTON,Crack head theif landlord 177 bell ave. Will go through your apartment when not home and steal from you.
1349,MARTIN SCIPIEN,MISSISSAUGA,Too bad all landlords on as good as this guy because he is everything a landlord should be. Martin for president!
1350,DMS,NORTH YORK,Shity Superintendent
1351,GK YORK,BRANTFORD,Rented years back. Greedy company. Never repaired a thing until days before we moved out despite many many calls.
1352,TARA NEGUS,TRENTON,"Tara was kind during our viewing of the property & during the signing. There were 3 of us on the lease, me, myself and a family member. Two vehicles. Our landlord owned the upstairs, we shared the entry and laundry. We didn't have a door seperating our apartment (her basement) to the shared entrance. She knew we had a cat and allowed it despite the no door for us. Eventually, she said that our family member had ""over stayed"" despite him being on the lease and paying rent? Also told us to keep our cat downstairs, which is impossible considering we have no door. So I put my beds headboard at the stairway. She gave her boyfriend the code to the front door, and in the middle of the night i was home alone, and i heard the door code being entered and opened. Then boots being taken off. I was in the middle of doing laundry, so i eventually had to go upstairs to switch it over. Only when i went to do so, my clothes had been tossed to the side so he could do his. She had come downstairs early in the morning to get someone to come look at the furnace, but had not told us before hand so we were unaware they were coming. My fiance worked shift work so he had quite literally just gotten to bed. He yelled towards the stairs ""where's the notice"", and she yelled back ""what notice"". Our family member decided to move out due to her constant harassing of him being there. She's a flight attendant for the military and lived in Kingston, so she was only in town during layovers. So it's really odd that she was so worried about the members of the lease living there. There was no stove, only one window. So it isn't even a legal apartment. Glad we got out of our lease early."
1353,CHANGEMAKERS CO-OP HOMES INC,KITCHENER,"This is a combination property containing apartment building and townhouses. I have no experience living in the townhouses, but the management and repair staff are the same between them. The rents are very affordable, and even if the units themselves aren't fancy they're clean and taken care of. There is one dedicated maintenance man, but the building has companies on call for specialty work like plumbing, and a company comes in once a week to professionally clean. Work orders have always been dealt with promptly, with proper notice given and respected for unit entry. The building has a debit machine in the office to pay rent with if you like, and they will also take interac transfers which I appreciate, I think it shows that they want to take our convenience into consideration. At one point a resident's family was expanding and building management offered them first dibs on a larger apartment so they'd have more room for the baby without having to move, which was very sweet to see because they could have just posted it at market but they gave it to them instead! Changes like laundry machine fees are voted on by the residents instead of just making the decision and posting a notice. Barb, the building coordinator, is a delight. A bit no-nonsense, but always ready to help when you need. Really the building isn't fancy but it's maintained well."
1354,PAT AND KAREN. GEARED TO INCOME HOUSING,COBOURG,Where should I start with the constant nagging from Karen about anything our children do even chalk on SIDEWALKS. Constantly telling other tenants information on others. Very rude and don't fix ANYTHING
1355,CHENG MYERS,KINGSTON,"Cheng is actually one of my best landlords. She’s increasing my rent 2% after a year on the dot, which I find frustrating, but it’s within her legal freedom to do so. She’s very quick to respond, fast with repairs and is polite and friendly."
1356,YING MO,TORONTO,"She served her previous tenants with an N12 in Dec 2022, meaning she shouldn't rent again until January 2024 but she's listed the house in at least 3 places already (which is illegal).
Do you like black mold? How about fridges without shelves, or appliances so old they die? Or, for the truly brave, how about living above someone who has a locked door while you have absolutely nothing, not even a baby gate?
She was caught on camera sneaking into the rental living space around midnight on more than one occasion. Under the kitchen sink is full of black mold that she refuses to remove because then she'd have to replace the countertop. The washing machine died because it was over 20 years old and she did not replace for two weeks. Between September and December 2022, she harassed the previous tenants over a drip she claimed to hear even after at least 4 plumbing or other contractors told her there's nothing wrong. She accused her previous tenants of lifting heavy weights on the top floor and somehow damaging the room, even when the tenants had nothing of the sort and weren't even home at the time she accused them of lifting weights. She planted sound recording devices in the common area and the garage (which was supposed to be just for the tenants). The by-law office was called when she cut the power to the central heating and let the temps fall to 16 degrees in November. After she got in trouble for that, she had a technician move the thermostat to the basement (which is her private residence with a locked door). She has no problem shoving her personal life on tenants, including blaming her ill health on your cooking, having you intervene in her fights with religious institutions, rambling paranoia about the Chinese government, and telling tenants the neighbours are mad at them even if it isn't true.
10/10 would not rent again."
1357,JOSH CURLEY,ARNPIOR/RENFREW,"Amazing, super caring, super understanding landlord. Up keeps the properties and is genuine."
1358,BEN SABOURIN,NORTH BAY,Mr. Sabourin has taken over the management of his rental properties. Our unit was fresh as we moved in. Renovations had been completed-it looks fabulous.  He is absolutely receptive to even the smallest of items to repair.  He makes you feel comfortable in all conversations.  With minimal options available we are great full that we were selected to move into our apartment.  We look forward to maintaining a longstanding relationship with him.
1359,FRED SHIELDS,BOWMANVILLE,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS MAN! He was so disrespectful to my boyfriend and I. Here is just a FEW of the things he has done to us:
He barged into our apartment to check a water meter in our bathroom without any consent. He blocked me in the driveway so I couldn’t get to a job interview. He also would yell at my boyfriend and I on multiple occasions. He snipped our camera line. He would bring the ex landlord that sexually harassed me onto the property after knowing this and claims he wasn’t told. He also did nothing about the fire alarm that wasn’t working. He  made creepy sexual comments about a woman I knew. He also did not have common courtesy to let us know that people would be measuring the broken door in our house. When we took this guy to court for harassment, he told the judge he would slap me across the head. He made very inappropriate remarks as well. Please DO NOT rent from this guy. Stay far away!!!"
1360,AG SECURE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TOTTENHAM,"The property was a disaster when viewed. Not rentable at all.  We agreed to reduced rent and that I would make necessary repairs to the property. I would supply the labour and they would reimburse me for the materials.  
I spent a month repainting, refinishing the hardwood floors, replaced all the trim and had an electrician fix and replace the faulty (arcing in some cases) electrical outlets and switches.  

They never came to inspect the interior of the property for several years, including failing to inspect the fire alarms or co detectors.  

Eventually one of them came to check the detectors and was blown away at the quality of the home.  Said that the difference was remarkable!

That’s when the bogus and harassing LTB claims started coming in.  They also screamed at me in my front yard on a unannounced visit and accused me of “stealing electricity” because I plugged in a diesel truck for an hour on an extremely cold day. (No where in the rental agreement did it mention anything about how I could use electricity with the exception of window mounted AC units) 

I fought and won several times at the LTB because I had done nothing wrong.  Eventually, one Tribunal ruled against me not based on the facts of the case but the fact that I had been in front of the LTB so many times in quick succession…

Once they evicted me, they more than doubled the rent.  

Real human trash to evict a single parent with a 5 year old just for an additional 5% increase to their revenue stream on the property."
1361,ANICA POPA,OTTAWA,Went crazy after her husband left her. She kept trying to get me out of the unti/sign agreements. Saying she would be living their. I just left on my own terms and then a month or two later saw the place for rent. So if I signed that form it would have been a bad faith eviction. She keeps her address as her rental because of she lives in QC but needs and ontario address??? Fraud I'm assuming. STAY AWAY SHE AND HER PROPERTY AINT WORTH THE HEADACHE!
1362,SKYVIEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OSHAWA,"They are trying very hard to be the worst slumlord in Oshawa. 

They refuse to properly repair anything, they refuse to salt the parking lot, and even chunks of metal fly off the roof and damage vehicles they refuse to be held accountable and instead blame it as an “act of God”. 

Flip side is they don’t charge you any extra for roaches, bed bugs, mice and rats."
1363,TRISH PETZOLD,GUELPH,"This landlord is rude, fails to communicate appropriately, illegally evicted myself and another tenant. She leased an illegal bedroom. Made false promises and then went against the terms of the signed lease."
1364,SHAWN BILLINGSLEY,NORTH BAY,"When landlord took ownership of the property that we had only occupied for a few months he requested for us to draft a list of items that needed repair. Months and months go by with no repairs completed or even started. The only weathertight door to our apartment had a large hole in it that the previous tenant placed there to make it easier to serve her clientele.  Needless to say in Northern Ontario a big hole in your front door let's alot of freezing air in and alot of paid heat out.  Temporary fix was a wee bit of insulation and a cold air return vent you would see indoor for a heating system, on each side of the hole. When the warmer weather came request was submitted to replace the door. (Bylaw in our city stated this is a required item and is owners responsibility).  Response was he would get someone to install a door but we were responsible for purchasing it. - uh no. Many of the items that were noted in the tasks to do were actually bylaw infractions.  If i was smart i should have revealed to our city bylaw enforcement. Once i signed the eviction i was not able to submit the infractions as it would be taken as retaliatory. This inability for me to file complaint save hundreds of thousands of $ for him. 
Lets just say the list of violations was lengthy. Communication-he his a downright bully. Has no problem talking down to you and mentioning he knows more as he had worked years in real estate.  It got to a point that i was required to attatch and highlight our provincial landlord and tenant act to any email i sent as he my ideas were simply pulled out of thin air.  No action and never appology when i was correct. Finally after numerous threats of eviction with no validity he came up with an eviction to move a family member into the unit.  That was his only legal route.  At this point I had enough and agreed. Needless to say with little housing we became homeless 4 months all possessions in storage and had only the bare necessities to hold our family together.  We did find Temporary shelter from the winter elements in my father's garage until we found an apartment.

This is the typical 'slumlord'.  Absolutely demands the $ yet will do nothing for it."
1365,THE SILVER GROUP,SAULT STE MARIE,They gave me above the legal rate of rent increases and in the past 2 times I have rented from them both times they have entered my unit without permission .  Absolute scum of the landlord society
1366,BOCAN ENTERPRISES DONWOOD PARK APARTMENTS,GREATER SUDBURY,Apartments are horrible!! Repairs don't get done.  Buildings should be torn down.  They are not maintained or cleaned.
1367,ACSO P.M.,KITCHENER,"We have had many concerns with ACSO P.M. in the past. When repairs are requested from tenants their response is often ""we've given your contact info to the <tradesperson>"" and that's the end of the chain. If the person never contacts you, expect it never to get repaired. Repairs will often takes months and will be met with delays, gaslighting, and direct disrespect by Diane, the key property manager. They have taken down the ""community posting board"" in the laundry room because another tenant was posting about tenants rights; and will charge a tenant $50 an hour to request any security footage. They insist on ""perfection"" in any work done, yet the numbers on the stairwells are literally spray painted on. 
There are also concerns around communication with Diane, who will often email at the late hours in the night or very early hours in the morning with emails that don't quite make sense, usually with contradictory statements immediately after each other or riddled with very obvious typos."
1368,GWLRA,TORONTO,"Avoid at all cost, security is major issue. theft inside the premises and laundry room, unauthorized entry, homeless staying on stairs, low value for rent, etc"
1369,ORION PROPERTIES/SQUIRES APARTMENTS,ETOBICOKE,"Wallpaper falling off in the halls, carpets dirty, garbage falling on balconies from tenants above. Super says ""not my job"". No Property Management on site."
1370,GABRIELA SOKACOVA,TORONTO,This disrespectful landlord and her husband Joe do not follow the rent increase guideline. They do not provide N1 Notice of Rent Increase at least 90 days before the date of the rent increase.
1371,DON MACPHERSON (MACPHERSON REALTY),PETERBOROUGH,"Made us live in an apartment with a moldy bathroom. We did mold testing and it was very clearly mold. Applied to the board to have it fixed, he didn’t fix it all, so we withheld the rent as per the orders. We were harassed, car was damaged etc so we moved out for health and safety reasons since we also had 2 young kids. Now the board is trying to make us pay him 11k. Refuse to pay it. He’s also made seniors in a 6 story building go without an elevator, doesn’t give 24 hours notice and complained of us requiring him to do so, doesn’t give back the interest on LMR, repairs either don’t happen or take months/years. For your own health and safety, run from this man and anything associated with his name."
1372,SMOOTH PROPERTY MANAGEMENT- MATTHEW TOUSSAINT,CAMBRIDGE,"The kind of landlord who throws dryer lint on your floor when you forget to empty the lint trap. Says that they have done you a favour by removing mold or performing basic landlord/property owner obligations. 
Kicks tenants out for reasons that do not come to fruition. Grossly overcharges for anything they can. The list goes on. 
All in all, a bad landlord and bad property management."
1373,DAN/BETH LACHAPPELLE,KEENE,"Worst place I've ever rented. Well water was contaminated. When any issue arose the landlords stated we had no rights. Run down, cochroaches, mold, filth and backyard stinks of septic leak."
1374,DONNA OSTOJSKI,KITCHENER,"We live in a triplex on the top floor and our landlord lives on the floor below. Unfortunately it seems Donna is suffering from some kind of mental illness. She has been constantly accusing us of smoking cigarettes in the unit (we don't smoke), leaving our windows open in the winter to cool her unit down as a form of harrassment (the heat doesn't seem to work her and she blames us), says people have planted any colonies in her garbage, called the cops on people for walking up the street and looking dangerous, stares at us through the window and when we walk our dog, blasts religious radio that echos in the halls, and has very loud church sessions alone in the shared hallway every Sunday. She incorrectly filled out a single eviction form and believed we were evicted and to leave but our lawyers told her otherwise. After speaking with our lawyer, it's really not worth going to court over and we are hopefully making our escape to a new building soon. I hope no one else will have the displeasure of living here."
1375,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"THE WORST SLUM LORD IN TORONTO- DO NOT RENT FROM THIS MAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. He is callous, dishonest, underhanded, manipulative, disrespectful, occasionally violent, disregards all health and safety codes, and shady as shady gets. The definition of a slumlord (who will drive his Maserati up to your building just to belittle you.) He purchased our small building with long-standing tenants going back 20 years- within 3-12 months every single tenant had left. He is that much of a nightmare. He will enter your apartment without notice, he will damage your personal property, bully you, rennovict you, ignore bedbugs, do the worst renovations, refuse to investigate health and safety issues (many he cause with his piss poor renovations) gaslight you, let meth dealers take hold in your complex without a care, lie to you, break all of the tenants of the landlord tenant acts, and try to strong-arm you into a million things that are against your tenant rights. People get so overwhelmed by his bullshit that going to the landlord tenant board doesn’t even seem worthwhile. The landlord tenant office knows him. The bylaw officers know him. It wouldn’t surprise me if the police know him- because he is shady AF. If you have it in you to fight him, lord be with you. If you aren’t living this nightmare hell scape yet and only considering one of his properties, I implore you for your own sanity, DO NOT DO IT. He is the lowest of the low low low and you deserve better. A squished piece of sidewalk pizza deserves better. Edward, if you’re reading this- you are a bad man, a bad human, and I hope you get the karma you deserve. (He tries to scrub his bad reviews off of the internet, fyi.) SLUM. LORD/ POS HUMAN. Save yourself the heartache."
1376,METCAP LIVING,ST. CATHARINES,Slum landlord. Cockroach infested units. Ants in the hallways. Broken doors. I could go on and on.
1377,METCAP INC,ETOBICOKE,"Landlord continues to show a lack of respect for women and for people of color in each interaction to the point where I refuse to go to his office unless it’s absolutely necessary. I would rather pay a service fee to pay rent than to speak with him. In addition to this, management also does not care. Aside from negative experiences with the resident manager, the building itself is kept clean, no one enters or can enter without buzzing."
1378,SUSAN SARANDON,MILTON,Always shows up without warning.
1379,KENLAR PROPERTIES,AMHERSTVIEW,"still trying to collect money from the year of no increases, even after advising amount being paid is accurate, constantly emailing notice to an email no longer valid, even after no less than a dozen requests to not use it, another also provided, notice of entries and then no shows, at least 4 in the last 3 years"
1380,ANDY REID,FITZROY HARBOR,"Andy would come into the home without notice or even telling me, while I was gone or out for a while. The roof also leaks and he seemed unconcerned, he refused to mow the lawn, and wouldn't offer a rent recipt for our 2 week stay. Would not recommend."
1381,PINNACLE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BELLEVILLE,Son of owner is a perv and unprofessional. I had prior damage to the apartment before moving in and damage was not repaired causing water damage to my personal property. Office lady was unprofessional and rude. I was lied to and treated poorly for the 3 years I lived in an apartment they managed. I asked prior to accepting the apartment if I was able to hook up washer and dryer on the existing hookups and was told yes they work. After moving in the hookups were not working and I called them and they told me they were shut off and couldn’t be used. Terrible experience. Stay away if you can.
1382,CENTURION PROPERTIES | 5249 DUNDAS ST W,ETOBICOKE,"Where to begin. The building claims to be smoke-free, but every every evening you have this awful smell of w€€d. The management does squat about it. 296 apartments lived with one operating elevator for a week, and you would need to take lots and lots of stairs to access the parking (talking about accessibility huh). And we had two operating elevators for 3 months, the lines were horrible. Then, during cold months there was a really strong wind coming from the windows, and nobody repaired that, even though we complained multiple times. Worth to mention absolutely useless staff who can’t perform even the simplest tasks. Overall, 1/5*. Would not recommend."
1383,BARRY COLGROVE,TORONTO,"He's a cheap, rich dick, but lazy enough to not cause problems for tenants. The only time I hear from him is the annual rent increase letter - which is (of course) the max amount he can raise prices. Superintendent in my building is pretty great and is the main point of contact. I belong to an often-discriminated-against group (I'm not gonna say which one) but haven't had any problems."
1384,NINA SAVICH,GUELPH,"Nina was told multiple times over 3-4 months about a continuous racoon issue in the attic. She failed to control this issue as she wanted to save money and do it herself. When she finally did, the racoons had dug from the attic to the basement in the walls of the home. She was convinced she got rid of them, though leaving a ladder and insulation all over the house and area by the attic as well as never moving the laundry machines back. The racoons were not gone and we told her this as well as sent a video of a hole exposed to the outside backyard into the attic. She did nothing. Additionally she regularly entered the home without telling us she was coming. She regularly did things ""on the cheap"" such as fixing the stove herself, which did not work the first time, and then the oven as well which meant waiting for when she was available. This left us without cooking appliances for at least a day."
1385,PREM PALTA,OTTAWA,"Dangerous, Illegal, Avoid at all costs."
1386,JEFF SHAW,ST. THOMAS,"Jeff Shaw is professional, courteous, respectful, completes repairs and maintenance within 48 hours. He follows everything a landlord should in the RTA. Good landlords are hard to find, he is a gem."
1387,NIGEL D’SOUZA,TORONTO,He is a lawyer so be careful. He’s very condescending and never prompt with replies about issues with the unit.
1388,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"York property management SUCKS!! 

They are rude, they don’t do repairs, they try to make remnants to the Landloard’s job (snow removal, etc), they evict people/families from units who don’t deserve to be evicted, they don’t work with tenants to try to help them when they are in need of anything, they hardly have lawns taken care of, they have tried to make tenants remove all belonging from backyards, they don’t do pest control when brought to their attention, they just don’t care about their tenants. 

York property management has evicted a single mother (with young children) who was a victim (and survivor) of domestic violence that ended with the abuser being removed and arrested by police for attempting to take her life. 
York refused to work with her after being informed of the situation, took the matter to the courts and when York “won” they left this single mother with less than 2 weeks to be out of the home. 

-10/10 rating for York property management."
1389,NORTH EDGE PORPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,"The building is filled with bedbugs, cockroaches, mice, and ticks that are outside on the property. Maintenance requests go answered for months or get removed from the system. No one works on-site to speak with tenants or reply to emails. Yearly AGIs (Above Guideline Rent Increases). The superintendent does less than NOTHING. The landlord is also the CEO of the North Edge Properties  Management company, so that's a joke. The garbage chutes and the carpets in all hallways haven't been cleaned in over 10 years. Bathroom and living room ceilings caving in on people on multiple floors. Parking NIGHTMARE, google ""parking evictions 25 Mabelle Ave,"" update: 210 parking spots and visitors' parking was removed to build a condominium that the city of Toronto denied."
1390,FILAMENT REALTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,Filament Manages nothing and is just complacent. They do not answer the phone to fix anything or take care of their buildings. Some of their buildings in the east and west ends of Ottawa are gross. Avoid them at all costs.
1391,BRENDEN MULLIN,RIDGEWAY,Stay away TT
1392,TOMASZ OLECH & URSULA REMBISZ,BRANTFORD,"Paid my rent. Caused no problems. 
They refused to address any of the issues caused by the other tenants: drugs, fights, parties, bands, threats etc 

They never checked smoke detectors or fixed problems. Went days without a toilet once. DAYS before we even heard back from them."
1393,SARAH STANSHALL,HAMILTON,"Sarah and her boyfriend Richard are HORRIBLE people. They harassed us continuously for crazy things we had no control over. They cut down trees and threw them in the back before we moved in. When we were there, the city came giving a notice to clean it. They tried forcing us to clean it and when we refused they threatened to evict us and Richard got verbally abusive and aggressive. 

Sarah continuously tried to have us removed and evicted for LIES. she took us to court for false information and we won. She tried taking us back again claiming her mother was moving in yet she just wanted more money. We won't that case too. 

Her own boyfriend told us as tenants that she doesn't fix things propperly that she does a ""lipstick"" fix. Basically meaning she tosses paint on it and that's all. There was mold, leaks, fire hazards, mice, cockroaches and more and she NEVER fixed anything unless we called the city and they MADE her do it... be aware abd DONT rent from her."
1394,GREENWIN AND SANDRA SMITH,NORTH YORK,Horrible management. Hot water virtually nonexistent. Zero security. Management is abusive and racist
1395,HAZELVIEW PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Very oppressive landlord that has little to no respect for their tenants. 
Will never do repairs unless the city gets involved."
1396,DERRICK PARSONS,COURTICE,Was great for the first year or two then started to get really flaky. Always complained about money. Made comments about how we assumed money grew on trees ect. Became really petty near the end of our tenancy. Repairs were made but not in a timely manner and often did it using things he found used.
1397,PAUL PARADIS,SUDBURY,Cares about his tenants. Does a great job.
1398,DMS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BRANTFORD,"With respect to the questions above I give management a positive rating. However building security is another issue because it does NOT exist. Anyone can get into our building at any time, and do. This means that tenants no longer feel safe, especially in stairwells and the parking garage."
1399,REALSTAR,ST. CATHARINES,Management seems to care more about visual appearance of the lobby/building than actual upkeep and maintenance
1400,PETER LENDAK,ELLIOT LAKE,"He never did repairs on our place, had leaks and holes in our house the entire time we lived there. Our furnace got recalled and he didnt replace it for an entire year or two. Illegally evicted us saying he sold the house, then put the house back on the market for renting at a higher price because we were paying hundreds less than newer tenants of his."
1401,DANA MARSH,LONDON,The property management team is horrible for helping tenants.   I was assaulted in my parking lot by another tenant because the staff would not enforce the parking policy.
1402,FALSETTO GROUP,OTTAWA,"Generally okay but certainly only do the bare minimum. The property was in reasonable shape. Repairs took a long time to be completed, but were completed eventually. When bedbugs were discovered, the landlord initially tried to say that I, a young female student, was responsible for fumigation costs and refused to budge on this issue until my father got involved. Fumigation was promptly arranged after that, and no further issues with bedbugs or other pests were noted."
1403,JAMES CHRISTIE,HANOVER,James is a narcissist who threatens everyone
1404,HAZELVIEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,It’s a massive company with the knowledge that if they raise rents excessively they will inevitably have their current tenants move so that new tenants can come in at new rents that are higher. It’s crap
1405,GHAS BACHIR,NORTH YORK,Bachir will threaten to evict his tenants and enter the property at any time. He has no respect for anyone who rents from him.
1406,MONIKA MACIEJEWSKI,NORTH YORK,"Monika is a deplorable human being. Disrespectful, arrogant, unprofessional. She makes arbitrary decisions, unlawfully enters units, and makes up reasons to fine you with no evidence. If you ask for camera evidence of any of her delusional fines ($600-$900) , she threatens to fine you for harassment. She shouldn’t have her management license let alone a job working with condo owners. She’s a scumbag who steals cash  elevator deposits and puts it to her unjustified fines."
1407,HASSEY MANAGEMENT,BARRIE,"Acting solely on behalf of the property owner, repairs are done by incompetent trades. 0 preventative upkeep or maintenance, cheap furnace filters, ducts never cleaned, parking lot never cleaned fully or promptly after a snowfall, sidewalks cracked, curbs are a trip hazard as are front decks and railings. Major repairs are done without a building permit and the rise and run of staircases are off, creating a trip hazard. I would avoid any property Hassey “manages”, they do not act or care about tenants. The building super does their best, hands tied by cheap owner and Hassey."
1408,SULLIVAN-GREY LTD. (JAMES CHRISTIE),HANOVER,"James Christie actively records audio and video of his tenants including inside his apartments. He threatens them and breaks lease agreements and tries to illegally add surcharges to your bills. He stands outside your apartment and bad talks you to other tenants just so that he can try to have the neighborhood turn on you.

The man believes he is the ultimate authority and will try to tie you up in court should you do anything less than what demands. He's sued almost every tenant he has. The man is severely mentally ill and should be avoided at all costs.

"
1409,FRED GRODDE,OTTAWA,Kind and fair landlord. I have recommended several friends and family live in their building 
1410,ADRIAN RANSOM KEY PROPERTIES GROUP,KITCHENER,Not trustworthy
1411,AMETHYST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SUDBURY,"Mark and Shallen are easily the best landlords I’ve ever had. The house is in excellent shape, and they truly care about not only maintaining their property, but also ensuring their tenants are happy. They are incredibly responsive, keep on top of maintenance and repairs, and are just genuinely kind people. I would rent from them again in a heartbeat!"
1412,CAPREIT,ORLEANS,"Capreit habitually violates human rights, they have been taking to the Human Rights Tribunal many times and lose but NDA's are signed so it's never reported on."
1413,PROPERTY2PROPERTY,HAMILTON,"Don’t be fooled, Elizabeth and Rick are some of the worst in Hamilton. They have no idea what they are doing, which will just lead to major headaches every step of the way. They ignore any repairs (lack of heating, no hot water, infestations from neighbours) yet always want their money. They ignore the landlord tenant act like it doesn’t even exist. They also have been known to rip off trades people. They are abusive and intimidating and lie lie lie like saying the heat is working when it clearly isn’t in the middle of winter. They have a long track record of bad business in Hamilton. Rick has also been know of sexually harass and threaten woman. And there’s the time, he almost got beaten by the cops, after a tenant called the cops on them. I could go of forever. Do yourself a favour and save yourself a headache."
1414,HAZELVIEW,OTTAWA,"Having lived with Hazelview for 5 years, I can say that I have improved quite a bit since the name change, seem to be doing more work in the housing community my building belongs to, and are cleaning more."
1415,ANDRE LEMIEUX,SUDBURY,"Horrible Landlord, Would show up without permission to walk the land and try to come though the house, refused to hire pest control when the house was riddled with mice, house filled with black mould, illegally tried to enforce rules not allowed by the landlord remnant board, did not follow any rules put out by the landlord tenant board,,, refused sublets."
1416,SUMAN AHUJA,PARIS,Couldn’t be more hands-off. We’ve never met our landlord. Our rent is low and she is non existent.
1417,ADRIAN KADONAGA,HAMILTON,"Nothing but a fabulous landlord, gets things fixed right away. Respects you and is amazing to rent from. Never a comaint in all of 6 yrs."
1418,CLV,TRENTO,Awful. No other words.
1419,ANNABELLE SARZANA,TORONTO,"I spent 1 year there,  and she is a Terrible Landlord. I will stick with what I can prove. 

I left the house because once she messaged me at 1am, saying that my rent would increase by more than the Ontario limit, and the increase would be before 1 year lease! She disrespected her own lease. 

After I left, took her 2 days to e-transfer the security deposit, because, according to her, she was not feeling well. 

Very sly person, always playing the dumb and forgetting convenient things, love to corner people to do what she wants. I definitely do not recommend."
1420,STERLING SQUARE APARTMENTS- MAINLINE LIVING,BRANTFORD,"I feel very good about where I’m living, there is a gym included with the rent. It’s a new build, well maintained and they clean all the common spaces once every 2 weeks from the looks of it. Unfortunately the nice lady in the office has left not sure who’s going to replace her but it’s a decent place to live in a decent part of town."
1421,AVIRAM GAZIT,TORONTO,Prone to exacerbate tensions between tenants. Not to be trusted. My wife was pregnant at the time and she developed severe allergies after he didn’t tell us he used to live in our apartment with a cat and the two other tenants owned cats.
1422,SIGHTLINES HOLDINGS,GUELPH,"Slumlord city. Patrick Campbell is useless as a LL. Have vermin, rodents, repairs, he does NOTHING. Avoid Sightlines as much as possible."
1423,CAPREIT,QUINTE WEST,This is the largest landlord in Canada.  Their priority is profits for the shareholders.  I live in a mobile park.  I own the house and lease the lot.  In the summer we have constant water shut offs to repair broken water mains.  The majority of these breaks have occurred on my lot.  I have structural damage to my house and  have had my insurance cancelled due to cheap fixes.  This has been going on for three years.  I have filed with the LTB.  Last year they threatened me with eviction and also called the OPP to try and have me charged with assault because I told the maintenance man to leave my lot.  I had emailed the office stating he was not to be on the lot I lease.  I had previously made complaints about this man being on my lot without notice and destruction of my property. The OPP advised me to place a notice of trespass and made it clear to the office and maintenance staff that I was within my rights. I am still awaiting my hearing with the LTB  In the meantime they are now applying for AGI for work done over 5 years ago.  Stay away from any dealings with this landlord.  Many complaints from across Canada.  Check out CAPREIT: Landlord of Negligence  on Facebook to see many other compaints from this landlord.
1424,LAURIE AND ROBIN L,HANOVER,"Laurie drove by the home 4x a day, she would find our family out for family walks and would drive slow beside them. Robin often brought machinery and tractors to the property at night 10:00 p.m. Both of the landlords frequently brought over lawn chairs, and set them up facing into the living room window, they would bring beer and sit and watch us. In the fall they removed the fence and back deck without warning, the screwed and boarded up the door from the outside. They had a inspection down without warning, when my wife was in labor, they demanded we return home asap to let them in. They sent us the bill for the ""cancellation"". When the fire inspection was done, the worker instructed them to remove the wood on the back door as it was a fire exit. They severed us numerous falsified ""notices"", when asked about our plans for moving, we communicated we had no plans to move, a N12 was served the following day. Laurie called the local child and family services, receiving the disclosure, there were many lies reported to child services."
1425,PRINCETON MANOR,SCARBOROUGH,"Cockroaches and bedbugs. The pest control is pathetic,  they try to deal with infestation with a few spots of gel."
1426,JUDITH GA,NORTH YORK,Arrogant woman and a liar! Scam artist. Rents houses and uses them as Airbnb without the knowledge of the home owner and doesn't pay the rent either
1427,FALSETTO GROUP,OTTAWA,…
1428,1336 KINGSTON RD INC,TORONTO,"This landlords are pretty bad. They do the bare minimum of what is legally required and less than that if they can get away with it. When they first bought the building they were entering units without permission for ""insurance"" reasons until a tenant told them that they weren't allowed to do that. They have applied to have the building demolished to build a new one to get around rent control regulations. Since they applied, they have stopped caring for the building. Cleaning in the common areas is done on a wildly inconsistent basis (it seems to be done when they have  showings for available apartments). There is regularly trash strewn about on the lawn and the green space in the back is not maintained. They take days to shovel snow, if they do it at all. When they do it, it's just a narrow path, not the whole sidewalk. When people move out, they renovate the apartment and charge 2-3 times as much but the renovations are done poorly, with new appliances that are laughably small and break easily. They shut the water off multiple times a month with 1 or 2 days notice and keep the temperature remarkably high in the winter (tenants do not control heat). They are overall cold and uncaring and seem to treat tenants as numbers on a spreadsheet. They forget that this is more than a business venture, this is our home"
1429,JANE MCNAMARA ZOSCHKE,BRACEBRIDGE,"This person purchased our duplex April 2022.  She made a point of wanting the tenants to stay. On April 29th she issued N12  notices as it was her intent to move her mother and a care giver in.  As of this date. 3 lawyers, the local OPP are amassing files  against this woman.  Everything from stalking, failure to maintain, harassment, mischief.  The N12 application was withdrawn as it has far too many errors.  New N12 forms have been issued stating she is moving in.  I could spend the next full day listing every infraction of the RTA, the Human Rights Code and the Criminal Code of Canada but will only issue this warning.  As of right now there are 7 tenants in Bracebridge that she has tormented.  She has no respect for any of laws at all.  Please stay away from this woman."
1430,RUBINI SHANMUGALINGAM,NORTH YORK,She's crazy! Fights with every tenant abd no one lives the entirety of the lease. Windows are too small as she has put walls between rooms and split rooms into two. Dont rent at her dump!
1431,RENEE MANAGEMENT,EAST YORK,"They have regular unjustified rent increases. The security is zero. You need to wear a mask entering the garage since it is filthy full of dust, grease, and bad odors of garbage. The elevators are always dirty, greasy and smelly. The hallways are cleaned once in a blue moon."
1432,AXON PROPERTY MGT,KINGSTON,"Amazing and friendly staff, quick to fix issues or send out overnight emergency team for lack of hot water / no heat, maintenance on the house is well looked after and small things like bulbs, doors that need fixing are done within a day or two, keeps yards and driveways clear. We've rented under Axon for 2 years now and are so grateful for the quality of service provided."
1433,CAPRIET,LONDON,"200 Sandringham Cres., is a nightmare! Elevators are either broken down or on service. Cigarette smoke dominates the air in the hallways. Creeps into your apartment and it’s as if people are smoking in your private space. Can’t open a window because of all the weed smoking on balconies. I once left a window open overnight, came back the next day to a fog of pot smoke in my apartment!! When there is a power outage, the overhead doors in underground parking don’t always work when the power comes back on. Had to call the fire department to get Capriet to open the overhead door!"
1434,ILONA YEHIA,HAMILTON.,Ilona is a great landlord  and take very great care of her tents by helping  them out and doing her best to show she is a perfect  landlord
1435,JANICE AND LEON,TORONTO,"Listen, stay far from any unit that these 2 slumlords are renting. All they care about is the money. Leon is unstable and pops up whenever he feels like without notification. The units are full of roaches. They will cut off your access to amenities such as laundry whenever they feel like and falsify documents. Many times Leon threatened with eviction, even though rent was always paid on time, without Janice even knowing. The left doesn’t know what the right is doing. But hey, take your own risk. Their units are even fit for the roaches that infest them!"
1436,BOARDWALK (175 EMERY W),LONDON,"The rent increases between tenants are ridiculous and the building is old and sketchy. The accessible doors to the building, elevator, and water in the building are always down. However - overall the building managers are kind, super responsive, very on top of pest control and fix maintenance issues in the unit very quickly. One of the better places I’ve rented."
1437,WILLIAMS AND MCDANIELS/WESTSIDE VILLAGE,COPPER CLIFF,"An absolute disgrace of a company. I would never recommend them to anyone in any city that they own property in. Pure corporate greed. They shouldn’t be allowed to own any apartment buildings. They will try to evict to raise the rent for new people. They will throw out your repair requests and claim you never submitted one. They bought the entire property in 2018 and the majority of the places there need extensive work. Steps are sinking, walls separating from base boards, huge cracks in walls, basements leak, illegal outside doors that are meant for interior, my list is extremely extensive also windows that don’t lock or close. I had windows that leaked for 7 years I lived there and they’re remedy was to flip the window panes around to fit better. I had to seal off the window completely to stop the wind,rain, snow etc from coming in…still to this day not fixed! Lmao it leaks worse. But they just like to put lipstick on a pig instead. Right? They will make your life absolutely miserable. Lack of maintenance and repair 100%. DONT EVER RENT FROM THEM. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF ANY WAY POSSIBLE AND WILL TRY ANYTHING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE HELL! This is from Westside Village property"
1438,RANEE MANAGEMENT,NORTH YORK,"This building is spotless. Well taken care of. The supers (Rosa and Alec) are amazing. I can't say it loud enough! Very quick to respond to any issue or complaint, and they always follow up in a very timely fashion. All cleaning staff are polite and thorough. Fantastic place to live."
1439,NHD DEVELOPMENTS (SOBARA COMPANY),TORONTO,"Non stop problems with pests and maintenance, landlord does the bar minimum.  Usually gives less than 24 hours notice for entering the unit. Refused to enter the unit if my dogs were home but I was not but would refuse to tell me what day they were coming in advance. Had a broken kitchen light and a broken electrical outlet for about 7 months. Building is dirty, so so dirty, super is non reachable and zero help for anything. Wish I never moved here and can’t afford to move right now."
1440,BOREAL ASSET MANAGEMENT,TIMMINS,Great response time with repairs. Good communication. Clean new units.
1441,SMART LIVING CANADA,OTTAWA,"Smart Living Canada’s property was disgusting when I lived with them. The inside shared spaces were understandably a bit dirty considering there were nearly 15 people in one ‘apartment’ but the exterior garbage area, which they claimed to maintain, was a disaster and at times unsafe.

Additionally, they were charging a furniture deposit at the time, which they would only return after months of pestering them. They claimed that only the company owner could issue return cheques and that they were out of the country for months at a time."
1442,MARTIN SIMARD,NORTH BAY,"For Martin Simard and his father Thaddeus/Norman Simard (apparently the father has been going by different names). will likely try to take advantage of you, so know your rights. No communication between landlord Martin and tenants at all, ignores phone calls and texts about serious issues. Sealed off back exit to make an extra room so now only has one exit and despite this still attempted to raise rent. Will not complete repairs that are necessary for safety (ie assuring doors and windows lock, structural safety, electrical updates). Martin and his father (who is NOT the landlord) randomly show up at the house without notice and rummage in the garage or around back. can also be disrespectful and condescending. before leaving his properties he didn't bother me that often until the ending months. He showed up at the house without notice screaming at us tenants when we tried to respond he would only raise his voice over ours, not allowing us to get a word in and not having a conversation."
1443,BOARDWALK - MAPLE RIDGE ON PARK,LONDON,"COCKROACHES! Just cockroaches EVERYWHERE. I used to visit my ex partner in this building around 2 years ago now. I’ve finally found a place to warn people, the bug problem got so bad even on the penthouse floor. There were even bigger ones on the first floor and basement level. Their only solution to the problem, was to put baited traps everywhere. The problem was this was only encouraging more to enter the unit. Not to mention the odour coming from the unit next to us was so awful i can’t even describe it. It was an absolutely abhorrent living situation and nobody should be objected to it. There was many reports to the office with photographs of the bugs, and the problem just kept getting worse."
1444,JOHN SOLTYS AND MAREK SOLTYS,WATERLOO,"The landlords are a father/son duo, and though they are often quick to reply to correspondence, action is not always timely and they are reluctant to hire professionals when repairs are needed, preferring to do it themselves - often inadequately. The father seems to have little respect for the exterior of the property, often using our yard to haphazardly store his surplus building/construction supplies, and dropping by at night to dump garbage bags on our curb (often days before garbage is even scheduled to be collected, which has previous incurred formal warnings from local by-law). 
However, they despite their short comings in property maintenance, the landlords are fairly agreeable. They respect our privacy, and don't often comment or complain about how we choose to utilize our space."
1445,HOMESTEAD LANDHOLDINGS LTD,KINGSTON,The roaches are a BIG red flag. Hope the building now owned under DMS properties fixes that dump. Glad we got out of there a few years ago when we did. Big yuck!
1446,TOM & LORRAINE O'QUINN,TRENTON,Great landlords! Very understanding and quick to fix issues when they arise. Definitely a change from other types of landlords we have had in the past!
1447,JOEY LEVESQUE,SUDBURY,This landlord is by far a joke. He doesn't even reside with in sudbury and orcastrates everything through his mother and is only reachable via Facebook. The noise complaints go unheard and good tenants go unheard. Every building I have attended has a infestation and I'll repair. He half ass repairs things. He takes advantage of the lower class people and addicts. He makes people get rid of their belongings when it doesn't fit his agenda. Creates issues with bylaw. Stairs took over a year to fix after bylaw made him due to fire codes. His one place went up in flames and he put lipstick on a pig and refused to let the same people move in. No matter what you do it's not up to this king and his mothers standards.
1448,BEDFORD PROPERTIES,BELLEVILLE,"Bedford Properties is one of the worst known companies in the gta. 
Between multiple news reports for renovation  evictions, to how standards are kept. 
Bedford does a once over pretting up the Properties they buy by glueing cheap vynal flooring, a coat of paint, and ""new"" appliances.  
Their maintenance is sub par to say the least as they have no care for the tenants, expect high rent for Cookie Cut Properties, long wait times for necessary repairs, and if that door doesn't shut properly its okay we wont fix it anyways. 
Amenities included are
 basement apartments- nightly floor sweats *so dont keep anything that might get wet there*, bugs, no soundproofing for that upstairs neighbor, extra fees for parking *60$ keys*25$ unknowingly sharing your neighbors hydro bill and more! 
Second floor and up- experience state of the art sinking balconies. That curve is no structural damage they were just updated in the 90s! Don't worry about the glue seeping through the floor boards, or that any appliance isn't properly mounted to counters just enjoy that they look nice! 
Every apartment has new and improved water savers that will give you a dripping shower worse than a gutter spout in the rain! 
We assure you this was done as fast as possible with all the corners cut! -literally idk where he tossed those things... 
Parking- when it snows we do 1 straight line down the center of the lot and expect you to care for your spot, but since your paying for it understand only cars go into it, no motorcycles, ebikes, big trucks, etc.
Theres no cameras so that we can keep the cost of parking low, after all we did just paint it. 
Come join our historic fight of making rent profitable and live in this wonderfully  Dealapidated Building for the price of a whole house! Cause why not pay for our lawyer! We need it anyways!"
1449,GABI BAKHOS,OTTAWA,This landlord failed to have repairs completed in a timely manner and some items took months or were never fixed. He additionally let himself into the apartment without any notice (even too-short notice).
1450,ELIZABETH MONTES AND HERNANDO MARTINEZ,CAMBRIDGE,Our time there was good but house needs a lot of maintenance. Hope they work on it.
1451,KEITH REYCRAFT,WOODSTOCK,Great Landlord!
1452,GOLDEN EQUITY,EAST YORK,"Horrible taken care of unit, they slap paint on anything n call it fixed, mold throughout bathroom!"
1453,HAILING CHEN (FIONA),TORONTO,"The landlord will not take care of the house ever. The only way to consider her come and repair any damages or infestations is by not paying the rent. Then get ready to get tortured. She is going to cut the power line, heater and start banging with utensils while you are asleep. She will repeat the above process like almost on an hourly bases. If you work from, then you are screwed even more because she is going to cut the power line every 23-30 mins between 9-5pm. I had to use hot spot just to work without the interference of the electricity being cut. You're letters and packages will be stolen, look out for that. I used to live on the second floor of the house and she literally came upstairs & started sleeping in the kitchen. She is a very big liar too, look out for that. She does not follow any LTB laws. Just don't live there is all I have to say."
1454,DR. JULIAN BOWER,TORONTO,"He once entered my unit with zero notice claiming an emergency.  The tenant below said to me later there was no emergency.

Soon after I moved in, I complained routinely about major big pests.  Occasionally after months of delay and after calling 311 it was looked into but he refused to spend proper money to solve the issue once and for all.  Major pest problem went on for five years and was never solved.  I literally thought about suicide weekly and my physical health took a huge nosedive which I have never recovered from.

311 never did anything.  I believed he paid off the swarmy city inspectors who would visit and literally look at me like I was the cockroach.  Vile corrupt careerists.

He bullied me into a lease weeks before I wanted it, but I blame myself for not walking away at that point.  I let him take advantage of my desperation not to be homeless.

He would slap illegal eviction notices on people's doors just to enjoy the look of terror on tenant's faces.  He did it knowing full well the LTB would toss these notices out.  He enjoys inflicting misery.

He underpays his staff and overworks them.  If they dare to complain he fires them without even trying to negotiate for ten seconds.  He's a shark who can't pass by a coin lying on the street.  He lives in a mansion worth $10 plus million but he will take you to LTB court for $43.

I could write a book about him.  I've never despised anyone more than him.  

."
1455,LIFE ON QUEEN / WESTWOOD HOLDINGS / DAVID WEISS,TORONTO,"11 buildings within this portfolio within the Beach neighbourhood.  Some buildings have the triple whammy of roaches, bedbugs AND mice.  Repairs are done by the cheapest contractor and you'll wait months for them to be done.  You can expect a rent increase every year although the standards for maintenance are slipping.  Hires staff but does not check references so you have no idea who is in your unit.  Always make sure you are home if access is required to your apartment. Would not consider any of these properties safe for women as superintendents tend to be misogynistic bullies Staff turnover including property management like you change your underwear:  frequently.   The only way to get things done when it comes to building standards is to call by-law to issue a mandate.  Your notices from access arrangements to rent increases are never in an envelope so everyone knows what their neighbour is paying for rent and in a rent controlled building it varies wildly.  Buildings that should be solid money makers are being allowed to deteriorate.  Avoid at all costs (the only reason tenants remain is to hold on to their rent controlled unit)."
1456,MEENA,MISSISSAUGA,"Meena and her husband were the worst people I've ever dealt with in my life. Where do I begin...the back door to the house did not have a functioning lock therefore it was ALWAYS unlocked. This issue was brought up multiple times and ignored. When the basement backed up and flooded they refused to send a plumber and instead she sent her elderly uncle to ""try and fix it"". The illegal basement apartment was completely full of black mold after some time with no idea why or how it started. The family members living down there had to move upstairs with us. The deck was also literally falling apart due to the fact that they didn't treat the wood when they built it so the weather changes over time caused it to decay. There were multiple holes that were about a foot long that they refused to fix. They were also supposed to and agreed to give us our deposit back after we handed our keys over, but never gave us anything and blatantly refused to. With just the few reasons of many that I listed I can honestly tell you the house should have been condemned. "
1457,HARLEY SMALLWOOD (ANDREX HOLDINGS),OTTAWA,"Been in our apartment for over 4 years now, and will likely stay put until we can afford to buy (or die I guess lol). The properties are well maintained, the rent increases aren’t bad (none in Jan 2020 or Jan 2021), and Harley was very understanding when our rent was late a couple times during COVID. He’s also very responsive."
1458,TAMMY TENNANT,LONDON,Landlord raised the rent exponentially. Was not flexible.
1459,QUADREAL,TORONTO,"Excellent building. Mostly pest free and landlords respond immediately for all pest or repairs related incidents. Big units, rent controlled. Highly recommend."
1460,PAUL ASTA,PETERBOROUGH,"Neglectful to property maintenence.  Pushy, affords no privacy.  Slumlord."
1461,PAL PROPERTY SOLUTIONS/SOLUTIONS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"Alex & Kaely were amazing landlords, and their team was also amazing. Always quick to answer emails and any concerns I had. Highly recommend. Did everything as per RTA."
1462,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS LIMITED,KITCHENER,"600 Greenfield Ave is a slum. The area is ridden with crime, so management is always hinting at it being the residents responsibility to keep the property secure. Fire alarm system is rigged to a speaker that goes right into your unit with the most invasive sounds every time they do their day-long fire alarm tests. Staff will pass messages by word of mouth sometimes instead of making an actual record, so things are always missed. If you do get a facility staff member to address your issue there probably won't be a replacement part until they order it (Maintenance staff are fine).  Cockroaches are a consistent problem that management try to address in the most intrusive ways and with little warning. Bed bugs have been sighted in some units according to the messages management sends out. If you have any self respect, unless you want to live in constant depressive, suicidal state of being, stay away."
1463,GREENWIN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Lies, harassment, threats, water in the walls, no need for heat in the winter because the building is so hot, broken stove, and fridge, bad pipes, too late to turn on AC while you're dying of heat stroke, leaky pipes, shocking at the electrical outlets."
1464,SAICKLEY PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"Lived at 405 Elgin for a number of years. The apartment has passed down from friend to friend so the rent was unbelievably cheap. It was probably the only reason I stayed because the building management and owners were awful. While we were there a rat infestation happened in the basement units, they didn't address it so the little buggers made their way up to our apartment. It took them over a month to address a broken fridge, and when they did the brought the wrong size so we had to wait another week. The would raise the rent depending on how many requests for maintenance you put in, so we had to be selective about what we asked for. There was hissing coming from our water radiator, which we talked to them about fixing. Nothing ever came of it an lo and behold the ceiling below us caved in from water damage. The building was horribly maintained in the first place, such a sad state of affairs give that it was a lovely old building that, in the right hands, could have been very charming. Laundry in the basement was always broken. On top of that, the people who ran it were extremely rude and condescending."
1465,NORTHSTAR CONSULTING,ALL OVER CANADA,Bullys and harassed there tenatns
1466,MEDALLION INC,OSHAWA,Ha! After 20 plus years of living in this building with multiple property management companies- Medallion has to be the WORST! 20 yrs of being able to sit on our ground floor patio that we pay a premium for only to receive letters today stating we need to remove all belongings from the patio and that patios are no longer allowed to be used for anything more than a fire exit and that if it is found we are using our patios for anything more than that we will receive notice of termination and legal action- So 20 plus years of access to my own outdoor space that we pay extra for - squashed to nothing/ if you value fresh air - don’t come here !
1467,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"Marda Management convinces Landlords to let them manage their properties than promptly let’s their properties fall into disrepair. Any request for repair or support from Marda is ignored or fought. Marda also
has a history of shady tactics taking advantage of young students and international students who may not know their rights."
1468,MANDEEP BINIPAL,BRAMPTON,I rented a home from this man for 13 years. This man has no respect for woman. He ignores any and all requests for repairs to the point that bylaw has to get involved. He also has a history of serving N12's. (Evection for personal use)  He has been caught peeping into the windows of the home and been seen sitting on the road in his car watching on multiple occasions. Stay clear if your looking for a place to rent. His family have multiple homes for rent in the Brampton area.
1469,MOHSIN IMRAN,WELLAND,Fantastic landlord and person who was very transparent and always took care of us. Unfortunately we had to move out of province so couldn't stay at the property longer however we had an excellent experience with him. Would recommend to all!
1470,HOMESTEAD,LONDON,"The building I am in (and am now leaving) is a 3 storey walk-up, that was clearly built in the 70s or 80s and not well looked after. All of the 'renovations' are bandaids that may fool you if you don't know what to look for. When I picked up my keys they told me they would do a walk through WITH me, she instead went ahead and did it WITHOUT me. They told me the unit would be cleaned and painted prior but it very clearly wasn't. There is mold behind the kitchen sink, and nicotine stains on the bathroom ceiling. Plus the patio door was stuck shut with what I think was icotine when I moved in. It also usually smells of mold and mildew in the halls. Their nicer high rise buildings are CLEARLY priority when it comes to maintaining and cleaning."
1471,STARLIGHT,ETOBICOKE,Never in my life have I ever imagined I would experience hate in the way we have experienced since this company has bought this place. As a form of therapy I started a Youtube channel to channel my anger by using humour to express issues. If you visit rebel tenant you can have a glimpse of the abuse tenants have suffered since they took over.
1472,NORMAND SIMARD,NORTH BAY,"Horrible experience, it took months to (barely) complete repairs as well blamed the length of completing repairs on the fact we were occupying the space we were renting. Was very unprofessional during many of our interactions and when asked about repairs or notified of issues with the apartment, that had been around prior to us entering the rental, he would blame it on us. Would regularly show up unannounced or late at night and when we would not allow him in due to it being past the legal hours of entry he would text/email us after calling us immature and rude. Very misogynistic and rude in most encounters. On top of that, the house was in disrepair with significant issues such as mold, broken windows, and a barely functioning stove. Would recommend staying far away from all his rental properties, and beware he consistently uses different names within his apartment listings."
1473,SUJAN SHAN,TORONTO,"Landlord suddenly changed their phone number. When we tried to call it was someone else’s number and they said that the landlord changed their number to evade taxes. 

Landlord also attempted illegal rent increases"
1474,BERKLEY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"As downtown buildings go, this one is pretty fair. The superintendent is responsive, considerate, and caring. Repairs are handled in a timely fashion, and maintenance repairs (e.g. elevator replacement, plumbing updates, etc.) are done proactively.
Administratively, they are pretty weak. They have one person managing the leases for 24 properties. Her response time can be anywhere from 2 months to a full year. Adding people to a lease, reconciling rent issues, transferring leases are all excruciatingly long processes. They have zero empathy or forgiveness for rent being late and refuse to handle any conflict or safety issues between tenants (e.g. one tenant threatening another, etc.)"
1475,MUHAMMAD F KHAN,BRAMPTON,"Khan Muhammad Furruck is a landlord from HELL! 

 Everything is a 1 but if I could say zero and have his license revoked as a ranking I would. 1. He illegally came into the home and put a lock box onto the thermostat.
2. Mice!!!!! Mice mice and did I say mice! He refused to hire the terminator to get rid of these pests. There were large holes underneath the footsteps, getting through the garage, and the backyard
3. There was a horrible leak in the roof. He only started to do something about it after there was a compliance letter from the Brampton town. 
4. FIRE SPARKED! Underneath the sink we have sparks and smoke flying because it was a circuit away from starting a fire. The fire department had to come. This landlord left a live wire exposed underneath the sink where a dishwasher used to be. He then tried to accuse us of putting a dishwasher there and then blamed our cats chewing on it. They would’ve been fried and dead. 
5. He would unlock the door and come into the house with an improper notice. (Sent a 3 am notice)
6. Would bring his dog without a leash or muzzle which is illegal in Ontario because his dog is a pit bull and around knowing we had small children.
7. Turned off the hot water and has turned off the electricity on us
8. The washer and dryer broke the first year and he never replaced it
9. We cleaned the backyard cause he refused to do it. 
10. Tried these long notices from 12 to 9 and then try to linger for as long as he can
11. End of the year contract instead month to month he threatened for a new contract for in crease from 2900 to 3600$ and another first and last months rent. Then harassed until we went to court and he lost both L1 & L2.
12. Brings strange people around the house. A worker went into the backyard and tried to break the window to the basement because I refused him inside the house. He thought I was a women home alone and tried to scare me. Husband was home.
13. Would go into our closets and cupboards and tried to take pictures of our belongings
14. He parked his car in the garage and he does not live at the house. Lied to the basement people telling them it is our car. 
15 1 am in the morning I caught him in the window with his phone and flash looking side my home. Several times he would stare at me from the outside looking inside.
16. Uses his body to push through his way through the door.
17. He does 24 hour notices EVERY SINGLE DAY
- Had to get a cease and desist
- Had to get a lawyer
- He purposely makes it difficult to live in the house 
- His one intention is to kick people out once every year so he can raise the rent to the market value. Plus greedy wanting more on top of it.
He tried to use dependants under the age of 16 as his reason to kick us out

Wanted to restrict any visitors to the house and would tell us he has friends around here to watch his tenants

He does not care about safety health
Invasive and very scary behaviour. I do not recommend ANYONE ESPECIALLY A SINGLE MOTHER THERE.

Basement is an illegal unit that he is renting out to people. It is a fire hazard in the basement. Fire department also clarified it

For 3 years the house did not have a proper fire alarm either for the whole house.
Will not give you your receipts at the end of the year either 
Put 100% of utilities on us when people live in the basement."
1476,TCHC,TORONTO,Takes months or a couple of years to get anything looked at or just get ignored
1477,FRANCA GIORDANI / FRANCA ARMATA-GIORDANI,NIAGARA FALLS,"Rented her house on Claude ave Niagara Falls, I lived in the basement and she lived upstairs. Everytime I’d leave she’d go into my apartment snooping around. Set up camera at my door which recorded audio because she accidently clicked talk and I could hear her speak bad mouthing me. Slashed my tires and threw nails in the driveway.. she wanted to sell so instead of offering me a month rent she illegally evicted me and stole all my belongings so she could do a vacant sale. Now lives in outer gta and actually works at a bank ironically enough. Beware"
1478,STARLIGHT,TORONTO,Place was a dump that had old stack plumbing. Our sink constantly overflowed with the neighbors dirty bath water. Building management was more concerned that the water didn't ruin the shit wood floors than anything else. The superintendent would also just show up with no notice and expect us to allow him to show the apartment
1479,YINGXIAN LI,TORONTO,"This landlord expects tenant to renovate her condo, brings tenants lots of trouble and deducts deposit for unacceptable reasons. Be cautious if you would like to rent her property on the 6th floor of 65 St.Mary St.."
1480,JIMMY AND AMY MELO,CAMBRIDGE,"Horrible humans who are the definition of hypocrites.  He is a pastor at a local church so while pretending they are ""helping"" the less fortunate, in reality they bought real estate during covid at an inflated price and tried to illegally raise rent to all current tenants and ignored any and all complaints including those of serious safety concerns, disputes between neighbours which included assault, threats, theft, noise etc. 

So while at church they help the homeless, in reality their goal is to make people homeless for their own personal gain.

 They are the definition of slumlords who threaten their tenants because they believe they are smarter and can trick them into agreeing to illegal notices.  No consideration for people's time, proper notice of entry, or any form of personal respect.  

He is an ex addict with an anger management problem who threatens women and uses his new ""faith in God"" to pretend he has changed and turned into a decent person.  We moved out because I did not feel safe being home alone with my young child with the landlord on the property.  He is condescending and threatening towards women and his wife enables his abhorrent behaviour, because they know that the rental market is insane and most people can be threatened and silenced into condoning their behaviour with the threat of eviction as they have nowhere to go."
1481,GREENWIN - 88 ERERSKIN AVE.,TORONTO,"Hood employees except for the manager - she screams & makes decisions based o weather she likes you (she’ll like you better if you are white and born in Canada).
Other employees are on but they have the manager to answer to so you’re always be in the wrong"
1482,PANORAMIC PROPERTIES,ST. CATHARINES,"Absolute slumlords, nothing is ever fixed and if it is, it’s a cheap band-aid solution (I.e. the sink water drain stopped working so they took the entire thing out and gave us a $1 plastic drain cap instead). The property manager, Deb, tried to arbitrarily charge over $3k in “damage fees” (including hundreds for cleaning) when we gave 60 day notice. There is no damage to the unit other than a screen we already had re-screeened at the time of the showing. They claim we have to have to done through them for $300. Refused to pay any of them as they’re unwarranted. Stay far away."
1483,ANDREW ST.JEAN,OSHAWA,This realtor has zero damns about anything you need and if he buys your property expect to be hit with a n12. He bought our triplex in April of 2021  didn't bother following our mediation settlement with the neighbors  instead he lied to us and we delt with them for over two years until he gave all three units n12s. Nothing got fixed even after multiple reminders . He doesn't follow ltb rules at all and relltaliates if you don't do it his way.  Don't rent from this guy it's a headache and a half
1484,ANDREW AGUIAR,TORONTO,"The property and unit were well maintained and in good working order, but respect for tenants and their privacy was a huge issue. LL lives in one of the units in the building, we would often find him throwing away other tenants’ mail and a handful of times our own mail was opened by him. He would often insist on entering our unit to do “safety upgrades” during times that coincided with us being away travelling, to check things that we had never flagged as issues and which were all outdated from well before we had moved in. The sudden urgency to fix things a year into our tenancy precisely when he knew we weren’t present made us uncomfortable. If you don’t “play ball” with this LL and voice an opinion that is at odds with how he runs the place, he will take it as a personal attack and deflect by making you seem like a “problem tenant.” Loved the location and unit but it was a major headache dealing with this guy that I would avoid at all costs, especially since he’s around all the time."
1485,BYRON RENTAL PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,"Took a year to treat a severe silverfish infestation, walls are falling apart as they’ve soaked up moisture, electrical is not up to code (everything in our unit except the stove was on one fuse, and one of the outlets would short out the whole unit if used at all) — super came into our unit with no notice while my wife was sleeping and refused to leave because they had prospective tenants, the hallways are falling apart, and the landlord has ignore instructions by the fire chief about the fire alarms — when they go off you will probably go deaf."
1486,DAMAC INVESTMENTS INC,HAMILTON,"Damac owns a bunch of houses in the summit park area behind Walmart on rymal rd east in Hamilton. We were the first tenants in a 3 bed 3 bath town. We were there for almost three years and never saw them once. They never inspected, never asked and never bothered us. When our dishwasher broke, they just have us the contact number to get a repair guy, they didn’t coordinate it. When we told them about fire alarm issues, no response so we dealt with it ourselves. Which honestly was totally fine cause they left us alone. Because they respected
Us, we respected their house and we’re excellent tenants. When we left we were told it was so clean, and they never came to us about anything after we left. They were most of the time very responsive, and over covid never raised our rent. When they did raise it they raised it a very fair 3% when they could of really jacked it. We were very lucky and would 100% rent from them again. We only left cause we had to leave the city for a job."
1487,MEIHUA WANG,NORTH YORK,"The couple is very stingy. The rent can be increased by 20% yearly, and they have a bad attitude. They like to plant their problems on the tenants and take the opportunity to evict them. Otherwise, the price will increase by 100%."
1488,CURTIS THOMPSON,ST CATHARINES,"Was a tenant at multiple of his properties over a period of 5 years. Super nice guy, handles issues quickly and is a totally reasonable person. You wont find a better landlord."
1489,ILONA YEHIA,HAMILTON,"I rented a room in the basement for 2 years while she lived upstairs, any concerns I had she always created solution and fixed problem. She was open to listening and I was very happy here and comfortable. Would rent from her again."
1490,COGIR,TORONTO,Rent it on high homes are old
1491,KRAFA MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,"Awful, rude, the worst at maintaining their properties. Secretary is short with tenants and snarky. Building superintendent where I am is a disgusting pig that makes sexually charged comments, makes sarcastic and gross comments when asked to do his job, does half-ass shoddy work and has to come 4-5 times for the same job or doesn't come back at all and denies any problems. Bug issues in our building with minimal/no treatment. Rent is cheap and price is all-inclusive however and we cannot afford to live anywhere else in the city so we are forced to live in disgusting, mold and cockroach filled buildings."
1492,GORDON WU,MARKHAM,He is kind and nice.
1493,ARMANI,WINDSOR,"Hires the worst property managers, is all over tik tok talking about how much money he makes with his rentals, could careless about his tenets, was suppose to have our property power washed last summer, never happened , grass barely gets cut,"
1494,FJM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"I've lived in a unit for over two years now and overall it has been a decent experience in terms of landlords. Most maintenance requests have been handled within 24-48h and I feel safe in my building, love my building mates, and rent is affordable.

Notably when I moved in the apartment had not been given any care after the previous tenant left meaning there were many dents and chips out of the paint and drywall from millimeter ones up to about 6cm across. Often maintenance is done as a quick ""patch job"" as opposed to properly repairing things (eg calking tiles back together instead of fixing grout).

There have been a few incidents of maintenance requests taking far longer than they should considering the risk involved (ice left on steps for 4 days and having to advocate strongly for specific maintenance during COVID - the latter might have been a failure of management to understand the risk/benefit and their obligations to avoid non-essential work in units).

People consistently smoke at the entrances, on balconies, and in apartments despite the buildings being called ""smoke free."" Landlord's efforts to dissuade this have been marginally successful. Laundry is not available in all buildings, is expensive, and not particularly user friendly (one small washer and dryer together meaning multiple trips)."
1495,STEVE (TRICKEY HOLDINGS LIMITED),SUDBURY,"My main complaint with this landlord was the lack of repairs completed in a timely manner, maintenance was constantly flaking on appointments for repair. 8 out of 10 times you'd be told the super was coming to repair something, you'd wait around and they would never show up. He was a very good person and I think Steve took advantage of him, he maintained too many properties and could not keep up. My unit was 'newly' renovated prior to moving in, it looked great but it had a lot of issues. Electrical in the entire apartment was completely messed up. At one point my fridge completely stopped cooling. It took almost 4 months before it was repaired. We had issues with the toilet, the oven, the lights, the washing machine.. The ONLY time they came and repaired any of the ongoing issues in the apartment was when they were putting the building up for sale. They got those issues figured out almost immediately. No one in the building ever had keys for the mail boxes that were open to the public. I only moved out because I was leaving town."
1496,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,KINGSTON,"I lived at the property for about 2 years. During that time they took care of 2 minor issues i had, and even replaced the tiles when the company decided to renovate the building. No rent increases even though the unit looked much more modern by the time we moved out. Building had some issues but most of them were related to some of the neighbours living around us, otherwise it would have been nice if security was tighter when local thiefs decided to have their way with our bike storage. Overall they were responsible and the supers were pleasant to deal with and knew most residents by name."
1497,LOUISE WALL,TORONTO,Terrible landlord. Absentee. Apartment has mould. Main door didn’t lock. Windows broken. Couldn’t get anything repaired. Made tenants shovel the walk and take garbage out because she wasn’t there to do it. Asked for illegal deposit and tried to contract out of the landlord tenant act. Basically preys on immigrants and students because she knows they don’t their rights. If you complain she tells you leave - knowing it’s impossible to find accommodation in Toronto. She’s a psychologist! She treats people who are mentally frail! This should hold her to a higher standard.
1498,MUHAMMAD J KHAN,SCARBOROUGH,"Horrible landlord dosnt fix issues in the house no respect for woman, starts illegal renovations without permits then tries kicking you out when you stop them"
1499,RAY FINI,TORONTO,"This landlord likes to serve bogus eviction notices. All apartments in these two buildings received an N12 for personal use even thought it’s technically owned by a numbered company, then an N13 for renovations too disruptive to live through.

They painted, fixed the roof, and rented the apartments out to new tent ants."
1500,JORDAN STEWART,VICTORIA HARBOUR,"This person is somehow a CCGS Captain for a living and can not behave within legal RTA regulations, he’s attempting a bad faith eviction of a tenant who was hurt on the property because of his negligence, even after his own insurance took responsibility he is retributionionally trying to evict the tenant for following their own legal rights, and submits false information to coverup his misdeeds to the ltb. This person texted the tenant “he would make sure the tenant would not want to stay” regarding the false eviction and has continued retribution and harassment and property damage for two years awaiting a ltb hearing. Disgraceful."
1501,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,Horrible. Abusive. Harassing. Homophobic.
1502,DEVCORE,CORNWALL,"Where do I start. Devcore are slum lords they ""renovate"" With the cheapest material and employees possible. And then when things break they refuse to fix anything. They hatrass, bully Intimidate, tenants in to signing away rights. I have been renting for 20 plus years and have never experienced a landlord as horrible as devcore."
1503,VAN PHUNG,WINDSOR,Building is infested with both roaches and bed bugs. Landlord does self service of pest control and will not hire a company. Building in serious state of disrepair. Onsite manager doesn't do anything but answer the door late at night to let people into units. Constantly have people hanging in and around the premises that do not live here. People frequently found in stairs late at night charging phones.
1504,WOLVERINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"Had to buy window screens and two bedroom doors, was told I'd be reimbursed..never got the money, then my ceiling caved in and was promised to fix it the next day knowing they were removing themselves that day from the property to give it another management company and told not one tenant they were leaving."
1505,ARMAND BEDERIAN,OTTAWA,"Condescending, aggressive, dishonest and cheap. Don't expect much from this guy."
1506,PETER YEN,GUELPH,I have lived in this house for 8 months and absolutely love it.  I am treated with respect and I know how much the home owners care.  I know they have had issues with another tenant and I am aware these tenants don’t care about anything or anyone. Thank you for taking care of everything with such care and concern. Great people to rent from.
1507,CANEK CO,MISSISSAUGA,"The landlord is useless, doesn’t respond to tenants requests in a timely manner. He only cares about his bottom line which is money."
1508,ADERITO ALVAREZ,TORONTO,"Aderito is by far not the worst landlord I've ever had. He is very informal, and doesn't know much about proper forms. But he also barely raised by rent in almost a decade. He is generally fair, although doesn't do a fast job of repairing things, unless it's an emergency. He's not perfect, but he's the least bad landlord I've had."
1509,SILVER GROUP& GRAND GARDENS,SAULT STE MARIE,"I have submitted multiple work orders and have holes in my siding, all of my sinks do not or are not in working order, leaks in roof, windows leave major drafts and costs a fortune to heat in winter. Basement leaks, all sinks leak, windows and doors not sealed properly and leak, missing base boards, cupboards hanging on barely, flooring is bad, shotty work was done. Nothing gets fixed. They cab plant trees and add new steps but cannot fix the huge sliding pieces that have come off the units, rotten window sills, wood exposed from outside. Bugs get in easily because gaps between floors and doors. My unit has structural and electrical issues for which it has been over two years and no one has come dispite my calls, emails, and talking to maintenance. Work orders from plumbers ignored when the plumber suggested redoing my tub surround and replacing the tub spout. Instead they left it so the mold is spreading. They should owe me for the cleaning supplies I've paid for. I've lived in several places and these places are the worst I've ever been subjected to."
1510,THE SUMMIT,OTTAWA,Average central Heating. Often feels cold in the winter
1511,LYDIA CHEN 89 BARONESS CRESCENT,"NORTH YORK, TORONTO","i wish i could rate 0 stars because Lydia Chen is a greedy, abusive, conniving landlord. She and her husband scam new immigrants/ international students into paying $100 to “reserve the place” when actually it’s a scam. They don’t give you a lease so they can harass you into leaving so they can scam more people. beware."
1512,MATTHEW MOXNESS (CPM) CRESCENDO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SAULT STE MARIE,"Don't rent from crescendo property management, they are in it for the money and don't fix anything. My partner and I at the time moved into a 2 bedroom house owned by Matthew Moxness, which we never spoke with he avoided anything to do with us or the property.  upon viewing the listing stated 1700 all included and that there was main floor laundry, after signing the papers they tried to up the price of the rent to 1900 not included but we reminded them that that's illegal and that we would want our deposit back (3400) they agreed to the price they had advertised after a bit of hassle which was unnecessary. The contractor was still working on renovating the bathroom and said it would be finished prior to us moving in, almost 2 months goes by before we moved in and upon move in date the washroom wasn't even usable, there was mold all over the ceiling and stuff left from the contractor all over the floor, nothing was touched, the entire back half of the house from the day we had went for the viewing. We called the office to get some sort of an answer as to what that was about and nothing took them 3 days to get back to us and said the contractor was needed at other properties,  we explained that the washroom wasn't even usable and that there wasn't even a washer and dryer like they said, they told us to use downstairs facilities till the contractor had time to finish, now a month goes by nothing from either and then one day after work I come home to the door to down stairs screwed shut which was where our only washroom was at the time, the door knob to the garage busted off and no notice of anything, turns out the property manager came over and didn't have keys to come in didn't give notice but felt it was okay to come in and damage the property, my partner tried to call the property manager no answer then we received a text that he admitted to coming in. Took the contractor 9 monthes to finish the property which included painting over the mold and half ass repair of the holes and missing tiles also left 2 prong plug ins all over which are not up to code.  The contractor would come once a week afterwards and complained the entire time about how the management company wasn't paying enough, he half assed all of the work, my partner and I ended up finishing the bathroom after one day he left and never came back. After about 10 months living there and everytime we needed something fixed never getting a response the property owner decided he was gonna sell our place with out telling us. The property manager said they werent in the business for renting and that they use people to fill their places in the time being while they flip and sell properties they also had people show up to the property expecting us to show it and that we would let them in, everytime we turned them away cause that's not our responsibility everytime they would show we would call to find out what's going on and was met with hostility from the receptionist at their office about us not showing the property  and even one time the property manager had the audacity to walk in without notice as well and show our place I was in bed sleeping and my partner was making breakfast just not right. this company is absolutely ridiculous they have no respect for their tenants and try everything in their power to get out of their responsibilities, they don't even provide snow removal or yard maintenance which is also illegal they expect the tenants to do everything and when called out for it they blately dont care this company moved into my town and bought up all the cheap properties to raise the rents and not give a damn about whats needed or necessary to keep up. If you have the chance to avoid this company do it! Not worth the headaches!"
1513,ROBERT AND DEBBIE BERTO,SAULT STE. MARIE,"The absolute worst. Only cared about money, not about tenants' health and well being."
1514,DREWLO,LONDON,"Drewlo 710 Wonderland, building manager is extremely rude and incompetent. They lie about everything and never provide accurate information. Stay away."
1515,ANDREJS RJABOKONS,NIAGARA FALLS,"Highly recommend!
No home inspections, does not bother the tenant. Provided extra, like furnace filters and driveway seal.
Best landlord I ever had?
5 out of 5"
1516,SUMMIT HOLDINGS,ETOBICOKE,Superintendent is extremely rude whenever we complain anything they said you can go somewhere else nobody stopping you give us notice and just leave your apartment.
1517,DR BENJAMIN GHOTBI,TORONTO,"This landlord bought the place from our previous landlords. He immediately downloaded his own responsibilities onto us regarding snow removal and yard maintenance. When we left I was in poor health condition because of the black mold riddled throughout this apartment. I started having seizures and was using 3 inhalers every day multiple times a day just to breathe. Turns out as the asthmatic, I was just most susceptible. My partner has since a polyp surgically removed from sinuses that was a product of the mold and my daughter’s “allergies” cleared up almost completely. The poor health this family suffered at the hands of a landlord that refused to even come look at the place when water poured from our ceilings was ridiculous.  Even when we gave notice and tried to move out, he let the new upstairs neighbours harass us for hours on the day of our move before they finally showed up and moved one of the two cars they had blocking the whole driveway so we could move out. He has tried to harass us many times since we moved out, I eventually had to block his number because of the harassment."
1518,URBANDALE CORPORATION,OTTAWA,Excellent Landlord. The best in Ottawa in my opinion
1519,SHELTER CANADIAN LTD,OTTAWA,When it comes to repair the bare minimum  is done if rents hadn't sky rocketed I would be out of here in a heart beat
1520,NIAGARA STUDENT HOUSING,WELLAND,"I lived in one of Dave and Jackie’s homes for three years, and I can confidently say they prey on students not knowing their rights. They don’t provide proper standardized lease agreements, they attempt to enforce rules that aren’t legal and therefore null and void per the landlord tenant act. 

On multiple occasions then and/or their employees entered our home and began harassing us with no warning. I witness Dave grab one of his tenants by the shirt collar and threaten him. 

Dave owns close to 30 homes around the college and puts cameras on the outside of most of the homes, so you have no privacy around your home. STAY AWAY."
1521,TAMARA CHOU,OTTAWA,"Tamara is a scammer, I might have got her last name wrong. She took our rent money every month and then didn’t pay our hydro bills for so long that we got a red notice that they were going to cut the hydro off immediately and tried to lie about it even though we were home when hydro came and left the notice. She would come to the house and collect EVERYONES mail. She would take this mail home and not tell you it arrived. She took a payday loan out using my name and legal address which was a huge mess for me to figure out. My identity also was stolen around the same time so I am sure it was all related to her since. There was black mold in the house and she didn’t have it fixed, when someone finally came to look at it the worker informed us that it wasn’t even safe to live in the home. There were bed bugs in the home right before we moved in and she didn’t inform us, downstairs tenant came by and let us know."
1522,KAP PROPERTIES,SUDBURY,"Kayla with Kap Properties was the worst landlord/property manager I've ever experienced. We never missed a single rent payment, never asked for anything that was unreasonable, never trashed the apartment. For one, our rental agreement had 2 completely different addresses on it (did not notice until after we moved out). We never met her, or the house owner. We were given a key via lockbox outside on the porch. Everything was handled by email/text message. We did a viewing with the tenant at the time and the place seemed pretty decent. Upon move in day, the entire place was trashed, old furniture and food in the fridge. Dirt and sand all over the floors.  The house had rats, mice, ants and moles. We demanded they send someone to clean, and she agreed. They hired a lady to clean the floors and that's it. There was grease up and down all of the walls in the kitchen we had to clean ourselves. They rented to us saying we had 2 parking spots. We found out she was telling the other units they also had exclusive drive way access and we had to share the drive way with both other units when they moved in. Causing arguments for months with one tenant where we had to get the cops involved constantly for her threatening to destroy our cars/property. The porch light was never fixed even though we asked because it was a shared entrance and dangerous in the winter.. They never once checked smoke alarms or fixed the dryer when we had issues. The rental agreement showed snow/yard maintenance was taken care of by the owner of the house.. We were constantly having to shovel the drive way/sidewalks.. Eventually we got a text right after Christmas saying the owner was renting to a family member and we had to move. She offered to pay our moving expenses as long as they were reasonable because of the short notice and breaking of the lease we signed. We never got a formal eviction notice, but were constantly being told a realtor was showing the house and needed access to our unit. We refused to let them enter because we were not given notice. She turned nasty and refused to pay moving expenses/communicate to us. We eventually moved out and we found out they rented out our unit right away. I asked for rent receipts it took 6 months and eventually she googled a sample and wrote out the amount and names on top using MS paint. I give them a 1 for absolutely everything."
1523,COMPTEN,MISSISSAUGA,"Went into the tenancy with a contract that said no smoking. I was also told that the place would be done renovations a month before I was moving in. Turns out, they finish renovations the day before I move in, so I ended up with the options of breathing in lacquer fumes if I leave the windows closed and cigarette fumes from both neighboring apartments if I left the windows open.

I chose to move out as soon as possible, but it turns out it's a one year contract, so they pursued the rest of the contract through the LTB."
1524,SUMMIT HOLDINGS,ETOBICOKE,"Well we sit in roach infested apartments with everything falling apart around us, the 4 brothers that own summit holdings are sit in there winter homes in Miami. They also have summited for above guideline rent increase of 3% for the cosmetic changes to the outside of the building. All well the water system is falling apart and some apartments are still on glass fuses. They barely give 24hr notice for water shut off and entering your apartment. If I could afford to move I would but they should be held accountable for the crap job they are doing. They are all doctors and lawyers; this is just additional income for them. They have no regard for those who live in the properties they own."
1525,NASIRA NASIM,KITCHENER,"I rented a unit from Nasira Naseem and her partner, Masoodur Darr in Kitchener, Ontario. The unit was above her office in a home. At first, things were great, but they moved out of the office and things began going downhill from there. It was clear they treated us as investments, not as tenants. During the pandemic they alerted us they were selling, and strong-armed us into agreeing to a flexible arrangement with the realtor to allow showings on short notice. Ended up playing host to multiple unmasked tours a day, sometimes without any notice at all. It got bad enough we spoke to the press. They did not respect our space, privacy and treated us with derision as time went on. Worst landlord experience I have had, and I have had a lot."
1526,CAPRIET,LONDON,Never fix what they say they will fix. Building is always Smokey and no one confronts tenants about their habits. Smoking include marijuana. Loud noise also goes unchecked. Rent is $2k for a small two bedroom. Handymen have no clue what they are doing when they do attend. Door that was cracked when moving in was never replaced.
1527,JON,OTTAWA,Jon the land lord of 160 lavergne is the worse I’ve ever had. He does not do anything and the place has bugs and crack heads living in it .
1528,BEDFORD PROPERTIES,ST. CATHARINES,"Terrible building, property manager and corporation.  You definitely do not want to live at 137 Church.  The building is in great need of repair, especially the north side plumbing from top to bottom.  Add in ineffective management, lack of noise control, no security (repeated underground garage vandalism), renovictions (including one of a dying man).  Do not take my word for it - do your own research.  Google is your friend.  Bedford Properties, Rentitornot, Mark Knodell, Trenton, Cornwall, Bedford Properties + renoviction, ""'Renoviction' proceedings stopped against St. Catharines senior with terminal cancer"".  I'm sure you get the picture."
1529,JOHN HOOD,MISSISSAUGA,John's been a wonderful landlord. Prompt to address any concerns and always incredibly kind. I've lived here since mid-2019 and feel really lucky to do so.
1530,MIKE MACEROLLO,TORONTO,"Overall decent but refuses to do anything about loud renters in the house. 

Do not rent here."
1531,METCAP,ETOBICOKE,"Horrible company. Since taking ownership of 201-205 The West Mall in 2020 the property and living standards have gone downhill. They removed the recycling bin so now the garbage bin is always overflowing and garbage is all over the lawn. It is also attracting rodents. 

They have tried to enter the unit without giving the proper forms. The staff is extremely rude to tenants. They have made some upgrades to the units (low flow toilets, painted the parking garage and balconies). I believe they made these repairs to try to get an Above Guideline Increase from the LTB but were denied.

There is a reason why Metcap wins the Golden Cockroach award year after year!"
1532,ANDREW CHANG,TORONTO,"Absolutely horrible landlord, have a number of long-standing unresolved maintenance issues. Hides behind his property management company, and they simply say “go to the LTB”."
1533,ANDRE ALBUQUERQUE,TORONTO,"Andre Albuquerque is an amazing landlord who truly goes above and beyond for his tenants. His caring and respectful nature is evident in every interaction, and he consistently demonstrates a level of attention and care that is truly unparalleled. In a world where many landlords are solely focused on maximizing profits, Andre stands out as someone who genuinely cares about the well-being of his tenants. He is always available to his tenants and takes the time to ensure that their needs are met. His units are always clean, well-maintained, and equipped with everything that his tenants need to feel at home. Overall, I highly recommend Andre Albuquerque to anyone looking for a caring and respectful landlord in Toronto."
1534,TOM ROSA AND JOHN CARLOS TSILFIDIS,TORONTO,"Tom and John signed a residential lease with us and then harassed us with invalid eviction attempts. First they tried to evict us as commercial tenants so they could give our apartment to the scam artist they moved in upstairs (she was charged Samantha Stevenson or Evanna Lopez as she tried to go by, many news articles on her) they then let this scam artist harass us. The scam artist and her family did everything to try to make us leave from keep our apartment at sub-legal temperatures because the controls were in their unit to they would intentionally make loud noises in the middle of the night to physically intimidating us to making a false claim about us to police when she was caught driving her 2 young kids off without car seats to deflect from having driven 2 young children in car seats. We had recordings, we had paper trails, we had proof and this landlord did nothing about it. During the harassment, the landlord attempted to evict us 3 more times, all illegally. The landlord also revoked the backyard amenities when the neighbours moved in and offered to pay for exclusive use. Tom Rosa tried to get my partner in trouble at work using his position in the same company as part of their tactics to get us out. When they finally realized they couldn’t pull a fast one on us and the scam artist was charged leading to a quick midnight move leaving them high and dry, they sold the house but not before trying to illegally evict us during the process by claiming the house was already purchased and had to be empty for the new owner, the realty company said otherwise and then suddenly we were kept out of the loop entirely. I wouldn’t rent from these people ever again and wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy."
1535,OLIVE CORP,AJAX,You don't need to worry about privacy. They won't come for any reason even if you're asking them to fix the sewer water lealing everywhere. At least they'll tell you not to use your front yard.
1536,MEDALLION,TORONTO,"Terrible landlords. Property at 120 Shelborne is filthy, they ignore and erase maintenance requests. See the CTV article about the protests."
1537,CLV GROUP,GUELPH,"There is literally not enough time to write how bad this company is. They disrespect their residents. They do the bare to less than bare minimum. Mold filled health hazard apartments. They rent to anyone and bad, loud, Potentially dangerous residents are not dealt with. They have ZERO building security. Any work that is dont is completed by the cheapest contractors they can find. They charge high rates just for a parking spot and barely plow the lot in winter leaving a dangerous and hazardous environment for the disabled, elderly and children to navigate in winter. They love to call minimum work on buildings capital investments as na excuse to get much higher increases in rent.  They put laminate floors in old buildings with NO soundproofing between floors creating a horrible living space for residents. Complaints are not dealt with and police have been called so many times to their buildings in some places the police don't even bother showing up to respond anymore. They charge premium rents for apartments that are barely anything modern whatsoever. Hallways stink often from god knows what."
1538,JDN,LONDON,I've never been treated so poorly. They do not care about anything but money. Everything is a patch job. Avoid!
1539,OWNERS MANAGEMENT GROUP,ETOBICOKE,Very High price. there are mice in the house. One small room cost 1700 CAD. There is 10 rooms in house
1540,SHELLEY ENMAN,SCARBOROUGH,Very nice & friendly. Raised rent slightly above legal limit once after not raising rent for years. Did not pay out interest on last month's rent.
1541,ERIN TREMBLAY,SUDBURY,"Absolutely fantastic. She demonstrates pride of ownership, and is very fair, reasonable, approachable, and just generally lovely. Timely repairs, and proactive care and maintenance. I never had to worry, and always felt safe, secure, and comfortable."
1542,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"Terrible response rate, had no heat for one month because they kept sending a plumber who would turn the gas on (not allowed to touch this by the way only reliance is supposed to) which would then shut itself off due to a safety response as it was leaking gas. The plumber kept reporting problem fixed we have heat for a full month until they finally sent reliance out. We had a washer that was breaking bouncing around needed to be fixed or changed and since it still was running they wouldn’t do anything to fix it. Half the windows would not open and they did not send anyone to fix this as it isn’t an emergency. They would send notices that someone would be entering the house and no one would ever enter.. very inconvenient for someone who works shift work. We moved into a house with children scribbles all over the walls in the bedroom and living room and were told they would provide the paint but we had to repaint it …"
1543,OWNERS MANAGEMENT GROUP,ETOBICOKE,High price. there are mice in the house
1544,YING (MATT) CHEN,GUELPH,He is great at leaving you alone but his one flaw is he does not like putting money in to fix things that break around the house.
1545,JING GAO,SCARBOROUGH,I wish every landlord be like her .One of the wonderful landlord one can ever get.She is a gem.
1546,CPM PROPERTIES,SAULT STE. MARIE,"Horrible company all around, do zero maintenance and charge over the top rates for places that are near being condemned"
1547,GERRY HORST,WEST MONTROSE,"Enterd my unit to use the bathroom, when I was not home. Never fixed anything,  allowed heat to be 15 in the dead of winter. Made highly inappropriate comments. Never paid the money owed for the false N12. 
The list goes on!"
1548,"ATTA HAQ, NAZISH HAQ",KITCHENER,.
1549,1590733 ONTARIO INC,OTTAWA,"The property was very dirty when we got the keys. We spent a week cleaning it out. The landlord,Tony, threatened to evict us when he found out we had children (which we were very transparent about with his property manager). Due to construction happening near the dwelling, we soon discovered we had a rat infestation. When we called to request he send an exterminator, he threatened us with eviction again. 

The property is extremely poorly insulated. Two of the burners on the stove did not function properly and the oven didn’t function properly either. To say Tony is a slumlord is an understatement."
1550,J CHANDRAMOHAN,TORONTO,"Renovicted me 7 months into a high risk pregnancy, watched me put together a nursery and then pulled a renoviction scam. By the time I had found out he had  moved someone in less than a week after I moved out, the 1 year I had to fight it with the board was up. He was supposed to offer the apartment back to us following repairs, claimed he was selling the house but never did. He also asks for illegal security deposits."
1551,RITA AND LARRY FROM GRAND RIVER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"Horrible landlords. The property management is also horrible. They never answer your calls ever. They only returned my call when I  threatened to file harrassment charges on my spying landlords. At first I thought my landlords were ok. Minus them talking trash about people in my building. This all started when I was dating a guy and we broke up and I had given him keys to my apartment. He refused to give them back and for my safety as we didn't have a lock on the building at the time I called them to see of they could change the locks. They came over and gave me so much attitude about it. Saying I'm not allowed to give ANYONE a key. I live alone and have no family and have 2 pets. If something happens to me then someone will be getting a key(atm haven't given anyone a key though for the past 3 years since this happened as I have trust issues now) one day in April 2021 I was waiting in my lobby for my Uber eats.we have a lock on our lobby door so that no 1 can even get into the building. Larry the male landlord was in our building(3 story walk up) I'm waiting down on the first floor. I'm waiting about 5 minutes. During this time the whole time he waited outside in the hallway spying on and listening to me and my transaction(receiving the food) as I'm going up to my apartment on the second floor I finally hear him go inside the third floor area(the hallway is small and u can hear everything) when I got back I'm livid. So half an hour after this occurred I called them to tell them my disgust on them spying on me. I told them I don't appreciate it. My landlord rudely retorts that is what happens when u are a drug addict and drunk. I'm disabled(Take prescription meds so if u are looking through the garbage you are a creep) secondly I work in a Brewery. I get free alcohol. And I don't even take my meds if I drink. I don't take my recycling out every week I take it out when my large bin gets full. Last I checked though prescription meds aren't illegal and neither is drinking. Even if I did weed (I didn't then, I take CBD now with a bit of thc for pain) that was legal since 2015. I moved in 2016, and this happened in 2021. I was so angry I called the property management several times(3 total) and left 2 messages about this and the last 1 threatening to file a harrassment charge on them. Only then did she call me back. (Grand River Property management) She came to take down a statement from them first and a day later me. I know because I saw her the day before with them outside. Doubt anything got done. She never said anything back so I again called her repeatedly and asked on a voice-mail what was being done. I got crickets. No response. Left a message to call me back. Last time i called and left a message demanding to know what she was going to do about this. She tells me she told them not to talk to me and advised me not to either. Like I have to when things need to be repaired. We have a note we fill out and they bring in amateur people to fix things 90% of the time. 
To note our building was built in 1964. I needed that info to set up my Hydro. Which my landlords told me. So our buildings electricity is always going out. Mostly in the summer, the dryer in basement trips out all the time, and the kitchen outlet I've had problems with since I moved in. So I called the fire department because I feared for my safety and cats when I work 12 hour shifts(ya still working disabled) he asked me to ask how old the building was. So I called them to inquire. Because I wasn't sure if it was 1962 or 1964. So Larry answers the phone again and denies he knows the answer to this. They have been living here years mind u(people setting up Hydro need to know that information) he tells me he doesn't know. I tell him well u had to give me that information when I moved in to set up Hydro so u do know. He starts yelling at me I'm wrong and he doesn't know. At this point I've had it with this jerk. I yell back u do know, and who's on drugs now?! And hung up on him. Fire department comes over and talks to landlords. He sent me an email telling me he told them they need to fix any issues that are a fire hazard. So I write out this page of 5 issues with 5 separate issues with different electrical issues. My kitchen outlet, my power always tripping out, the dryer tripping out in basement and the lights in the hallways always out so it's dark(I work nights and come home in the dark and sometimes leave in the dark depending on time change) he sets up an appointment with an electrician and I've had it with him. I decide to video him while he and this guy are in my apartment. I tell the electrician about all the issues and the guy says I'm just here to fix the kitchen outlet. I say but there is all these other issues and he says u need to talk to him(Larry who was standing in the kitchen with him) and I said I would but the last time I talked to him I got yelled at. The electrician sees my phone and asks are u recording me? I say im recording him being in my apartment as is my right(my property and i consent as I'm in the video and narrarated a few parts of the interaction. He doesn't say anything else about it. During this time Larry doesn't say a peep. Trying to be nice as pie in front of this guy. If I was alone he would have said stuff I know him. As they walk put the hallway i can hear them talking trash about me recording and i hear Larry say ya shes like that. Lol. I wonder why. I have to know protect myself. In case i need to go to court for these jerks. I've been here just over 7 years. So late last year they started fixing up the building. They put on a new roof, touched up paint in our apartments, put in brand new mailboxes, fixed the lights the ones in the front and back that go out every 2 months(no joke, the electrical is bad) they finally got brighter ones. Come to find put a tenant made a complaint about it being dark which is not allowed by landlord and tenant laws. I figure at this time they are fixing to sell the place. So anyways talking to a neighbor he is suing them. They took out the lights in the garages a couple select people have(12 garages and landlords own 4 for whatever reason. There are 22 units in both buildings combined.)anyways this tenant had heart failure. He was on the ground and thankfully someone taking garbage out found him in the dark. He also has black mold in his apartment they refuse to fix and they took away his stove and refuse to replace it. So he is suing them for the mold and almost killing him from lack of light in his garage. No 1 would have seen him and he could have died. He spent 9 days in the hospital and got a larger heart monitor put in from this accident. They tried to kick him out for them getting a negligent plumber in that didn't seal the sink in his apartment so it ended up flooding the downstairs apartment and they tried to say he owed over $1000 for water damage and if he didn't pay they would kick him out. Eviction. They gave him an N5 or whatever paper. That was last year. Clearly they don't have proof it was his fault and haven't pursued the eviction letter they sent. (N5 I think, I seen the paper and read it today) probably why they want to sell. Most of us are long term tenants some 20+ years. And are paying below market rent and they are getting sued for thousands of $ from this guy. They were sued before from a girl who slipped and fell. Also on that note 2 people slipped and fell within 24 hours because our landlord refused to salt the entry way. His wife ended up in the hospital as did another tenant in the basement. This happened this year a few months ago. Maybe February or March. Both had an ambulance. They are the negligent 1's, won't replace stoves which is against the tenant rights they MUST replace them, won't fix electrical that has high probability to start fires(which they would probably try to blame on us. Sorry Larry I have proof. I took pictures of the letter and time stamps of when I asked to get these issues fixed and u stood there and said nothing while the electrician said he was only there for 1 reason only) accuse people of being on drugs and alcohol without knowing the truth, are rude, abusive, gossiping about other people and harassing. I kinda do hope we get new management, and hopefully new landlords. These ones are probably early 70 to late 70's and are bitter people. Grand River Property Management Inc. Is useless also. 
By far the worst landlords AND property management I have ever had, and I've had quite a few and some weren't great but nothing like these people."
1552,FIELDGATE PROPERTIES,NORTH YORK,Bad building maintenance. Common areas are dirty. Elevators constantly are broken.
1553,ALICE BOM,SUDBURY,"Does not understand Landlord-Tenant Act whatsoever. Was told many times about mold issues and refused to do anything about it other than giving tenants a quarter jug of bleach to clean it. The floor boards in the bathroom were literally rotten and moldy and we figured she'd want to fix that to avoid further damage but no, she didn't. Constantly came around without any notice. Shouldn't be a landlord."
1554,GINA THOMPSON/HAMILTON,OSHAWA,By far the worst LL I have personally witnessed. The list would go on and on. This LL has earned the title with ease of slum lord
1555,SIGNET 140 KINGSTON ROAD,TORONTO,Used to be a great building before it was sold to the new company. They are upgrading the building incredibly slowly with poor work. The super is covering two buildings and it's often dirty.
1556,CROSSBRIDGE,TORONTO,Absolutely do not cover any repairs.
1557,ACCOMOD8U,WATERLOO,"Accomod8u, a company that offers rentals for okay prices however there support effort is almost non existing and if you report more then a few things that need fixing they close off your matenance requests and they will also charge you for every one of them afterwards, aside from that they rip you off for hydro costs and they do not clean up your apartment before you move in aswell as slap you with termination notice dude to demolition order and afterwards ignore your lease ( demand a transfer fee ) of 500$ on top of 500 for key deposit ( won't move any money over from your current lease to accommodate your rent agreement won't hover your current least ) but will charge you first and last for a new apartment you will need due to them demoliting your current house of residence instead they want 1695$ twice on top of 500 $ for key deposit refused to move your last one over or give back it but instead demanded that we take a ""deal"" that would make it easier 100$off rent for 1 year and due to the deal we now need to pay to transfer our lease .... hell no do not rent from them"
1558,CAM AND MICHELLE MCDONALD,BRANTFORD,"Good landlord's overall
Do wish they would do some updating of the property"
1559,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,I've lived here for 15 years.  Older building but very well maintained and very clean.  The one time I discovered a couple bugs in my kitchen the problem was tackled aggressively.  Within 3 weeks the problem was solved.  Haven't seen another one in many years. It's great
1560,CAPRIET,TORONTO,"I absolutely love the building I live in because of the people and location, however Capreit is not a great landlord. The lack of communication with tenants is terrible. Repairs take a long time, and when they are completed (by the cheapest contractors they can find) they aren't done properly. Often things need to be repaired again. There has been a lot of problems with maintaining staff in the office so they keep on having to redo things like locker or parking spot inventory because the person who did it before didn't keep it in a place where the next person can see it. It's not the end of the world, but it certainly cause inconvenience to tenants who have to keep filling out forms over and over.  There has also been a lack of common sense and competency when it comes to knowledge about repairs and the order in which things need to happen. They are consistently doing unnecessary cosmetic renovations like changing the furniture in the lobby or the office, or painting the walls, or updating the lights in the pool, but don't do the things that are really necessary like repairing a sauna that hasn't worked properly in decades, or reducing potential for mould by clearing water out of storage areas every time it rains, or fixing issues in tenants units in a timely manner. They also are as often as possible doing above guideline increases, and will fight property tax rent decreases from the city every single time. I mean from a business perspective it makes sense for them, but from a human rights perspective it's terrible! This February they reported a record 24.3 per cent average rent increase on turnover (increasing rent for the next tenant, after the previous individual moves out.) So if they take a really long time to do mediocre at best repairs, of course tenants are going to want to move out, which then allows them to increase the rent, and by making things look pretty cosmetically they can ask for higher and higher rent for new people coming in.  All that being said, I do acknowledge it could be a lot worse, as I've seen in other places, but it could also be a lot better! I wish Capreit would remember that their actions or inactions affect the life, physical health, and mental health of their customers, and would treat us, and encourage their staff to treat us with respect and dignity. Thank goodness for tenants who fight to get needed changes and repairs to happen!"
1561,BRIAN NOOREN,ST THOMAS,Dirt floor crawl space with intense black mold issues that made me so physically ill I missed work and ended up moving out over it. When confronted with the issue they came in while I was sleeping from a night shift and without blocking off the air ducts to my apt or turning off the furnace and removed the mold covered plastic from the crawl space making black mold spores even more so airborne thru the furnace duct work and Into my apartment while I was sleeping.  When the other tenants raised concerns he told them I didn’t wash my walls frequently enough. Lol the place was deplorable when I moved in and the only reason anything was ever clean or repaired was because I did all the maintenance.  He has so many properties he can not keep up with the maintenance and the drive way is never plowed in time to get to work.  He put my health at risk to hide the giant mold problem in the crawl space even went so far as to put a lock on the door to the crawl space so I couldn’t show anyone. Was one of the cheapest rentals when I lived there and got poisoned by black mold to the tune of $550 a month now he’s charging more than double that for people to move in and breathe black mold spores
1562,ROCK SOLID PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SUDBURY,We rent from Rock Solid Property after our building was sold. Getting in touch with someone at the office is a nightmare. We have neighbours that use drugs and are in and out at all hours. The police and rescue are here all the time and although they have been behind on their rent and we've been told they are getting evicted nothing has been done to get them out.
1563,WELCOME HOME RENTALS,LONDON,"Irwin was a fantastic landlord for our building. He quoted me a price for the rental initially and when he realized it was incorrect, he said that he would honour it. His maintenance crew was quick and willing to come even on a public holiday. The building was older but was well managed. Communication could have been more timely but it never caused significant delays if something needed to be addressed."
1564,GLENN FERNANDES (4RENT ORILLIA),ORILLIA,"Glenn seemed friendly and experienced when we first signed the contract.  He mainly does student rentals.  He strikes me as a nickel and dime type of guy, having a coin laundry machine in the unit that barely works, not replacing the light bulb in the stairwell to the basement unit, having blinds for the room that are too small... he even tried to get us to pay a $50 fee for a twin mattress cover which costs at most $15 on Amazon... Also, for a guy who threatens to charge his tenants a cleaning fee if the house is not clean to his standards, there was a layer of dust on the furniture in my room when I moved in, I could not walk barefoot in the house the first day without getting my feet dirty, and the kitchen cupboards were not clean either.  He was also disrespectful toward my housemate, who was an international student from India, speaking to her with a rude tone and not following up on his word to provide furnishings for her room (he kept his word to myself and our other housemate-- both of us had parents involved in the rental process whereas she didn't).  

There are better landlords with nicer accommodations in the area. I would advise anyone who rents with him to not let him take advantage of you!"
1565,HOUSING CAMBRIDGE,CAMBRIDGE,"They do not take care of their properties. They allow tenants to vandalize and destroy common living areas. Tenants are not made to clean up their outside space. 
Garbage, broken glass and dog poop is everywhere.
We were told for 6 years that we would get new windows. No one ever answers their phones. They half ass repair everything and nothing is completed properly."
1566,MINTO,TORONTO,"I really enjoyed my time at The ROE, the super was always seen around the building keeping it well-maintained. My fridge broke and it was replaced within 2 hours of me sending in the service request so I didn't have to throw out any food. When my lease was up in my one bedroom suite, I upgraded into a two bed renovated suite and loved it!"
1567,DAVID SMALLBONE,OAKVILLE,The landlord special of all landlords.
1568,NATHAN REID HOLDINGS,GUELPH,"I really enjoy my apartment! The landlord is great, never had any issues! Really recommend!"
1569,ABC,MISSISSAUGA,It been great but not so much.
1570,GREY BRUCE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,PORT ELGIN,"This is one of the largest landlords in the whole region and so if you don’t accept their poor maintenance and high rent rates, you’re unlikely to find anywhere else to live. Grey Bruce Property Management and it’s many related companies under owner Barry Kruisselbrink do the bare minimum and get away with it. We had mold for a year and a half and they do nothing."
1571,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS,OTTAWA,The property looks like the slums. Drug dealers everywhere. Constant police coming for problems. They don’t vet their tenants. Don’t enforce the safe and secure part of the lease. Garbage shute always blocked. Have no idea who the superintendent is. Carpets not changed in over 18 years. No painting in units until tenants move. Maintenance done in common areas but not apartments. Dog urine in the landings.
1572,FRANCE LAMONTAGNE,OTTAWA,This landlord and her husband uses intimidation as a way to bully their tenants. Charged an illegal damage deposit and then refused to give it back as stated crumbs were left in drawers and water drops left on walls. Left garbage outside of condo for 6 months and finally had to move it as rats were beginning to gather and neighbours weee complaining.  122A Lindenshade drive
1573,TERESA FOLEY,OTTAWA,"Landlord engages in bad practises -she should not be renting in her condo property and continues to do so. Also expects tenants to cook, clean, and so everything for her. Stay far far away!"
1574,PARK PROPERT MANAGEMENT INC,TORONTO,"Overall a decent company. However since the pandemic and WTH models they've become very apathetic to people's lives.

Constant turnover and construction in the building with very little notice given."
1575,FIRST NORTH PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH BAY,They don't fix anything vacuum for common areas broken for months and care taker told just to sweep the mess.  It's carpet mess won't go away.  There was no heat in the building all winter and residents had to buy portable heaters.  Caretaker reported the heating problem to property management and they did nothing.
1576,MIKE ASHIE,BARRIE,"I am so happy to have Mike as a landlord. He’s been absolutely wonderful. Anytime I’ve had a concern or in need of a repair, he’s been down within 24hr. Easy to get a hold of, maintains the property. Will reach out well in advance to let you know if he’s stopping by to do maintenance like change air filters."
1577,ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT INC.,ST. CATHARINES,"My father occupied a 2 bedroom apartment for 6 years.  He was the sole occupant after his wife died and any time a repair was needed, a work order was filed and when the repair was done it was not done by a professional contractor.  
His car was crushed by a tree in the parking lot because it wasn't maintained and he was offered no help.  They didn't even check on him.
They were told the pool was being removed from day 1 (it is still a bug infested emptyish pool).  The parking lot was to be redone, again they were told this when they moved in.  My father had a number of falls there and the parking lot is just worse.  When he was moving, the front entry was blocked off for repairs and it is still blocked - how will an emergency vehicle ever get to the building - shameful.  
Shortly before my father moved out, the ceiling above him was leaking.  The property manager made the super wake up my father to get permission to view - I was present and his POA at the time.  They are horrible to deal with.
Moved out end of Nov 2022 and we are still waiting for the key and laundry card deposit."
1578,GREENROCK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"I lived in various Greenrock properties for 5 years, and had a positive experience. Despite relatively high rent costs (perhaps just a larger city-wide issue), I found Greenrock to be responsive, helpful, and communicative whenever I needed assistance. When I needed to move to a smaller apartment at short notice, Greenrock were very accommodating."
1579,MARIA CALPITO,LONDON,Greedy landlord. Showing up without proper notice.
1580,NOVI PROPERTIES,NORTH YORK,"I have been a longtime tenant in a NOVI Properties building in North York and it has been a very good renting experience. The building superintendents are kind and reliable, and repairs are always done in a timely manner. My privacy is respected and I have only seen patrons treated with respect."
1581,OLD OAK,LONDON,"Horrible company to rent from
Don’t feel safe in our own building- outside doors don’t lock
Our building is in Hyde park- may as well be EOA
staff not friendly
Parking is ridiculous 
No safety plans in place for people that go to gym- in basement. No telephone service in case of emergency
Repairs— done when they want and come to door with no warning
Wouldn’t reckons to anyome"
1582,JOAN DERR -THE MARQ- CENTURION PROPERTIES,LONDON,"Joan, joan, joan... where do I start with you? You're condescending, rude and straight up LIE to peoples faces. I lived in the Marq at 205 Oxford Street for a couple of years and I enjoyed my unit.
 Joan is a whole different story. She plays dumb, challenges you on everything. All I can say is, the actual units are nice, they're decently well taken care of. But Joan needs to be GONE. Its a shame that despite the number of complaints Centurion has received about her, she's still there. Just know your rental rights before moving in through her."
1583,EVALYN MACPHADEN,ORILLIA,"Lacks respect, integrity, running a home that is extremely toxic. Discriminatory."
1584,METCAP,TORONTO,"The locks on the doors have been broke for over a year. Homeless meth addicts sleep, piss and shit in the stairwells which never gets cleaned. They light fires weekly inside the stairwells, lobby and parking lot.  They break into apartments constantly. People have been stabbed in the back parking lot. Management doesn’t care. There’s no heat for the building during winter (city of Toronto fined them!). There’s dog shit everywhere. Homeless steal your Amazon packages at your door step. They don’t sweep or mop the common space, ever. There was a meth dealer that lived here. After they kicked him out he moved in with the former building care taker (who’s a meth addict). Now people go and sleep in that unit because the doors aren’t locked on the unit. It’s the most dangerous place I have ever seen. I’m scared I will be murdered at my door step, inside the building."
1585,ALLIANCE MANAGEMENT INC,ST. CATHARINES,The building is a disaster. Parking is an extra $30 a month and is almost as dangerous to walk through let alone drive your car through. There are numerous pot holes and sink holes. Often the floors in common areas have spills that are not wiped up and the carpets in all hallways are disgusting. Add to all this the main/front entrance has been closed for repairs since October but there has not been anyone working on it for MONTHS. Delivers are made to the back door where there is no where for the packages to sit for people to come home and pick up in the middle of the main floor causing a tripping hazard or issues of leaving in an emergency.
1586,ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OSHAWA,"So while this company is the middle man for renters and landlord, they do not know what landlords are responsible for. I’ve rented from them. While they seemed to be a great company showing the place , I quickly learned they expect 700 upfront , 98 a person to apply( when seeing the unit it was said that apply will cost nothing), than if you change your mind at all they will NOT give you back your money in full as they believe the are entitled to 200 from it. When called about repairs or behaviours that their clients showing up unannounced . They will only do what the landlord say etc etc so they will say no to repairs unless you plan on paying them for it. Again they expect the tenants to do yard maintenance and snow as well. And when told the laws, they don’t listen. Being locked out of a unit they will NOT help. And if the landlord owes you any money for paying the bills let’s say 50/50 spilt with another tenant, the refused to pay for it ."
1587,CHRISTOPHER BEDARD 901-370 DIXON RD,MISSISSAUGA,"Upon arrival to unit the main and only bathroom had a huge hole in the shower wall, this hole connected to another hole in the adjacent bedroom closet. The kitchen sink did not work, and the kitchen was unusable due to lack of cleaning and hoarding like clutter through the condo. There was mold surrounding the windows and the condo smelled heavily of smoke. 

He evicted because of a cat allergy, an allergy that he had no symptoms for, for over a year and decided all of a sudden he couldn’t handle it because he kept getting sick and not taking care of himself. (This landlord lives in the unit).

He in multiple occasions would enter his tenants rooms to take items or poke around and vehemently denied it even after being caught with theft.

On multiple occasions he threatened to kill his tenants while on drug fuelled rants. 

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS MAN!"
1588,MOHAMMED,MARKHAM,.
1589,"HINES, URIEL OR IRENE",THUNDER BAY,"Landlord dragged their feet when it came to repairs, sometimes taking months and most often they elected to use the cheapest, minimal method of repair. Rodent control was nonexistent, the property had a rat problem. I incurred all the expenses and used my time and patience to deal with the problem. The landlord was aware of the problem and called nobody or did anything to deal with the problem. The landlord did not respect our privacy, he routinely arrived unannounced on the property. They applied pressure tactics and threats of eviction in an effort to raise the rent beyond the provincial rate. Same applied to efforts to pass on utility costs that were covered in the rental agreement, they no longer wanted to pay them and attempted to download the extra costs onto the tenant without following the applicable law on the matter. The landlord used false N13 eviction claims to remove multiple tenants from their rental properties so they could increase the rent of the properties. They never followed the legal process, never actually filing N13 documents with the authorities , rather they just presented the documents to the tenants and proceeded to pressure them into leaving."
1590,SILVER MANAGEMENT JASMINE BUILDINGS,OTTAWA,"Property management is awful, the units in these buildings are over priced, infested with cockroaches, constant issues with filthy laundry rooms, sketchy maintenance workers, terribly insulated, bad repairs, mold damage…the list goes on and on.."
1591,WHITEHALL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CORUNNA,1*
1592,NORTH EDGE PROPERTIES NEPM,ETOBICOKE,"Gave 1 star because there is no 0 rating available. Huge cockraches problem, lack of efficiency in maintainance problem, no one available to contact in office or head office. Huge parking issue and management dont care about it. It like winning lottery if you can get in touch with management. Security team is their way of communication who are unaware of most problem and its not their job to look after unit maintanance. They flush people out after few years. Stay away from NEPM properties. They have few in and around toronto"
1593,GREENWIN,HAMILTON,"Terrible landlords. Cockroaches, bed bugs, rats and nothing done. 

Leaks from above me, and they cut a hole in my bathroom wall and never returned to repair it. I had to put another work order in for them to return and fix the hole they made. 

During covid they would not accept debit payments, so I had to go to the bank to get a preauthorized form, which is against the RTA. 

Water was turned off for DAYS and I had to carry cases of water to the 18th floor since the elevators were not working either. 

They eventually sold the building to Valery who proceeded to renovict tenants to be able to make condos to sell, but who would buy a cockroach and bed bug infested condo???"
1594,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"Extremely dishonest management company that will try and coerce, harass and evict tenant by driving a wedge between landlord and tenant to raise rents. Absolutely appalling business practices over at KW Property Management."
1595,MAPLEWOOD MORGUARD,MISSISSAUGA,Do NOT rent here.  Huge disgusting cock roach problem here .  They are the size of toonies and the office staff do nothing to get rid of them..  all she said was every building has them.. not true lady.. even so the units should all be sprayed but they wont because they are too cheap
1596,CHUCK & ELLEN -DREWLO,LONDON,"This husband and wife team are great. They're friendly, courteous and keep to their word. If there's an issue, I wouldn't hesitate to call them because I know they'll get it figured out. 
They also take no BS from people which I really respect."
1597,BEN BETHUNE,NORTH BAY,"Ben is on the ball. Nice lad, not much to say. Very handy, and quick to repair issues. He is working on renovating units in the building. Recycles."
1598,HORST MROWKA,WATERLOO,"I've never seen the property owner, Horst, at the property, his son, Andre, lives in and runs the building. 
Since moving in I have been missing outlet covers, a thermostat, several baseboards and the screens for the windows. The bathroom needs a second coat of paint and the kitchen cabinets are primed but un-painted. All of these things were supposed to be done before I moved in, none have been completed. The door to my apartment is also damaged and in need of replacement, but after 2 years of waiting nothing has happened. the parking lot is also in dire need of repair.
Andre is a nice enough person, but he doesn't really do anything, and you have to remind him constantly or nothing ever gets done. Contacting Horst directly doesn't seem to be worth while, I have never gotten a response. 
The building goes through the required safety checks, such as fire alarm tests, etc. And most major issues like plumbing, or heating are fixed in a timely manner. 
The building could use a thorough washing and a bit of work could make it look newer and nicer."
1599,COMPTEN MANAGEMENT,NORTH YORK,"I would caution anyone from renting a property that they manage. They are bullies, they harass tenants, make them pay for repairs, are dishonest and much more. They have fly infestations, no respect for long time tenants that are old and sick, forcing them to move. No regard for disability access requirements, they live by their own rules , feel the are above the law on every issue.
Never witnessed so much suffering inflicted on people who pay to have a roof over their head!! So sad!!"
1600,VICTORIA PARK COMMUNITY HOUSING,KITCHENER,They do not look after their tenants they do not pay attention to work orders. I still have mold and I sent a work order in a while ago. I still have holes in my shower where they were supposed to be repaired. I’m still waiting for a few things yet.
1601,ROSE AND PINO ALBANESE,HAMILTON,"Rose and Pino have little to no understanding of the Ontario Residential Tenancy Act nor Municipal Property Standards, this has resulted in unsafe living conditions for tenants. It is documented within the municipality of Hamilton that Rose and Pino Albanese have neglected to address blocked fire exits, internal fire hazards, leaks and mold overgrowth. Rose and Pinot Albanese have accumulated several City of Hamilton Property Standards fines. Additionally it is documented with the municipality of Hamilton that they have physically approached a tenant threatening eviction if an above guideline rental increase is not accepted. 

Neglecting tenants and bylaw repair requests, unlawful intimidation and jeopardizing the safety their tenant, lands them the lowest possible score of 5/25"
1602,MORGENSTERN,HAMILTON,Morty was a wonderful landlord.
1603,BRADWICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH BAY,"Especially in terms of repairs, I always had issues. When we moved in, we had to point out the pieces of the apartment that were broken in order to not be charged. When we moved out we asked for months for a front door that would close. When they finally fixed our front door, they told us that they would be back to painted the next day that never happened. Within a few weeks of moving in the mirror in one of the bathroom, Stella off the wall we cleaned up all the glass and two weeks later we got a mirror that’s a different size so you can see all the holes from the old mirror. When all the snow melted, the roof began leaking and water poured out of our light fixture onto our bed. Someone was sent in with a bucket, some plastic to cover our bed, and we were told not to turn on the light as a solution."
1604,GOLDEN EQUITY PROPERTIES,TORONTO,The worst apparent and landlord ever. The city should see how tenants are dealing with our struggles which we shouldn’t be because we are paying our rent. Superintendent never attended any request for repairs or even just cleaning the garbage they even closed all indoor parking lot without giving the tenants an alternative parking spot so everyone is trying to find a spot for parking. The building stinks and the wall paint are falling apart inside the unit and outside the building to say the least
1605,PETER HARRISON (PROPERTIES BY JP LTD),PETERBOROUGH,"Property Manager, Pete Harrison for Properties by JP LTD is great. Responsive and accommodating. The building is very old, but the unit is still quite nice despite being well over 100 years old. Recently added new windows to help reduce cost of utilities. He let us paint the unit and even paid for and provided us with the paint and supplies to use! We discovered an issue with fleas just as we were going to be moving in, and he had the place treated twice which seemed to resolve the issue. Helped me shovel my car out on a very snowy day so that I could get to work on time. Had a great experience at that apartment and dealing with Pete the property manager."
1606,JUDY MCARTHUR,ORO MEDONTE,No regard for others well-being
1607,SCHICKEDANZ BROS PROPERTIES,NORTH YORK,"I've lived at Bayview and Cummer for 15 years. The buildings in this group (owned by Schickedanz) are the best. Clean, safe, respectful, with a happy environment and great staff."
1608,OLD OAK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"The buildings of the Old Oak Forest Hill area have been undergoing consistent decoration since November 2020. If you happen to move in, you will likely experience excessive noise. In 2020 and 2021, the noise levels in my unit could reach up to 90dB at 8:30 AM.  It's important to note that both the managers and decoration teams have master keys to the units, and they may enter with insufficient notice (only the date is informed, not the specific time). They will only knock once or twice, and if you happen to be in the bathroom or elsewhere and miss the knock, they may break in. One morning at 8 am, I was awoken by a knock on my door. I do not know who it was, and I was not dressed. The building manager had already opened the door and said some emergency leaking happened from nowhere, and he needs to check my unit. This was an extremely unpleasant experience. P.S. The so-called emergency was fixed after two fuc*** months."
1609,ALBA MANCUSO,TRENTON,"This woman is a money hungry and horrible human.  She is a bully, rude and cannot be trusted at all.  She has very shady ""staff"" and she lies very badly.  Horrible landlord.  She is neglectful, mean and does not take care of her many properties."
1610,M.A RANA ( RED PINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),HAMILTON,If I could rate all of these zero I would.
1611,CEHUNT DUONG,TORONTO,"Cehunt was a great and hands-off landlord. Available when we needed him but otherwise left us be. Friendly and respectful, would rent from him again if I had the opportunity."
1612,BRIAN RIPLEY,STRATHROY,Brian is an awesome land lord. I stayed in his house for 1.5 years with no issues with him. Any repairs or issues brought to him would get resolved right away.
1613,TIM & JENNIFER CROWE,GUELPH,Truly the most amazing landlords I have ever had. They were prompt in repairs and replacing anything that needed to be done. They felt more like family than landlords! We lucked out for sure!
1614,SID DEVELOPMENT/RWC,SAULT STE. MARIE,"Biggest slumlords in Ontario. Buys up all the houses in northern Ontario to rent out at high prices. Don’t fix any problems with there units. Puts a bandaid on it. Gives you the all okay to fix issues then refused to pay you back your money. Multiple complaints from other tenants. No hot water for 22 days . Unit dirty before moving . Changed landlords multiple times in 9 months. Also change company name, and failed to tell half of there tenants. Give fake notice to entry to don’t show up. Also gives your personal information to Dixon collections whi calls you multiple times a day and is rude. But once a hearing date is set no more calls from Dixon ."
1615,"ROBERT ""RABIE"" MARRAKSHI",HAMILTON,"Robert ""Rabie"" Marrakshi is an irresponsible, immoral greed filled human being. Not only is he crude and a manipulative, he's also a coward. Regarding property management ""Rob"" as he sometimes referred has operational standards as follows: lowest inputs possible, lowest possible effort, lowest ethical standing, maximum return. Proceed with extreme caution with business and specifically tenancy."
1616,MY RENTAL UNIT,BRANTFORD / SIMCOE,"Dealing with Glenn and Pamela is nothing short of a nightmare. You have to continually hound them to get repairs done. They are full of excuses, avoiding issues, and unbelievably rude."
1617,LIDA NOORAFKAN- REMAX,ETOBICOKE,This lady is so rude and flakey. I rented for a summer sublet and the tenants who were living there left all their stuff in the apartment. They let me know that they would be back at the end of the summer to collect their stuff which was fine. Near the end of the summer the tenants told me that they would not be returning so Lida told me that I would be responsible to clean up and clear out all the belonging of the other tenants. I told her that it is not my job to clean up other peoples mess which she didnt seem to understand. One morning the owners of the house came into my apartment with zero notice and told me that I have to clean up the apartment. So unprofessional. The dryer also stopped working after a week or so of moving in. It was never fixed so I had to go to the laundromat. After moving out I emailed Lida to get a rent receipt for my taxes and she totally ghosted me. If you want a good experiance in a landlord please go far far away from Lida at REMAX
1618,RYERS MANAGEMENT (VARI HOLDINGS),TORONTO,"Awful management by family member- the heir to the fortune that awaits.
We have to call 311 and open up a case with the city for them to do anything."
1619,JENNIFER C,INNISFIL,"He / They / She, It's an Asian couple, not sure who holds the physical property or if it's both of them, don't or didn't understand a tenant rights.  The property was located at 1680 Emberton Way, Innisfil Ontario, L9S 0N4. 

They made a giant fuss about a medical cannabis grow in the basement, which had a fully isolated environment.   These are legal under the ACMPR, providing the person it's designated for is also tending the garden.  They tried to argue using an outdated 1996 law, that doesn't apply and is fully superseded by the ACMPR.  This led to try to evict my family, and the stress and headache inducing nature of the ordeal caused me to move the garden.

They accused us of modifying the electrical panel, and making ""unsafe"" modifications to the house, neither of which we did. 

They gave us a large rent increase of ~14%, moving the rent from 2100 / month to 2400 / month.  After raising the rent they rapidly tried to perform a bad eviction on us, and refused to offer up any evidence of their endgame, which caused legal problems, resulting in us being unable to move.

When we were finally able to move, they wanted us to paint the walls, replace the carpet, replace counter tops, they essentially wanted a full house renovation.  

One time I was unable to be home well they wanted to ""inspect"" the property, my partner was there, they belittled and degraded her the entire time.

They refused to put any money into the house, so any minor interaction with most of the interior left smudging, staining, and marks. 

Would I rent from them again?  No!

On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a total abusive landlord, 10 being A+ star landlord, they were a 7, could have been much better and professional, but weren't terrible."
1620,SULINDER GILL,TORONTO,"We need awards for worst landlord in the city, and I’m sure this one would find its way on the list!  Had to move out due to lack of care/respect for her own property!  Be aware!"
1621,2596318 ON INC.,WAWA,"James Richard and Danny Mercer were excellent to rent from. Clean, well maintained units for a reasonable price. Super responsive, despite having busy lives, always gave us an alternate contact if they were going to be unreachable due to work. Both are really friendly, interesting guys. Cool with pets. 10/10"
1622,GOLDEN EQUITY PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"The worst landlord ever, very disrespectful for the tenants and never attended any tenants request .The building is falling apart due to lack of maintenance."
1623,MARYAM BANIASADI,EAST GWILLIMBURY,"Maryam has been a fair landlord. She’s not one to bother you, and respects the guidelines. When time came to renew, she asked only for a minimal increase of $50. I did not encounter many repairs but when I did, she was quick to respond and take care of things promptly. We had an issue with the smoke detectors and she supplied replacements the following day. I had to end tenancy early due to personal conflicts and she was very understanding and worked with me for an easy transition. The only gripe I have is that she did not inspect the property prior to us moving in, following the previous tenant, which left us with a LOT of cleaning and disposing of items left behind. Overall, not a bad landlord."
1624,MIKE VALIQUETTE,SUDBURY,"I’ve been here for 4 years now, and don’t plan on leaving until we can buy a home. Mike is great, rent is the most affordable I’ve heard of in our city anywhere, and very quick to address concerns. 
Great guy
(No, I’m not Mike lol)"
1625,PETER AND MICHELL ATKINSON,OTTAWA,Best lanlords I have ever had
1626,PROPERTY ONE,SAULT STE. MARIE,"The honest to God worst, I sent them multiple emails (to leave a trail) because of a mold issue, and all I got was ""we'll send someone to look) and then wouldn't hear a thing.  Windows were leaking, as well as the basement would constantly flood in the spring, and they said ""Yeah it needs to be dug up and sealed, but we won't be doing that"". Be very careful with Property One."
1627,DOUG WESTOVER,ETOBICOKE,"Doug was rude the entire time I rented from him. He is a very short tempered man who only cares about the rent money. The apartment was run down, cupboards were falling apart, and the upstairs tenant, who Doug knew, complained that we were smoking inside, which we never did. Doug should really have a reality check and maybe make better life choices so his tenants don't feel like another number in his books. 10/10 don't recommend having Doug as your landlord. Theres way better options out there."
1628,THEOCHARIES BROTHERS,LONDON,Slums
1629,CAMSTA NO1 LTD …. SUBSIDIARY OF DMS,HAMILTON,Dms is the worst landholdings in all of Canada ….. they fix nothing …. Except exterior and the  hike up the rents ….. we have no water sometimes 3 times a week ….. roaches …. Mice … rats and bedbugs adorn the apartments …… fires on a monthly basis ….. crackheads in the hallways …..
1630,WHITEHALL APARTMENTS,PICTON,"They don’t take care of maintenance requests in a timely manner. When they do get to it, it’s not generally done properly so they have to come back when they have time.. also no respect for tenants legitimate complaints such as; neighbours disturbing the peace. Cannot complain about loud noises or music it’s not a problem until after 11 when you can then get the police involved rather than get their help. Other neighbours using their BBQ on their attached balcony’s inwhich is a fire hazard. Suspected mold in the walls.Super old windows and doors . I could go on and on it’s not a great place to live."
1631,JASWANT TOOR,ETOBICOKE,Takes months and months to get anything fixed.  Excuses after excuses.  Buildings fall in disrepair.  Cheap shortcuts with repairs completed by amateurs to save a buck.
1632,JM PROPERTIES,KITCHENER,Very rude and never came to help fix properties
1633,ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BURLINGTON,Been tenant for a couple years and they are the best landlords I have eveer had.  Very quick to respond to any questions or repairs. Highly recommended.
1634,DASILVA,ETOBICOKE,"Landlord  does not respect privacy
Does not maintain property  .wanders around property all the time 7 days a week whenever he want. Our rent is never late and pay 2600 for a 2 brm .pretty pathetic isn't  it.When your Landlord  watches every move you make.brings his dog over craps everywhere doesn't clean up.
Had to get city inspector  to come out numerous  times to get things done.
Took him 9 months to replace washer .Doesn't respond to any issues.Turns of heat in the winter.
Not allowed to open a window for fresh air or let put cooking smell
Wish I could move but the rents are very high.All on all pathetic scumlord."
1635,FOUNDRY GEORGIAN,BARRIE,"The absolute worst company to rent from. They charge insane amounts for rent then have the audacity to charge people $90 to park in lot that doesnt even guarentee parking. They also make you prepay for 6 months of parking up front. This is supposed to be student housing too but they let old lady drug dealers live in nasty apartment filled with garbage. The people who work in the office are also rude and very flakey. They rarely give any sh*ts about people who park illegally or noise complaints. It feels like a bunch of losers who peaked in high school are running the company. The head office is also in the states so if you have a complaint that you want to be brought forward good luck finding anyone in charge to help you. If you have an issue you have to talk to the manager and she says ""oh i will contact them for you"" which the dumbest thing ive ever heard of. They seriously need a new group of competient people working there."
1636,WAYNE AND LINDA WATT,SOUTH PORCUPINE,"Initially thought they were personable and friendly when I first met them. As our tenancy went on, they evolved to become very intrusive and abrasive. We kept them informed about any issues that arose, as there were a few that would adversely impact their property value/cost a lot of money in the long run if left without intervention. They were quite hostile to us informing them about issues and acted like they were doing us a favour by fixing it. They lived around the corner, so repairs were pretty quick, though fixes were often “half-assed” and ineffective. They did seem to care about safety, as they did conduct a number of inspections throughout our year long lease, though they abuse the 24hr inspection rules and conducted numerous inspections over a 4 month span, that definitely could have been completed in  1 or 2 visits. The inspections felt intrusive rather than practical, couldn’t help but feel like they were trying to catch us doing something that they could berate us for. Smoke detectors all worked, we purchased our own carbon monoxide alarm because the ones they provided were ceiling mounted. We observed that they drove past the house frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, and our neighbours informed us that they saw them trying to peek into our windows on numerous occasions. The next door neighbour informed us that the wife was bragging to him about entering the unit without our knowledge or consent. We had hoped to live there long term, as it was a nice and spacious apartment listed for a reasonable price. Unfortunately living there was not worth the reasonable rental prices as the landlords were intrusive, disrespectful and abrasive. There were a few uncomfortable situations, but there was one in particular where the landlords screamed at me in the front yard for all the neighbours to hear when I responded to their question with an answer they were unhappy with, it was embarrassing and made me cry. I no longer felt safe in the dwelling and we moved out as soon as our one year lease was up. After we had moved out, we learned that some of the neighbours had taken bets on how long we “the new couple”  would last in the apartment, because the units have a history of being a revolving door of short tenancies due to the disrespectful and unreasonable nature of the landlords. I wish I had known that before signing the lease! Ultimately it is a nice and spacious apartment in a decent location for a below market price, the unit was clean and there were no issues with mold or pests (aside from the landlords themselves). So maybe if you can handle being spied on, and don’t mind intrusive, disrespectful landlords, it might be the place for you!"
1637,DIOGO REIS,ETOBICOKE,My landlord and his family are fantastic.
1638,AKELIUS,TORONTO,I have had only very good dealings with the management teams (that have come and gone with this company) .
1639,MARK STAPLETON JM PROPERTIES,WATERLOO,"Just completely disrespectful, makes the tenants seem incompetent, makes young girls shovel their own driveways, scares tenants into doing his dirty work, the list goes on and on"
1640,HARTZEL RD RENTALS INC,ST. CATHARINES,Don’t put garbage to the curb for months on end and expects the tenants to go through garbage to find theirs. Backups all the time. Lack of hot water. Mushrooms growing in bathrooms. Leaky sinks resulting in moldy cupboards. Broken appliances and give a hard time about replacing them. Spotty snow removal and salting in winter months. Rats as a result of no garbage to the curb. No security on a ‘secure door’ you need to pay to have a key for. Common areas often unkept and dirty.
1641,MATTHEW VARGHEESE,SMITHS FALLS,"Only lists rentals as to highest offer, he believes that you cannot put a value on housing but mind you only accepts top dollar offer. When it comes to maintenance he won’t do it, he will send out his “friend” Allan to for major issues but otherwise leaves things with “band aid repairs”. On a weirder note, Mr. Vargheese will text you at very random points of the month , at one point he reached out to my husband asking if when his father passes if we would move our roommate in with him? 

Overall be weary."
1642,COGIR,NORTH YORK,"Horrible landlord. They hire supers that do not do anything, buildings are always dirty and property management does not care about their tenants."
1643,LÉPINE,"OTTAWA, VANIER",They make money but......Respect????
1644,GWLRA,TORONTO,"GWLRA is a terrible landlord. For 2 Winters we barely had sufficient heating, and for weeks the water flow was very low and fluctuated so much one could not rinse at the shower. My suite has tiles cracking and falling off the walls, and some walls in my bedroom and closet are crumbling down. They made a lot of makeovers in the lobby, halls, and even out TVs in the elevators. They also added a heated pool and a gym to be able to raise prices much higher than what is allowed. Meanwhile, tenants (especially ones that are here for many years) have to endure horrible living conditions, unresponsiveness to fix problems, no security with a lot of suite and car break ins (underground parking garage at $120/month) delivery packages being regularly robed and even a homeless man that became a regular in our building soiling in our staircases and halls (using drugs and and stealing too!). We call security and they never even pick up!!! Run from any rental from GWLRA!"
1645,MARGARET LACH,HAMILTON,Worst landlord I've ever experienced. Tried to bully us out and increase the rent by 40%.
1646,DOMENIC RICCI,BARRIE,Mice & mold
1647,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,"I have been living in this building for over a year and while some things, like windows and elevators need to be modernized, over all communication has always been respectful and maintenance extra fast, especially on urgent matters."
1648,1463239 ONTARIO LTD,TORONTO,"The landlord's son is the 'maintenance' person and he targets women with his anger issues. He comes across as pleasant and respectful but if you are a woman beware he may turn on you for no reason and if he does you're on his hit list forever.  I heard stories about him from other women in the building but shrugged it off because he was always very nice and respectful to me.  He fixed things when needed, we always said hi when we ran into each other and had conversations until one day he decided he no longer liked me.  We had multiple issues that needed addressing but I couldn't have him in my apartment because I didn't feel safe, He is around 6'2"" and 250 - 300 lbs. and likes to use his size to intimidate women."
1649,EFFORT TRUST - LONGWOOD APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"Effort Trust has raised rents for their units over the course of the pandemic, so getting a new unit will cost you.  They will also raise your rent (within the bounds of the law) yearly.  They definitely overcharge based on how hot the market is.  
In the context of Longwood Apartments, the new superintendent is trying to catch up with years of disrepair in this building, so repair can often be slow or left incomplete.  However, the new superintendent keeps the building very clean and is very responsive to questions.  There are no issues with bugs or rodents of any kind (to my knowledge).  The building is quite old though - so while this means the rooms are better insulated than newer buildings, it also means that there are no anti-scald valves on the showers so they are prone to scalding you (on the bright side, there is always hot water).  The building is hot-water heated, so you cannot control the temperature of your apartment.  It can get very hot in the winter, and there is no air conditioning in the summer (no window AC units are allowed, but you can use other forms of AC).  The shared laundry is kept clean, but there is only two washers and two dryers (coin-operated)."
1650,SUSAN ANTLER,TORONTO,". from almost bankrupting my small business in the pandemic by literally kicking me out knowing i had no where to go or move my business.. to suddenly pretending she didnt know what i did for a living and deemed me and my small home business dangerous and more... Using lawyers to threaten me and more...  getting basic repairs was like pulling teeth. This is basically the worst human being you can ever hope to deal with.. 

Whats even more bizarre is she will not allow you to call her, will ignore you if she sees you in person, emails make her too ""anxious"" and will only use text message to communicate with you. It is an absolute bizarre situation of ""im too anxious "" well if you are so anxious.. why are you managing a property and people? She will simply expect you to pay your rent and shut up . 

AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
1651,ALVIN TIEU,OTTAWA,"Best landlord I have ever had! 10/10 landlord, would happily rent from him again!"
1652,EQUITON LIVING,HAMILTON,"Living conditions at the Equiton-owned building on Wellington/Cathcart St in Hamilton are absolutely horrendous. It is infested with cockroaches and mice that regularly get into units. Trash is often left piled up that aggravates the problem. Petty crime and drug use is also rife with laundry and package thefts commonplace (I’ve lost at least two Amazon parcels) and I’ve seen drug addicts in the building. One person let his dog defecate on the corridor and on another occasion a homeless person gained access to the laundry room and slept there. Security does nothing and tenant parking is also a mess. To top it all, management is often disrespectful and even racist towards some tenants. My post box was removed arbitrarily and I only found out when my key didn’t work and it took a week of messages and calls to get anything done. Totally sloppy and unprofessional. To top it all, Equiton are increasing the rent above provincial guidelines this year, adding insult to injury for many people already struggling to get by. Do not rent from Equiton. They are selfish, greedy and prey on the vulnerable. It took a visit from city bylaw officers to get basic repairs and pest control in."
1653,SAYED NOR,MERLIN,"Turned off the heat in the middle of Canadian winter to the empty unit downstairs from us which caused a burst pipe, leading to flooding in the units. 
Promised to have our bathtub replaced prior to us moving in, but instead PAINTED THE TUB causing so much paint chipping off the tub that I could not safely bathe my young children and babies in the tub. 
Overall, terrible communication. Constantly trying to come into our unit without at least 24hour notices, never repaired anything. Mold growing in both units after the flooding which never got repaired. Told us we had to leave so they could start repairs on pipes and didn't pay out the deposit of last months rent that we paid."
1654,NORMAN MCGREGOR (705PROPERTIES),SAULT STE. MARIE,Best landlord hands down. Gets stuff fix when asked and takes care of his tenants. Doesn’t charge crazy amount for rent.
1655,SKYLINE LIVING,NORTH BAY,"Skyline has a bad habit of mismanaging their buildings in North Bay.

They are slow to respond to major issues & care little for getting things done.

They put facades on their buildings to make them look pretty, when in fact they are riddled with mold, cockroaches & many other hidden problems.

They attempt to regularly increase rent by applying for above guideline increases for unnecessary cosmetic upgrades.

They claim smoke free buildings when in fact it is the exact opposite.  They tell you this to get you in, but then once rented, you realize that the majority of their buildings are filled with major smokers & marijuana users.

Buyer beware!"
1656,VISHAL UPPAL,DUNDALK,"He has several rental properties. After the first year he demanded that rent go up more than the legal increase amount allowed. He has text me other tenants contracts/personal information due to carelessness I believe. He uses reminders of his profession as a cop to bully and intimidate tenants. During lockdowns he regularly insisted on visiting our rental house. He bullies tenants and others into repairing things for him, otherwise items like my dishwasher sit awaiting repair. He will text several times in a row and/or call at the same time if he wants something from you."
1657,GENNARO DEL PRETE,KINGSTON,"He fixed everything that had to do with the lease very quickly.  However, one year when I was re-signing the lease, he lied to me and said that he wanted a witness to be there to witness the signing.  The person that he had there was actually there to have a quick look around the unit while I wasn't paying attention to look for any damages.  Eventually, this person contacted Kingston by-law and reported one of my cats for looking ""scruffy"" absolutely nothing ended up coming from that, and Gennaro lied to me when I confronted him about it.  Gennaro will threaten you with eviction if you are even one single day late with your rent.  One year when it was coming time soon to sign the lease, Gennaro told me that he wanted to inspect the unit and that his mother would be coming in to join the inspection as well.  I learned later on that his mother had the key to the property for some reason even though Gennaro was the only landlord I had ever known."
1658,GRUDZIEN,SCARBOROUGH,"Family that rents their basement - renovicters - but no written notice and no eviction notice to end tenancy. No notice before staring construction either. Tried to tell me to move at the end of the month right after asking me to pay $250 more a month. Harassed me, broke in to the unit late at night despite my saying no they could not enter at that time and to come back in the morning. Lied about reason stating “emergency” but it was actually to test water lines for the second basement apartment that were put in that day. Never gave 24 hours notice even after reminding numerous times that they were required to. Got to the point that they would literally just open the connecting door and come in to the unit without any notice or even courtesy to wait for the door to be answered. This was a bachelor basement unit - I could have been naked when they walked in! Furnace was broken for several months. It was 30 degrees most days all summer and then single digits come fall when they finally had it repaired. I never asked for other repairs so can’t say how they are with that. Only wanted to be paid in cash as they said they don’t want to pay tax on the money. Refused to provide a lease - make sure you know about the Ontario Standard Lease. Have no respect for tenants rights. Only nice while they are happy to take your money and then quickly become mean and harassing when they have collected enough from you. Unit is also not up to code as confirmed by a contractor I know and trust. The second basement apartment they were adding is also not legal and there’s no permit or inspection from the city on record. Electrical issues in the house that could be possible fire hazard. Various electricians came to check issues not sure if they ever fixed but definitely seemed sketchy. They will enter your unit for this as breakers are in the bachelor unit. Smoke alarm didn’t seem to function properly and no carbon monoxide detectors."
1659,MIKE KOEHLER,KITCHENER,"Super guy, Totally would rent from him again."
1660,HORMISDAS NTAHORUBUZE,OTTAWA,He evicted six students after we asked for repairs to the unit and a separate hydro bill between the two units. He evicted us so his 18 year old daughter could move into the two units. He then posted it on airbnb two months later.
1661,OREST KELEBAY,TORONTO,"Do not ever rent from this family in Bloor West village or High Park.  They are nightmares.   Greed, disorganized , cheap, amateur repairs,  rude, narcissistic,  difficult to engage"
1662,STRANO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,Rude and disregard for their tenants. Worst company ever. Left building with no hot water for more than a week. MISS “business development” straight up has an attitude problem even though you do everything she requests.
1663,ANJUMAN ARA NIPA,SCARBOROUGH,"Please stay away from this landlord at all costs! He seems nice up front and is greedy to take your money. You're better off living under a bridge. Living here is like living in hell. There is constant noise 24 7, it's rat infested, he doesn't repair anything, has kids running on top of your head until 2 am, cooks smelly fishy at all odd hours, just horrible!!!"
1664,PHILIP,NEWMARKET,Overall an amazing landlord.
1665,RYAN SIMEON ALI,ORANGEVILLE,House infested with mold. House isn’t up to code. Had to install own alarms. Always harassing us. Small man thinks he’s a big man. Such a stupid idiot. Worst slumlord.
1666,ANDY'S APARTMENTS,WATERLOO,"Ignores emails, tries to push unlawful agreements on renters, steals key deposits, and doesn't give notice of entry. Just a small sample of how bad this landlord is. If you have any other option than these people, take it."
1667,EVAN TRESTAN,HAMILTON,"No respect for tenants.  Records tenants coming and going and makes reference to these in a critical way.  Does nothing to stop or evict drug dealer tenants in other unit even though evidence has been recorded and sent to him. Have cops showing up several times a month because of other tenants who have just out of jail for assault guests staying with them. Does nothing to make sure other tenants in building feel safe.  Absolutely no soundproofing in separate units because his renovations only use the cheapest materials. Gives you a hard time if something isn’t working saying.. it’s brand new… shouldn’t be an issue.  
Says very inappropriate things to minor girls after spying on them on video camera.

No hot water for 2 weeks. 
Says washer and dryer are on site however refuses to replace washer that doesn’t get clothes clean and often doesn’t drain. Says it’s fixed but it’s not.  Went on for over 2 years."
1668,MD SULTANUR REZA,SCARBOROUGH,He and his wife are THE WORST LANDLORDS IN THE WORLD and  a renters WORST NIGHTMARE!!!
1669,PRANAY AGARWAL,BRAMPTON,...
1670,KEVIN SOUSA,LONDON,"Rented a bachelor apartment from kevin in 2020-2021 and he was amazing. Super kind, kept a very clean building and came as soon as there was an issue. He even volunteered and installed my window air-conditioner. Apartment was all inclusive and he had done a full reno before I moved in. I would rent again from him in a heartbeat"
1671,BILKENS,HAMILTON,"Overall generally happy, reapirs I wish would get done quicker."
1672,PHIL DORION,GARSON,"Phil gives notice before requiring access to the house, he is quick to respond and make a plan to fix repairs and follows up. He has only increased our rent the legal amount and gives us plenty of privacy. The parking lot area could use an upgrade and I know it would benefit the units however that hasn’t been addressed yet. Overall he’s been a great Landlord."
1673,DMS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MARKHAM,"Any DMS tenant knows that they do not enforce by-laws (e.g. non smoking properties), which leaves tenants sick and choking to death on the very thing they are supposed to be protected from. Repairs take a minimum of 3 weeks if not emergency. Never ask them to fix an existing appliance; they will just bring a ""new"" one - usually from their roach infested warehouse. No regard for black mold inside units. They enter your unit if and when they please (often when you are not home). Plus all the intimidation tactics (verbal abuse, threatening to add bogus charges to your rental account) or straight up ignoring emails and maintenance requests. Also, the cleaners they hire only come every 2 weeks, which leads to human/animal excrement, garbage, blood, needles piling up in common areas and in playgrounds -100/10"
1674,AMR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,The building is a complete mess . Takes forever to get things fixed . They don’t help at all . They are always renovating units which is noisy . I honestly do not recommend this place .
1675,JOSEPH LEVESQUE,SUDBURY,"The worst experience with a landlord ever, sadly this is not limited to this crack shack owner in our fair city. Outrageous rental rates for subpar accommodations, water damage, bad electrical, infestations. All of which is then blamed on the tenants who have never had any issues prior. 0/10 never EVER rent from him."
1676,LOREDANA MEROLLI AND FLAVIA FALLETTA,HAMILTON,"Advising of repairs will never happen , had to supply own detectors because of constant refusals, every year of illegal rent increases or will be threatened with evictions and constant showing up to the property without notice and trying to enter even when you refuse to let them enter"
1677,BRIARLANE LTD,ETOBICOKE,"This company treats the tenancy's like garbage 
Lack of repairs 
Old fridges 
Roaches galore
Rats galore 
The property manager was stealing tenant money when they paid their rent 
They don't clean the building 
When you complain they tell you to leave 
All the old tenants living in the building they are purposely not repairing their units because they want them out to Jack up the rent 
We are currently paying a rent increase that wasn't approved by the tenant board because they want to do repairs above guidelines"
1678,DEREK & TRACY SMITH,TORONTO,"My partner and I rented a the main floor unit in this house from Derek and Tracy for 5 years. One day they tried to get us to agree to pay more rent. We refused. They proceeded to evict us so they could use it for ""personal use"". Those are the facts, there's was lots of drama involved in the process - the key take away for anyone renting from them is to know that they are fine ish landlords, but they do not respect the tenant laws and/or their tenants when it really matters. Proceed with caution."
1679,BRIARLANE PROPERTY MANAGMENT,ETOBICOKE,"Sadly one of the worse landlords I've ever had.  Building is lipstick repaired at best, weekly water shutoffs.  Landlord jumps to threats, illegal statements, lies, illegal entry, illegal eviction notices, misleading statements on the laws."
1680,CAPREIT,LONDON,"Townhouse Complex at Blackacres Blvd

As a current tenant, I can attest that the shared areas of the condominium are consistently dirty and never properly cleaned. It's clear that the landlord is neglecting their responsibility to maintain a clean and safe living environment for their tenants.

In addition, the landlord has failed to renew any of the units in the building, which has resulted in numerous problems for me as a tenant. My unit is outdated and poorly maintained, and I've had to deal with several issues related to plumbing, electricity, and heating/cooling. When I've brought these issues to the landlord's attention, they've been slow to respond and often provide band-aid solutions rather than addressing the root cause of the problem.

Finally, the repair and maintenance procedures in this complex are simply terrible. The landlord seems to have no interest in investing in quality repairs or maintenance, and as a result, tenants are left to deal with ongoing problems that could easily be prevented with proper care. I'm incredibly disappointed with the quality of living in this building, and I'd strongly advise anyone considering renting here to look elsewhere."
1681,RICK AND CAROL CUNNINGHAM,PETERBOROUGH,"I had been living in a house with a group for multiple years and when the rest of my roommates moved out and new tenants came in Rick tried to increase my rent illegally by $100/month. He claimed it was a new group so it is a new lease, however, according to multiple lawyers and the landlord tenant agreement, the rent can only be increased by 2.2% per year regardless of the circumstances. On top of this he would have crews to come and work on the house with no notice. Overall, this landlord does not care to follow the law and will take advantage of student renters because he does not think they know the law."
1682,RLVNORTH,WATERLOO,"Constant state of disrepair, suspect drug use, would randomly send text messages that only had the words ""har har har"". I rate 0/8."
1683,NORTHEDGE 25 MABELLE AVENUE,ETOBICOKE,No parking available takes forever to resolve issues
1684,RAFFY DALLAL,TORONTO,Does not follow rent regulations. Tried to increase rent more than allowed and threatened to use condo for own use eviction if I didn't agree to huge rent increase.
1685,QIJIA BEI,MISSISSAUGA,"This is a house where two bedrooms are separately rented out, with landlord living at basement apartment. However, landlord find excuses to avoid signing the Ontario standard lease and so later on, can claim that the property is a boarding home, which will excuse them from landlord responsibilities and LTB regulations. Be warned of this new type of rental fraud."
1686,RENT PANDA THUNDER BAY,THUNDER BAY,"This was the worst experience of my life. The people from the property management changed weekly as they couldn't keep staff, the owner and another person came into my property several times without my permission when I wasn't home. There was no resolution for several concerns I had in the home and they wouldn't allow me to sublet when I left even though I found many satisfactory candidates. The worst experience of my life, I have never felt so disrespected and unsafe in my own home. Would never ever ever use this property management company. They don't work for the owner or the tenant."
1687,LYNN HOAR,HAMILTON,Lynn is a fantastic landlord. Helpful and respectful. I was incredibly fortunate to be her very first tenant. Her rental unit was immaculate.
1688,SANDRA THOMPSON AND GREENWIN INC.,NORTH YORK,Absolutely the worst management and ongoing issues that never get solved properly. Tenants’ well-being and safety are the last things on the property management mind!
1689,TENASSEE (MATT DIXON),WATERLOO,"Matt Dixon is horrible to deal with. Great rent, but threatens to evict and has 0 empathy."
1690,MARKET FLATS (GREENWIN),KITCHENER,"This place open up just more than a year and its car park is a joke, it is a stack parking and it took almost a year before its (kind of) fully functional. If it break down, you have no access to your car even its right in front of you. The gate of the garage is currently out of order, meaning it is wide open with public access, no secure at all. Not to mention there are so many wide animal try to build their home inside the garage, making scratches and TONS of bird drops onto your vehicle. 

People are letting their pets to release in the garage, making it super dirty and disgusting.  

Noise is another major problem. This place is build with thin walls and flooring, meaning you can hear EVERY STEPS when they adult walk and kids run which will drive you crazy. When I send Greenwin a message seeking for help, they just ask me to call the city by-law! 

Majority portion of the utility bills were admin fees instead of your usage, only internet is included.

This place is being advertised as ""luxury apartment"" and it is far from it. When they even included ""Elevator"" as one of the PROPERTY FEATURES, you know something is not right.

They just could not care less once you signed the agreement, period."
1691,GREENROCK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT LTD,TORONTO,"Although the rental rates are very high, they are a very good landlords who are quite responsive to my needs as a tenant."
1692,WOOLNER HOLDINGS,YORK,Extremely disrespectful lazy management building full of pests and the management goes above and beyond to avoid doing any maintenance or repairs lots of drug activity in the stairwells cameras don’t work security is lazy and does nothing also
1693,LOUISA AND GIDEON TSANG,TORONTO,"They will speak to you nicely and then try to jack up your rent illegally. If the house needs any repairs, they will send you the least qualified and cheapest repair person they can possibly find. They will engage their real estate agent to work with you — he’s the one who makes most of the illegal suggestions, his name is Ken Chu. They knowingly rent out a moldy house and if you mention the mold to them they will tell you to clean it with bleach (a practice that will make YOU sick and will actually increase the amount of mold in the house longterm). They will illegally keep your rental deposit for cleaning. Be extremely careful when dealing with any of these people."
1694,LINCOLN TOWERS,ETOBICOKE,"The landlords at this building are shady. They try to charge for AC units in the summer months while most tenants pay their own hydro. They state the units have “in unit thermostats” these do not work. It’s constantly hot. Units are over priced, garage is only accessible by elevator on the top parking level, p2 must use stairs. Front doors to building only have hands free operation, which only work when it is not the slightest bit windy, most often broken, all other doors are not wheelchair accessible. Landlord is often not available during office hours and will be rude to practically anyone who has to walk through her door.

They also made the terrible decision to replace the carpets in the communal hallways with tile so the halls are loud and echo excessively at all times."
1695,JILANI GROUP INC,TORONTO,Very bad service and increased maintenance fee. they are group of person without credit!
1696,GREENWIN,NORTH YORK,"No hot water for months, lack of security. Tenants parking vandalized and over 15 tenants cars vandalized. No lease agreements."
1697,LEAH B,GUELPH,"Absolutely love Leah, one of the best landlords I’ve ever had. Friendly, down to earth and is very fair."
1698,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"The unit was not ""move-in ready"" when I got my keys, there was no heat or hot water. I called the after hours line which went to voicemail and the on-call agent that called me back was unable to come to address it as he had been drinking at the time. Very unprofessional. We moved in the winter and once the snow melted we found out that the back lawn in the listing photos had not been cleared the prior fall and the grass had all rotted under the dead leaves. KWPM took all summer to fix this despite constant emails and phone calls. They are slow to address any tenant concerns but when they need something they expect it to be handled right away. Would not rent a property from them again."
1699,BERNIE & OKSANA LADWIG,ETOBICOKE,"Bernie and Oksana were perfectly satisfactory landlords and property managers during my tenancy at one of their Etobicoke buildings. They did not go ""above and beyond"", but they were always quick to respond to issues with our unit. If repairs were needed, Bernie himself would drop by within 24 hours to see if his handyman skills could fix it, or if he needed to send in hired help to do so. He fixed kitchen plumbing, reinstalled a hoot handle and realigned a doorframe for us, and even reinstalled a lighting fixture.

We had a few problems with other tenants (usual noise complaints, etc) and Bernie and Oksana mediated as best they were allowed when things escalated. The issues with those tenants were eventually why we moved, but when we had to take possession of our new place early, they were happy to refund our last month's rent (as they found a tenant to sign a lease for what would have been out last month of tenancy).

Overall they were reasonable people taking decent care of a much older low-rise building by the Lakeshore. While they never went out of their way to upgrade the property, they kept it as clean and functional as they were able, a d were quick to deal with any issues we had. If I moved again and they had a suitable unit, I wouldn't hesitate to lease from them again."
1700,RAFAEL TABLADA ( M&R HOLDINGS ),TORONTO,Rafael Tablada is the property manager for M&R Holdings. He does not answer to emails and can never be got on the phone. He treats the building like his own personal kingdom and tenants are his subjects. 
1701,BIRCHWOOD VILLAGE - SIREG MGMT,NORTH BAY,"I’ve never had a problem in the 3 years I have been renting my townhouse. Any issues I have are always taken care of when I call in, the office and maintenance team are professional. I would recommend this area for sure"
1702,JASPERS FAYER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - ORANGEVILLE,ORANGEVILLE,Jaspers Fayer property management in Orangeville. They are unprofessional. Rude. Ignore maintenance or repair requests. Do not appropriately deal with tenants that harrass and threaten other tenants. Speak to tenants in a condescending way. Try to blame tenant for anything that breaks or things that are completely out of tenants control. They do less than the bare minimum. Absolute slumlords. They are a father daughter duo and they both need an attitude adjustment. His daughter Ashley is a brat and literally every other tenant I've talked to feels the same way.  Disgusting.
1703,NATTY URQUIZO,OTTAWA,"Our landlord does not repair anything properly, if ever. When confronted with issues of appliances, she chooses to blame it on us, the tenants. Even though, we haven’t been here long enough to cause any kind of structural or substantial damage. She is not the most respectful, and does not give us the most privacy for the most part.  She also doesn’t understand Ontario tenant rights and laws, and if she does, she completely ignores it."
1704,GANDULF-MAYFAIR CORPORATION,OTTAWA,"Avoid these landlords at all cost.  Slum lords.  Unsafe buildings, and refuse to repair when you bring safety issues to them.  Even when it's a clear fire code violation.  I had to report them to the city, who sent an inspector, who was disgusted with what he saw and forced them to make the repairs.  They used the back of the building lot as a garbage dump.  Getting things repaired was a nightmare. Incredibly rude when you bring to their attention they ar emote providing services theybar elegantly required to.  Such as, clearing snow for a paid parking spot/lot.  I had to shovel out the parking area several times just to get to work.  When I complied thatbtheybar eneglecting to clear the snow and are required to as they charge for parking, I was treated with taking my parking away from me.  They don't like to turn on the heat when winter comes.  Had a new born  and an apartment that was 18 degrees Celsius with the sun beaming in.  Rude, incompetent and vindictive.  After I reported them to the city, and were given 2 weeks to make the building safe and acceptable for rental, they raise day rent as much as the legally could.  The only good thing that came of renting from them is it was such a horrid experience I decided to meet with a mortgage broker and see if I can afford to buy a house.  Luckily I was just able to afford to buy and not deal with slumlords like Gandulf-Mayfair again.  AVOID their rental units."
1705,WESLEY F. DING\ CROWNEX LTD.,ETOBICOKE,"This landlord is the definition of slumlord. 12 years at this property not a single repair ever made. When the fridge and stove went I had to replace myself. A broken eaves trough broke one of my windows, he refused to fix the window then blamed me for the window being broken. The neighbour was involved in criminal activity with police showing up weekly and never did anything. My hydro bill had gone up to 400$ a month for a very tiny 2 bedroom, I suspected my landlord so falsely led him to believe that I would be having Toronto Hydro come to investigate, magically my hydro bill went down to under 150$ a month the next month. Found out from previous tenants that they use their tenants hydro to run their business that is downstairs. Refused to provide proper garbage cans, 3 apartments, 9 tenants total and we were told to share two small garbage bins and 1 recycling bin. In the middle of the pandemic I received a notice that we had to leave because of serious repairs needed, the roof caving in and a wall would have to be removed, in actuality no repairs were ever done(I kept a close eye on the building after as I suspected raising the rent was the real reason) and apartment went up for rent 1 month after I left for double the rent I had been paying. Stay away!"
1706,RYAN SIMEON ALI,ORANGEVILLE,"Ryan Ali is the worst human being we have come across in our lives. He lies about everything, the dumbest things. He will not fix anything to the point of having to call the town to help. He calls your family if he can’t get ahold of you, which is mind blowingly inappropriate. If you ask to communicate over phone calls. He texts you. If you ask to communicate over email, he will text and call you non stop 30 times a day. It gets so bad you have to change your phone number. His favourite line is “it’s not about the money it’s about the respect” which we all have figured out it is about the money, he has a respect complex, probably stemming from childhood, where he was never respected. If you don’t do what he says he will make your life a living hell. He will call you names, call your children names and he will call your bluff and harass you to no end. Even after you’ve moved out. 


 He owns 15+ properties and this review is actually coming from a group of us who used to rent from him or currently rent from him. 

Do not enter into a rental with RYAN SIMEON ALI."
1707,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,Cockroach infested hellhole. Other tenants had problems for months and months without ever being addressed. Rude. Has threatened other tenants with violence. Drives a Lamborghini to his busted decrepit slum rentals. Bad dude.
1708,ROBERT HODGSON,WATERLOO,This landlord is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's not up to fire code and there is mold growing in the basement  He also repairs and parks cars in the parking lot..  when the winter co.es he does not clear the sidewalks or the driveway properly.
1709,BK REAL ESTATE,MIDLAND/BARRIE,Rented from them for years harrassed us. expected us to do things beyond the lease agreement such as yard and grass cutting. Tried to make us pay for repairs until I said I'd be putting it through my insurance. Let my children live in moldy conditions after a leak because it was 'fine' because the floor had no give to it?
1710,LISA CARLINI,ERIN,She was okay at first but then decided I was talking advantage by having guests over. We were quiet and respectful but she didn't seem aware of my rights as a tenant. She also kept the heat well below the required level and was pretty loud when I was trying to sleep. 0/10.
1711,MAI TRAN,KITCHENER,"This is a student housing rented out by the landlord, targeting mainly students of Conestoga College. This place is more expensive than other student housing on the same street.

Don't be fooled by the price and pictures on Kijiji. The price posted on kijiji is for those who are renting with a 1-year-lease. Pictures were taken long time ago and doesn't reflect the real situation. Have to pay extra for laundry and the machines are timed. There are many rules in the house but not strictly enforced. The landlord would assign cleaning and garbage-take-out duties to tenants but with no enforcement or any fairness. The quality of living really depends l on how responsible and clean your housemates are, since the landlord does not care or enforce the rules. The landlord only send cleaners right before showing the house.

Would suggest to look somewhere else unless this is your last resort. The landlord sometimes visits the property without notice and stays in the common area."
1712,OLD OAK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"Old Oak is terrible when it comes to repairs. Building management is also extremely slow with communication. Considering the amount of money they are charging for rent, Forest Hill is a dump."
1713,TATIANA (WHITE PINES APT),ETOBICOKE,"TERRIBLE LANDLORD! First and foremost I have to say this apartment is disgustingly old. Shit ton of cockroaches and they do not do ANYTHING about it. The landlord is RUDE it is hard to approach her, she does not listen to your concerns. It is impossible to even speak to her about anything. She does not take care of her tenants let alone does not take care of the building itself. She needs to be replaced ASAP!"
1714,CORAL HILLS,BARRIE,"Can’t be bothered to email you back. Went 19 days last winter without a furnace, had to use electric heaters. They take care of the junkies, because their daughter is one. Any company they hire aren’t reputable and don’t clean up after themselves. Failed to mention that if we get a lot of rain our basement will flood, had mold due to said issue and they dropped off a bottle of mold killer for us to deal with. They’re useless. It’s Coral hills managing the property but it’s DMS who owns the properties. Contacted DMS about issues and they couldn’t be bothered either. Dalton has been rude to my wife in more than one occasion. But hey, their junkie daughter has a place with sketchy people all the time, one of her junkie friends tried to just walk right into our run it one time so we called the cops and had him arrested."
1715,HIGHRISE HOLDINGS LTD,SCARBOROUGH,"Money monger, minimum or no service to the tenants, condecending to temants if anyone raise cincern, poor window fiiting, hardly repair any issues, often garbage shute and elevator geta broken for weeks, cockroaches, but increases rwnt on the regular basis"
1716,BETTY NG,ORILLIA,"We moved in and everything was great, up until we asked her to have the dryer looked at because it stopped working. We also had put up our trampoline for our kids to play (we take it down in the fall every year). Since then our landlord and her guests that live across the road from us have belittled us, called us racist, taken away all our rights and disrespected us so much we've had to call the police 4 times! She refuses to do any repairs due to lack of money, although is rebuilding a building on the property into a cottage for herself. She has served us with 2 N12's now and has lost going to the LTB due to her lies. She has tried to take away our parking, says we are not allowed guests to be here or have our dog. We have filed a T2 with the LTB and are awaiting our hearing. She loves treating her tenants as children and thinks she is above all. She allows her guests to have more rights on the property than her tenants, we are not allowed to have pets or fires but they are. We lived here for 9 months without working smoke detectors and had to call the fire marshall in order for her to do anything. I wish we would've known before moving here how stressful and mentally draining it would be!"
1717,GHAZALS QADRI,OAKVILLE,"This landlord uses her realtor to manage the property. The realtor is totally disorganized and doesn’t follow through with commitments. 

They don’t give clear instructions for repairs, they send the most ineffective repair contractors so you deal with the same issues over and over again. They send random people to the home with no noticed you are stuck dealing with the intrusions or having to call around to figure out if these people are legitimate.

Landlord lied to evict tenants to raise rent for their next tenant - this was done several times. I’d stay far away from her, waste of time for any professionals."
1718,MORGUARD NAR CANADA LP,TORONTO,Morguard is by far the worst landlors we have ever dealt with.  The staff at their management office are very rude and uncooperative. They do not respond to maintenance requests on time and would not fix most things. Very unprofessional.
1719,KEN TISDALE,MISSISSAUG,"Awful.
Walked in while I was in labour even though I asked him to come another time he said ""I own the place I can go in when I want"" he harrases us on social media if we dont respond to texts. Refuses to fix anything. When we couldnt pay our rent during covid (the gov gave us a cheque for him) to get it back to good standing he made fun of us saying ""clearly you cant afford my home"" has made multiple threats."
1720,HANLYN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"Recently moved from a long-term lease with a private slumlord to a new unit under Hanlyn - they had good reviews and feedback from current and former tenants online, as well as contractors that have done some work for them, so I specifically pursued finding a unit under their management, as finding a similarly reputable company in Hamilton proved impossible.  I did learn, upon move-in, that Hanlyn provides incentive to their tenants and contacts to leave positive reviews, however the incentive would certainly not be enough for me to keep quiet about any day-to-day issues if I were to have any, so I don't see this as particularly ""scammy"" - more like thanks for helping out with a little Tim's card.  Regardless, my experience from viewing the unit to signing to move-in and now active tenancy has been fantastic.  I'm a licensed paralegal and was very pleased to witness the company follow all legal procedure and requirements of the RTA throughout every phase of the process, including proper standard Ontario lease agreements with correct clauses in place, and RTA approved timeline commitments for various considerations.  They provide an online maintenance request portal where you can request urgent or non-urgent maintenance support in your unit - I have always had maintenance requests replied to within 2 hours tops during business hours, and I've never experienced more than a 48-hour turnaround to have maintenance out to my place for minor/non-urgent requests.  There is an afterhours line for urgent requests outside of business hours.  Any maintenance or fixtures I've requested have been completed very quickly and to my satisfaction.  The unit was extremely dirty upon move-in and hadn't had a thorough clean between tenants, however I acknowledge that it was being shown for upwards of 2 months and many people were in and out of the unit during that time.  I recently received notice of spring maintenance, and they came by to do a check of my smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, cleaned out dryer vents, and hooked up outdoor water supply.  They are thorough and seem to practice in compliance with RTA, and if I'm not in touch, they leave me alone.  Very happy with my situation so far, such a breath of fresh air after having my rights trampled for 10 years by the last one!"
1721,NISHNAWBE HOMES,TORONTO,"I lived at 244 Church Street.  It's a rooming house, downtown Toronto.  The rate was a little much, for under 50 square feet, but, you're in the heart of Toronto, and everything is nearby. 
Bedbugs were a problem.  People smoking in their rooms, was also a problem.  If you're on the first floor, people walk through your kitchen, and sometimes steal stuff from the fridge.
Staff turnover was high, especially at the front desk, so it wasn't always safe. I'd still recommend it to friends, especially if they want to be downtown."
1722,DREWLO HOLDINGS,SARNIA,Too many restrictions regarding use of the common room and pool area. Building managers too often not in their office and their overall attitude towards tenants is disrespectful.
1723,GOWAN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"when there are snow storms we have to wait 3 days to have plows come through, wait months for repairs to be completed , building is kept unclean , build is infested with mice"
1724,WIGWAMEN INC,"TORONTO, ONTARIO","I have lived at one of their Toronto buildings, for 3 years now.  In that time, they have done any repairs (including floor tiles, accidentally damaged by my desk chair.) They've been quick when other tenants have bedbugs, and have made sure other tenants don't get them.  When it was reaching 30C inside my unit, they had a maintenance person come and install a ceiling fan the next day.    They installed a elongated ""chair height"" toilet, to help with my Ehlers-Danlos.  The building managers have been good, and done good.  They don't bug you, they don't harass, and they help if you request it.  When ODSP messed up my rent, instead of sending me an LTB notice, they simply tested me, and asked me to look into it.  I called my worker, she called Wigwamen, and the payment was resent.  

I 100% recommend Wigwamen to all my indigenous friends, as Wigwamen cares."
1725,"JAMES ""HERB"" GAMBLE",LINDSAY,"While Herb respects tenants privacy, all that means is he is disengaged in the activities that go on within the property. The building is often in a state of disrepair extending to the roof and water leaking into units (going unrepaired), water services (radiant heat and running water), washing machines, mold exposure, and main security doors. Tenants go without heat and hot water in the winter regularly. Windows are outdated and not secure. Fire escape is unsafe for use (many tenants have been told not to use it).
Contrary to the Ontario LTB act, many tenants smoke in the building in addition to other unacceptable activities such as woodworking in the hallways, trash and unwanted items piling up in common areas and more. 
Herb has successfully evicted problem tenants in the past, only to replace them with new problemed renters, this is largely due to a lack of due diligence in the screening process. 
While Herb abides by certain LTB act rules with regards to rental increases, he does not properly maintain the units in the building resulting in poor living conditions. Promises of new flooring, new windows and other basic repairs go unfulfilled for years."
1726,786 HAMDANI LTD,THOROLD,"The actual owner is very hands off, and the Superintendent (Judy Cunningham) does far less than even the bare minimum needed to keep the building in order. cockroaches, constant maintenance issues, damages, half-assed and patchwork ""repairs"". The list goes on and on. Also a complete lack of knowledge or awareness of the RTA and their responsibilities. They also threaten to evict anyone who stands up for their rights or pushes back against the bullying tactics."
1727,PLATINUM PROPERTIES GROUP,ELLIOT LAKE,"149 Mississauga Ave, Elliot Lake, ON. P5A 2P9
Lackluster piss poor maintenance record. Place has been falling apart, neglected for years.
Mould in apartment.
Maintenance requests go mainly unanswered, or when its nessessary, is done cheaply and slowly.
Landlord and its agent allows neighbours to allow their pets to bark and howl continually and tell people that complain to submit green forms, and dont address the issue."
1728,METCAP,MISSISSAUGA,Office staff are ghetto and loud with each other. They could acknowledge tenants a bit better. Sometimes Tenants are a bit overboard but sometimes they just want to be acknowledged.
1729,SYD BIRRELL,PETERBOROUGH,"Nightmare of a landlord. Disrespectful of tenants and property scrapes past tenant safety laws on technicalities due being ""grandfathered in"" to the old rules. It's very comforting to know during a fire when you can't escape that your firey death will be liability-free because of the age of the building.

Impossible to get a hold of directly, and doesn't expect tenants to know their rights. Tried to force me to pay the entirety of my last month's rent again after the first year instead of topping it up for a rent increase. He casually ""forgot"" to give me the interest on my last month's rent payment until I demanded it to cover the cost of the rent increase (which again, he wanted the entire month as a whole payment, not just a top-up). Also put illegal no-pets clauses in his lease. He shared my personal contact (though not legally confidential) information to some of his other tenants without consent and not because of any sort of emergency. 

He never explicitly breaks landlord-tenant laws, but he sure appears to love dancing around the line and testing what he can get away with- in my personal opinion."
1730,SAJEDA AKHTAR,TORONTO,"Sajeda and her husband Mo did not keep the house in good repair. You would often have to call several times to get something fixed, they would come and do a bandaid solution, only for the problem to continue or get worse. They also threatened to sell the house and then when I moved out, they raised the rent by $800. They also take advantage of those who don’t know the RTA, eg claiming they can charge you more rent if you have someone move in with you."
1731,EFFORT TRUST - KENSINGTON APARTMENTS,HAMILTON,"picky, short fused landlords that don’t finish repairs at all or in timely manner. apartment is infested with cockroaches and they do not block spray. Building also has bedbugs they don’t appropriately treat. They continue to raise rent but can’t even wash the incredibly dirty windows to the units. Don’t rent here."
1732,IMRAN LALANI,MARKHAM,May decide to evict you in the middle of your lease term. When we moved in the place was filthy
1733,UNITED LOFTS,WOODSTOCK,"Not much maintenance keeping the grounds clean. Theyre not too helpful either. For example, if your fridge stopped working you would have to argue the landlords replaces it. They will, but they'll try to argue against it if they can get away with it. If you know your rights, they'll comply. Otherwise, they're shady and money hungry."
1734,YASMIN LALANI,MARKHAM,May decide to evict you in the middle of your lease term. When we moved in the place was filthy
1735,NAZIMA ALAM,PICKERING,"Landlord Damaged our personal vehicles, constantly showed up unannounced. we had multiple leaks from our upstairs tenants which they refused to fix/pay for. After living in the unit for not even 3 weeks our hydro was disconnected because the landlord wasn’t paying any utilities, they then made us register for accounts for the rental unit to pay utilities ourselves.
Never worked out a contract for yard work or snow removal and then neglected to take care of it. 
On top of the physical issues both Nazima and her husband Shaik were EXTREMELY rude everytime we spoke with them about issues and only did what was needed or were respectful when we threatened flu bc to the landlord tenant board."
1736,PAUL FAJSZAN (NOGRAD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),DUNDAS,"This slumlord is the worst I have come across in my 22 years of renting. Building is falling apart, he refuses to do any repairs, I had to fight with him for 2 years to change my carpets, that he said he would replace when we first moved in that had 2 inch rips from wall to wall, in three different sections of the apartment. He has harassed me for over two years now, calling me all sorts of names and cussing me out, he has gone tenant to tenant defaming my fiance and I, telling them we are scam artists, that we are criminals, and tried to gather all their signatures to try and use it against us when he served us a unauthorized bad faith N12 form. He also served us an N5 trying to claim the carpets were soaked in urine from our cats, and that we owed him $1,600. When I asked for the receipt from the company, he refused to give it to me. When the date finally came for the hearing for the N12, it was dismissed, as it was unauthorized, corporations cannot issue N12. My fiance was walking home from the store, and he tried to run her over, because he was so upset that he lost the case. We had filed a T2, back in April of 2022, it is now April 2023, and still waiting for our hearing date. He also works for CanadaPost, and was caught going through my mail, which I am currently disputing with the Ombudsman. The building is filled with bugs, and his answer to complaints for that is we are in a country area... There are no locks and no buzzer to enter the building, and we always find homeless or mentally ill people sleeping in our lobby, he refuses to do anything about it. He was caught on video multiple times harassing us. I wish the LTB would take tenant matters as serious as they do Landlord matters, as I stated we filed a T2, and he filed an N12 4 months after we filed. And his case was heard before ours. The system is totally unfair and broken. We fiance can't even do laundry, because his apartment is right across from the machines. She is absolutely terrified as he has threatened us with violence multiple times, which we have numerous police reports against him. During his unauthorized N12, which under oath he claimed he would be taking our apartment for himself, he put the building up for sale. Bottom line... STAY AWAY from this property."
1737,SPARTAN INC.,INGLESIDE,"Has tried to raise rent more than allowed, outside maintenance is terrible, in the winter lots of ice build up in the parking lot and walkways, sometimes it takes days to get the lot and walkways cleared, windows Need to be upgraded."
1738,BEN MARTIN,TORONTO,"Before moving here we were first warned  by the tenant that was moving out, that this Landlord would show up and let himself in her unit, which as a woman living there she felt unsafe. She also warned us about repairs and that he will use every excuse possible just to not pay for repairs,and many other shady practices that we only started to realize after we had been there for just a couple months. Fast forward,a fire happenned on this block and our building was untouched, it was also at the beginning of the month so we had JUST paid rent. but he sneakily got us to move all our stuff and put into storage because supposedly there was some work to be done to our unit, then tried to claim that because of the fire this was a frustrated contract, and he gets to rent it to someone else if he wants to and doesn't need to refund the rent paid for that month AND was keeping out Last month rent and completely ghosted us. We got help from.the Ontario tenants group and long story short took him to the LTB. He missed the first hearing and lied that he didn't know about it, but the LTB wasn't taking that excuse. And after seeing how far we were willing to take this and that he risks to get fined by the LTB,he started offering the unit back claiming that he didn't know the laws, mind you this landlord is a lawyer. So the idea that he doesn't know rental laws is just pathetic as this info is available with a little research. Long story short,he begged us to withdraw our LTB claim in exchange of 2months free rent...we ended up negotiating 3 months, and  he wanted to split our storage fees and refused to accept full responsibility.  This became just a frustrating place to live and after another year of him making our lives a living hell we ended up moving out."
1739,MANO ANASTASAKIS,HAMILTON,"I had an awesome experience renting from Mano. He was friendly, responsive, and always went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. The apartment was well-maintained, and any issues were promptly addressed. I highly recommend him."
1740,JORDAN FROHLICK,SUDBURY,Jordan has been the best landlord I have ever had hands down! No matter when I call him he has the issue fixed asap. He is respectful and polite at all times and will accommodate if needed. He keeps his properties in tip top condition. I would recommend any property owned by Jordan. He has even helped me with other non rental related issues and provided good advice to my partner and I.
1741,SPM - STRANO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,Worst property management EVER! If you’re thinking about renting a unit with them RUNNNN. Zero respect to their tenants at all and disregard to the people the rent from them. It’s unfortunate that they are buying up every thing in sight so less quality landlords have the properties now.
1742,TAMARA,OTTAWA,"Amazing landlords, very respectful and easy to talk to. The only problem they would sometimes not mention having showing for other rooms in the house so I would be woke up early to them walking around with people showing the room next to me"
1743,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"My name is Eymen Burak. This company is a slumlord. A notorious racist is the superintendent. He is a disgusting human being. He discriminates if you are black/brown and if you are homosexual. He said bad things about South Indian but never has the courage to tell us to our face. He said he doesn’t like brown skin people so he send them far away from him. He laugh he said he sent one brown couple in the garbage room area.
He calls the security guys shit skins because they are South Indian.
He calls the property manager Chinese mango because she is Asian. Someone else from the management company he calls tariyaki sauce be cause he is Japanese? This guy is short with a typical middle eastern nose and facial trait.
He tells everybody in our community center that he is the boss of the building. He offer 1 bachelor for 1 day at 50$. 150$ for the weekend. No lease no contract just cash money give to him. We go late afternoon in the office and see the cameras everything he lets people in the offices and rooms."
1744,JANE TONG,BARRIE,"Constant harassment, belittling and salnder. She couldn't get ahold of us for a week as my phone broke & couldn't get a new one without waiting for a little, and she called our references and told them things about us that weren't true, said I was in jail and my husband was beating me & had gotten the cops to come to our house to do a well checkup on me. 
 If you don't answer her texts within a few minutes she will continually text you, call you and even email you, whether you are at work or sleeping or even in a hospital, or even dealing with a death in the family according to her you should always answer her, in her opinion you should also be like best friends with her and text her every day.  And for repairs, be prepared to spend a whole day with her in your house because she refuses to hire a professional and doesn't know a thing about appliances or any other thing and will just keep doing things that seem like it's fixing it but it isn't, and also during that time her husband will sit in the backyard and do nothing & if you don't watch her she will go wondering into rooms for no reason."
1745,SHARANIVIR MINHAS,THOROLD,"First time ever renting for our little family of 4 and it's been a nightmare since we moved in!!! We should of known better when we were asked for anything and everything except our first born in order to even be accepted to live in this place. Do not rent from him ever unless you want to be harassed, watched by hidden cameras and more!!!! Stay far far away .... Never renting again!!! He rents places in Thorold and most likely Toronto and other places too!"
1746,GREG CHITILIAN,MARKHAM,Does not maintain properly
1747,CHRISTINA DAVID,OTTAWA,"We got bed bugs and she refused to spray. We're still in court. She never did any repairs to the unit. Would have people come and walk around the property without given notice. She did replace a broken washer but it took 3 months and she never reimbursed us for the cost to go to the laundromat. Overall, wasn't a great experience and were glad to be moving."
1748,REALSTAR,KITCHENER,Not great. Not amazing.
1749,EDWARD ROSEN,TORONTO,"One of the most unqualified landlords I've ever met. There is on-site laundry that hasn't been repaired in at least 7 years so tenants are told to use the laundry across the road, which is actually decent but if you're going to tell people on-site laundry it should be available. All leaks in the apartment were met with a No Frills bag instead of being sealed or investigated. Upon moving into the apartment no cleaning was done and he tried to blame my roommates and I for the level of dirt despite photos from move in showing otherwise. When asked when our oven would be cleaned (as it was unusable upon move-in) he tried to bill my roommates and I for the cleaning. During the actual cleaning, he didn't know I was home, he was talking poorly about my roommates and I and threatened violence. The Bylaw officer in South Parkdale knows Edward and his various properties well. After the oven incident we hired a lawyer and he yelled at us and the lawyer for A) getting a lawyer and B) yelled at my roommates and I for talking to other people in the building.

Avoid this landlord when possible."
1750,WESTMOUNT TOWERS (EFFORT TRUST),HAMILTON,"I've lived here for several years. The supers & assistant supers are excellent. They are respectful, quick with answers to any inquires/questions and very nice."
1751,MATT AND JASMINE SRNICEK,LONDON,"A nice couple. Occasionally a bit nosey and the one time I had people over said it was too loud. Kind of annoying to have someone breathing down your neck while you're in your space. I don't regret it, either way."
1752,GWL REALTY ADVISORS,TORONTO,"I recently had a very unpleasant experience with a property management company. I was shocked by how disorganized they were. It seemed like they had no idea what they were doing, and I was constantly left feeling frustrated and confused. It was almost as if they were making things up as they went along, and it was incredibly frustrating to deal with. I would never recommend this company to anyone, and I hope that others can avoid the same awful experience that I had."
1753,PIERO COLATOSTI,ANGUS,"Constantly stops by, belittles you if you don’t have an empty and spotless house.. literally told me I shouldn’t have anything in my backyard except grass. Has no concept of the RTA, when he’s wrong about something he tries to evict. His wife, Gina, is arrogant, stuck up and will judge you about anything and everything. Very rude and unpleasant people. 

We ended up needing a repair, they lost their mind on us and ended up serving an N12, we left because they are too much to deal with between the constant phone calls, driving by and coming to the door to see inside. Piero told us to our face that he would be spying on us and we wouldn’t know. We rented through a property management company and they still harassed us constantly."
1754,LILIANA PEREIRA,LONDON,"This landlord rented me a three bedroom house. She then eliminated access to the basement (where the laundry facilities were) and tried to build a second unit. She boarded up access to the basement and laundry utilities while we were at work. She continued the work for MONTHS, all hours of the day, and on weekends. There was dust everywhere. It was incredibly troubling and we ended up taking her to court. It ruined our first rental experience, wholeheartedly. I couldn't believe this could be allowed. Not only to enter my home with no notice, but to essentially split my rental home into two. What these landlords get away with is sickening. She should never be able to rent a home again, but alas I know she has and she's a realtor too."
1755,CAOSHENG,SCARBOROUGH,"Doesn't maintain the place, delivered rental with damage on the walls and uneven colours, smudges, dirt, not cleaned. Floor squeaks all the time and is difficult to sleep. Comes over to garden despite the house being rented to us. Waters the garden on our water bill."
1756,ALYSSA GREEN,PETERBOROUGH,"Stay away! Alyssa Green is the landlord and SISTER of the upstairs tenant, Marisa, at *********. I’ll try to summarize the nightmare that living there was: constant emails over the most minor of complaints - basically you were to live beneath them unseen and unheard. No more than one pair of shoes in the main entrance, nothing on the landing going down to your unit (not even for a few hours), nothing on the porch, nothing outside your door. Cold, heartless glares from Marisa whenever crossing paths. Alyssa issued me FIVE eviction notices in the 13 months I was there and they were all thrown out when we got before the board with her having to pay me. During my prep for our trial I contacted the tenant prior to me who vouched for her insane behaviour and expectations of a tenant. This is clearly a pattern and they are not capable of cohabitating with anyone peacefully in that house. Not to mention the apartment is a shoebox with terrible temperature regulation - it’s either too hot or too cold, with minimal sunlight from a window under their deck. I know the rental market is horrendous and you need to take what you can get but, please, keep looking. Good luck! <3"

1759,ANKUSH N,KITCHNER,One of the best land lords to deal wit . He helped us with all the tools required to do summer and winter maintaince. gave us hosses and sprinklers to maintain the backyard. Very imvolved in duties with the property
1760,ADRIAN AND CRISTINA OF CELLUPICA INVESTMENTS,ST. CATHARINES,"These landlords care nothing about the tenants and solely about money. The apartment I rented from them looked “renovated” but was in fact barely holding together. The floors were peeling up, the windows (ones that actually opened) didn’t have proper handles, we had to use adjustable wrenches to turn the knobs. The biggest windows in the apartment didn’t open, were stuck shut completely. The ONLY AC unit in the apartment was very small and could not keep the entire unit cold. When I asked if I could install another window AC unit I was told no and to shut my blinds to keep the hot sun out (genius!). It was a 3 unit building, with 1 washer and dryer - that flooded the basement on MULTIPLE occasions. Meaning I’d have to take my kids and I laundry elsewhere to have clean clothing. They decided that the house didn’t need any grass, or any kind of yard and paved it. Great! The only problem is, it’s a 1 way in 1 way out space. A VERY narrow driveway. Getting a vehicle in and out of there was AWFUL. They expected 3 vehicles to park there when we struggled to put 2 cars side by side without hitting eachother.. want out of the driveway? 8 point turn. Make sure you don’t hit the broken, falling over fence that is covered in nails that stick out and will slice your hand - like it did my daughters. When you bring any issues to the attention of Adrian he will call you and belittle you. He will call you names, he will tell you how rich he is and how he doesn’t need to deal with any of this. When you bring anything to Cristina, she will talk to you like you’re below her. On multiple occasions, the tenants they moved in below us were extremely loud and disrespectful. When I reached out I was basically told it’s a shared building and to deal with it. 
And when I finally had enough and decided to move - Adrian said “good! Now I can raise the rent!” 
Do NOT rent from these people. They will make you feel as though you aren’t worthy of their HORRIBLY renovated apartment that they overcharge for."
1761,JOSEPH MATTEIS,CHATHAM,"Joe was a really good landlord, willing to let me pay past the first if I had to wait on my paycheque. He is old fashioned in terms of only accepting cash, and maybe cheques, but not e-transfer. Though he’s older and hard of hearing, he was still very nice. Kept rent way below market value, but the house/unit was probably in need of more than just surface repairs (ie: new paint jobs, cracks in the wall, clearing out bugs/spiders from basement). All in all though one of the better landlords I’ve had."
1762,KARMIRIS,BRANTFORD,"They told three low income house that she sold the place ( her son is a realtor agent) they even put signs up,  saying it was sold. all three family went into hotels and the next week she post they were up for rent again, she upped the rent by 700.00 per place"
1763,LAURA AVILA,HAMILTON,"This woman is such a nosey landlord. She lives in a unit on the top floor of the house upstairs, that was not disclosed at the time the agreement was signed. She requires a security deposit in addition to first and last months rent, which isn't even legal. No Laundry, No AC, No parking essentially. The heat is controlled by her and it's always WAY too hot. Zero privacy."
1764,STEVEN SAM,TORONTO,"When comes yard cleaning they expect tenants to do it. They fail to remove snow from parking lot, barely salt,  comes to repair anything to cheap to hire the right people for the job"
1765,ACCOMMOD8U,WATERLOO,"Anyone who has lived as a student in Waterloo is likely aware of the atrocious reputation of Accommod8u, but it bears repeating. To outline what occurred when we moved in to 228 Albert St would be egregiously long, but here are some highlights: the line to get our keys at the office took over 7 hours, our unit was never inspected or cleaned upon entry (stayed with friends or family for a few days to wait for them to clean it, but they never did), the neighbours down the hall from our unit similarly had a filthy unit which included a litter of dead kittens, the elevator broke with contracted cleaning crew inside that were incredibly overworked and underpaid and we had to call the fire department to get them out (of course no one from Accommod8u answered the phones to help them get out), and none of our communications of our issues with the property or management were ever able to be resolved. Very poorly managed, abysmal treatment of contract staff, and no respect for their tenants."
1766,"G MINDEN HOLDINGS INC, SHAWN MINDEN",HAMILTON,All this company cares about is money. Zero compassion. Sketchy agreement and essentially doesn't answer emails or calls three days a week.
1767,LEVENT SAHIN (LMD PROPERTY HOLDINGS),OTTAWA,"This is a true leech landlord! 

He refused to maintain the building to health and safety standards even after the city's orders. 
He tried to trick us into leaving our lease early so he could raise the rent +$600. 
He illegally renovated (by himself) the other unit in the building from a single dwelling unit into an illegal 8+ person rooming house. The recantations were constant, all hours, and weekends. None of those tenants were on leases and all paid under the table illegally.
Levent was constantly on the property with no notice at all, letting himself into the building and using the backyard from morning until night.  Every single week our entire front yard was FILLED with his garbage. 
He constantly had screaming fights with a friend of his he let move into the building. 

Literally none of our appliances worked (fridge, washer/dryer, dishwasher) and he threatened to call the police on us when we requested repairs saying it ""wasn't his problem"" ""he doesn't understand the rules and we are racist for asking him to learn them""  and ""you're using them wrong"". 
When we reported a leak in our sink he told us we were being dramatic and he wouldn't help us. Then the leak spread through the house, into the downstairs unit, through light fixtures ripping through their ceiling, and into the basement. He then tried to frame us for insurance purposes so he would not be liable. 
When he came to the unit for our insurance information, I asked when he would be coming for repairs...He then called the police on my father an I (the police literally laughed at him and told him he has a legal responsibility to maintain the property.) 

After months of harassment and poor living conditions, we tried to bargain to leave our lease with one month notice but he refused unless we paid him more money. The day before our move out, he broke a window in another unit and tried to frame us for ""throwing a party"" and causing the damage. He called the police on me again when he saw our moving trucks and filmed me an inch from my face aggressively, threatening me again. In the end, the police were involved 3 times because of this unprofessional behaviour.

We are now awaiting a hearing from the LTB for lack of maintenance and harassment aka interfering with our reasonable enjoyment of the unit. 

DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS MAN OR HIS WIFE HILAL!!!!"
1768,EFFORT TRUST - BELGAL ESTATES - IONIC,HAMILTON,"I don't know if this applies to Effort Trust in general or just our building, but the building management and superintendent are very kind, helpful, they take complaints seriously, they treats tenants like family. Repairs are done in a timely manner. Once when I had a phone stolen from the laundry room a few years ago, they were very helpful and supportive. It's also kept very clean."
1769,STERLING KARAMAR,PETERBOROUGH,"Started living here on July 2019 and immediately started to experience problems. They do not maintain the properties, do not maintain thr parking lots. I had several maintenance issues which resulted in an LTB hearing for a T6 in which they were found at fault. I left in October 2021. So many others have problems with this same property manager."
1770,NIPISSING DISTRICT HOUSING CORPORATION,NORTH BAY,Landlord does not abide by their commitment to respect and condones any illegal activities necessary to pay rent.
1771,FRANK VIAU,AZILDA,"Frank and Josee are awesome! Prompt with snow removal, yearly checks to make sure everything is running smoothly and checks smoke alarms. Always a pleasure to deal with."
1772,WILLOWBURG APARTMENTS LTD,KITCHENER,"I lived there for years and getting the superintendents to do ANYTHING was like pulling teeth. My pipes constantly clogged up even though I was careful what I put down them, my bathroom was riddled with black mold and didn't have an exhaust fan, the place was riddled with both cockroaches and stink bugs, and the exhaust for my oven just spit everything back into the apartment and onto the cupboards. The heating, which used water pipes, was inconsistent. The video cameras either don't work or aren't placed well since I both had a bike stolen and my car broken into with zero help from the supers. I also never got my key deposit back because the superintendents ghosted me."
1773,BENTALLGREENOAK,KITCHENER,"Overall nice sized units in there older building properties along York and Mount Hope in Kitchener. However, their unit maintenance ability is abysmal, and there was a huge amount of staff turnover that led to projects being delayed upwards of a year and a half. We did not have working blinds in our unit for the majority of 3-year stay, and there were issues identified at move-in that were simply never resolved (ie, no drawers in linen closet or kitchen pantry). Hydro in the building would be shut off at least a few times a month. 

Most importantly, when I moved out there was very little communication of how to arrange the elevator or when inspection would take place ""because move outs don't usually happen on weekends so there is no staff available to support"" (???). They then overcharged me another month of rent when we already moved out, and it took 3 months to receive my money back after weekly reminders and check-ins. Be mindful of these administration and maintenance issues if you ever wish to rent in one of their Kitchener properties."
1774,ZULICH ENTERPRISES,SUDURY,"I've resided in a Zulich property for 5+ years and have been quite happy with the property and property manager.  Any issues I've had are always responded to in a prompt fashion, repairs are completed when promised. I experienced a major flood from a unit above me during a long weekend - maintenance was quick to come onsite and deal with the issue. Once everything was dried and cleaned up they arranged for professional carpet cleaning and completely tore open the ceilings, let dry for a few days and replaced and even painted the room in my choice of colour (I did have to provide the paint as it was standard apt white). Given the size of my unit, the rent is reasonable; all inclusive and includes 2 parking spots.  If I had any ""complaints"" it would be that the overall property could use an update (e.g.: painting hallways, changing or removing carpeting, allow rental access to storage rooms, exterior window cleaning)."
1775,MARYAM KOOSHA,OAKVILLE,"Does not follow Ontario guidelines and her and her boyfriend abuse their tenants and force them to pay out of pocket for repairs. They do not maintain the home. We lived for two years without a working stove or fridge, the pool was broken, the heater blew up causing a violation from the city, and the landlord blamed us for the leaking sunroof and deteriorating 1950s home. They are not responsible and cheap out so bad their contractors yelled at us tenants for them refusing to pay fair prices for replacement of water heater tank and for new dryer etc. stay far away."
1776,ROSEANNE AND NEIL DELBIANCO,SAULT,"This married couple will rent you a house when your pregnant and have a 3 year old that is in complete mould infestation and refuse to do a single thing about it. My toddler was getting so sick and breaking out in full body rashes along with my infant when he was born and came into this house. They made it impossible to leave and everything in the house especially the basement had to be thrown out because it was either full of mould or stunk like mould. They showed no compassion and made no efforts to resolve the issue. The garage in the back was about to completely collapse and didn’t close properly. There were also rats living in the garage and in the garage !!!! All of our things in the garage was destroyed by rat poop. I later ended up breaking the lease due to domestic issues and filed the proper paperwork to leave the property and the person, Roseanne and Neil were inappropriately harassing me over text accusing me of making it up and minimizing the dangerous situation my kids and I were in. They refused to give me my last months rent back knowing I was going on my own and they said they would have no problem filling the property immediately. They also changed the locks on the door before I was done moving which prevented me from getting my own property. Absolute disgusting individuals. If I didn’t have so much stress already I would’ve taken them to small claims to get my last months rent back and some compensation for everything I had to throw out due to the mould infestation. The house was a previous grow op I found out later and the landlord Neil was in on it along with prostitution rings going on. There was so much drug use in the home that there were tiny blood splatters from needle use on the walls and ceilings. We also regularly had junkies coming to the door asking for dope. Absolutely terrible for people with kids to move into, or anyone at all! NEVER recommend these slum lords !!!!!"
1777,PARSVILLE MANAGEMENT,OSHAWA,Blessed with great landlords!
1778,AGINCOURT COOPERATIVE HOMES INCORPORATED,SCARBOROUGH,People on welfare are evicted with their  babies. Voting block is on subsidy. People claiming to be advocates for pensioners vote for raising da rent every year. There are rats all over and the food bank gives expired food.
1779,STEVE TEGANO,VANIER,Best landlord ever
1780,YI ZHU,OAKVILLE,Avoid this landlord. Rude and disrespectful. He will charge you money by every means.
1781,SLEEPWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,They are very quick to respond to requests. Only complaints is they don’t replace lightbulbs which is their responsibility under the RTA. They also don’t have a super living in the building and it can be hard to get any enforcement on the no smoking rule.
1782,ASCOT CO-OPERATIVE HOMES INC,ETOBICOKE,Experiencing invasion of privacy by managers.
1783,OCASIO DASILVA,OTTAWA,The landlord is old and grumpy and thinks he knows everything. The buildings are mostly filled with ODSP recipients with mental health issues. 
1784,WESTERN UNIVERSITY APARTMENTS,LONDON,"My experience with Will Uhl and Valentina was pretty disrespectful and incompetent, but I can't say it was that bad because it was just typical institutional landlord BS."
1785,MARK STAPLETON,WATERLOO,We recorded him showing up at the house unannounced and with no one home and then entering each bedroom. He never told us he did that nor did he find out we had the video. He then threatened to take us to court over so many small issues and eventually gave us a $1300 cleaning bill after we paid for professional cleaners anyway. Worst landlord I have had out of 4 and should be banned from renting to students
1786,DUBRICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"I was harassed by Pam, who manages several properties in Kitchener-Waterloo. When my roommate moved out and gave notice Pam entered my suite while I was not home and called me a hoarder for not taking out my recycling. I asked for my doorbell to be repaired after living in the unit for a year, and was told ""It was broken when you moved in"" and nothing was done to fix it. When I complained about the tenant chain smoking in the unit below me, making it difficult for me to breathe, I was given a scented candle. When my hot water tank broke it took 7 daily visits from Dubrick's repair tech to fix it, and I was without hot water for that entire time. When I moved out myself a neighbour recorded me taking my couch to the curb (for bulk garbage pickup) and emailed it to Pam who then called me and threatened me with calling by-law. 

In general, any time I had to deal with Pam to resolve issues she was rude, hostile, and abrasive. I would not recommend her, or Dubrick PM to anyone."
1787,25 MABELLE NORTH EDGE,ETOBICOKE,Management hides behind locked doors. Never answers phone calls. Never replies emails. Any requests has to go through security. Tenants with medical issues and doctors note were forced into B3 level where they have to take stairs. There are moulds and bathroom exhaust fans doesn’t work. Maintenance say it’s an old system and can’t be repaired. Nothing get fixed but rent increases almost double the allowance.  There are mice and roaches.
1788,MANO ANASTASAKIS,HAMILTON,Best landlord I've ever had. Quickly dealt with repairs. Easy to get a hold of.
1789,PING FENG,OTTAWA,Ping and his wife are absolutely wonderful landlords and people. They were very responsible and fair. They even left a little Christmas gift in my vestibule the year I was with them. 10/10 would recommend them and their rental property to anyone!
1790,BRADWICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH BAY,"Only care about the profit they make from their tenants. Reported carpeting that was so worn it was slippery in the stairs and myself and my children had fallen several times, repair person that came to check it out told me “they won’t do anything about that”. Basement was musty and smelled bad, had to run a dehumidifier 24/7 and emptied it daily."
1791,CINDY TRAN,KING CITY,"Property was kept in very good condition. Main challenge is that the landlady has little respect for tenants. She tried to limit how many guests we were allowed and threatened a fraudulent eviction if we continued to have people over. On several occasions she or her agent entered our unit without notice or our awareness. In the end we were served an eviction notice for personal use. While we were in the process of moving out and still renting the space she entered our unit without our consent or awareness and moved in her possessions.  Additionally, she sent us an extremely unreasonable list of damages and costs to the unit that we are in the process of disputing."
1792,APARTMENT SHOPPE,LONDON,Cockroach hotels.   Mice run rampant.   I have killed over 40 mice myself in the 2 years there.
1793,BARBIR SIDHU THE OWNER,MISSISSAUGA,"The building  was unkept by building owners and landlord ANNA  hundreds of people and children no lost their  homes due to a flooding that was caused by the landlords and the cheap  building owners BARBIR SIDHU they refused to pay for real contractors. They got two tenants and the maintenance man who are not contractors to fix the roof because it was the cheap way. Despite thunder & rain storm warnings days before the floor happened, They decided to open a huge HOLE while on the roof, and placing a cardboard cover on top of the hole thinking it was a job well done!! They were NOT professionals !!! Now this resulted in people losing their only homes!!! It was on the news search up roche court floodings on Google this happened in 2021. they also have rats in the basement and homes are infested with cockroaches and ants and BLACK MOLD that they refuse to repair."
1794,MIKE - 425 PRINCESS AVENUE,LONDON,"The property in question is designated a Class 1 heritage property -- I looked it up when we first moved in, so excited to be in a historic house! -- and he is letting it go to pieces. Parts of it are literally rotting. He won't get anything fixed. There are multiple serious issues with apartments on the property that make it unsafe, which he has ignored for years. When he does have something fixed, it's usually a stopgap. (Check out the pillar holding up the east balcony, you'll see what I mean.) Approaching the city will get you the minimum possible response if you're lucky. I believe he relies on tenants with low, fixed, and/or unstable incomes who can't afford anywhere else."
1795,ERIN K WEILER,ETOBICOKE,"I lived in the house as a shared tenant for 5 years. Did everything by the book, paid rent on time (some time even a week in advance), communicated well, even during pandemic. After 3 years landlady/ ""roommate"" who did not even live in Canada, decides to raise rent above the state percentage claiming utilities have gone up, etc. and cos she dint raise rent first two years cos of pandemic. I paid for the 3rd year, and 4th year to avoid conflict. Over the 5 years, whenever she came to town twice a year and stayed for 4-5 days, i had to sleep at a friend's place even though i paid rent, cos i could not switch on AC (Jul) and heater (Dec). She asked me to get a personal space heater, so i had to invest in one even though the apartment had heating and cooling included. She would use my utilities and leave the house a mess for me to clean asking me if i had a vacuum, as if i was her servant. I even had to pay cleaners to come in to do a deep clean in 2020/ 2021 during pandemic cos she would not maintain anything in the house cos she was not in town and all the previous tenants leftovers were everywhere. I did not know this at the time and assumed everything was hers. The whole responsibility was on me, even picking up her mail. 

In the fifth year she decides to raise rent again by a ridiculous amount, and i told her i'll confirm. Sent her the rent as usual and 3-4 weeks later before the next increased rent was due, she lands in Toronto from LA, whi8le i was at work and breaks into the house without giving me any verbal or written notice, takes off safety locks and asks me to leave the premise on the false note that i had not called her or picked her call. Staging it as an emergency and using the loophole in the system. 

The house has not undergone maintenance in the 5 years that i had been there, except for AC filter changes. Even when the microwave broke down(4th year), had to plead her to get it fixed. The bathroom shower handle leaked and broke due to no maintenance, which even the plumber noted on his visit after much pleading. In spite of having kept the place immaculate in the 5 years, the day she broke in she said the place was a mess, that she felt threatened by me and that she wanted me out in 2 days. All this and she is the one with the locks on her room door. She threw out all my food in the garbage and thrashed all my things. She then argued and fought with my guarantor who also owns and apartment in the same condo.

There was also a time when i had my guarantor over at my place at one of the times she was in town. She brings out a Swiss army knife and shows it off to me and my friends, almost like a threat. Which we at the time thought was very odd, but continued to disregard cos she was never around for too long. She also claims to be a lawyer, but is no longer a practising one in Canada or the US.

It was unfortunate that i don't have the money to hire a lawyer to serve her, so i had to bite the bullet and move on. After much contemplation i also realized alot of red flags and that this was not her first time. She had fed me and my guarantor a sob story on the day i moved in that, her sister was the last person to live there and that her sister up and left without giving her any notice. I cannot help but think it was another poor soul like me who she manipulated and did not give deposits back and ate the last months rent from too.

Anybody renting from her in the future, please be aware and warned. She is very volatile and unpredictable. Im glad i never stayed aro0und while she was there cos i dint know if she would have poisoned my food or went through my personal things."
1796,MEDALLION CORPORATION,NORTH YORK,"Medallion Corporation is in the wrong business, just like good tenants pay the rent always on time & and respect the property that is being rented. Medallion Corporation responses to any  repairs, safety of there tenants and maintenance of the building is unacceptable and should be fined and held accountable to the highest court."
1797,RGL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,NORTH BAY,"Fairly decent property management but they don’t do anything unless you complain  - moved in to my unit and a lot of things were broken that should have been fixed before I got in. Lived in an old building, poorly insulated and loud as sound travels through all units and you can hear nearly everything from your neighbours. Ant and bug problems. Rent is super high, they seem more interested in their profit than the tenant, like most these days"
1798,GWL RA RESIDENTIAL,OTTAWA,"As soon as they purchased the buildings, everything fell apart. It takes forever for any repairs, garbage all over the property, infestations non-stop. Cars have been repeatedly broken into because the garage doors keep breaking and an entire car was stolen and they offered no help or camera viewing."
1799,DEVI ODISHO,HAMILTON,Awful landlord. Does not care about repairing things in the apartment. We were without heat for the majority of the winter and Devi would only get repair techs to do the bare minimum which never lasted more than a few days. He did provide us with space heaters but having two plugged in would blow the breaker which took days to fix. We also didn’t have adequate a/c during the summer. Among many other repairs that he failed to have fixed.
1800,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER-WATERLOO,They are the worst. Thankfully I'm no longer renting from them. If you do please don't expect them to answer the phone or their emails. They will not repair anything in a timely manner. I will never be involved with one of their rentals again. They are unkind ans uncaring.
1801,DIAMOND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TIMMINS,Diamond property management has been great to me!
1802,THE YU’S,TORONTO,"The fridge was broken for 8 months. When finally replaced, it was a cheap half-sized fridge. They wanted to increase the rent more than the authorized amount with less than the mandated notice."
1803,GREG SHANNON,PETAWAWA,"Do not rent from. Myself and several other previous tenants have had to get the OPP involved to protect ourselves. The OPP in the area know him by name and have warned him multiple times. Stay away, as he is extremely harassing, invasive, and disrespectful."
1804,STEPHEN WHITE,HAMILTON,"Stephen is a very nice landlord, very laid back and happy going. However is very slow when it comes to communication. I’ve had to communicate issues multiple times before even receiving a response."
1805,EMPIRE LIVING CENTRE,NORTH BAY,"Caught nursing staff in multiple errors that they would take zero accountability for. emails to GM about wandering tenants to my loved one’s door went ignored or they suggested signage despite me identifying signage that was in place for months and it being a staff issue. Multiple requests for assistance went ignored as well. Was told once “if you don’t like it, they can live somewhere else” when asked if they would take any accountability for their actions. Meal servings are very small, my loved one lost a lot of weight while on their meal service. To pay over $4000/month and have this level of “care” was frightening to watch."
1806,MANO ANASTASAKIS,TORONTO @HAMILTON,"This guy's a joke. I had water leaking into my downstairs for a year, mold, and he never did anything about it. He threatened me , and refused any attempt to remedy anything he owns numerous property's, and hides behind his worker "
1807,GREENWIN,TORONTO,"Horrible. I have lived in my unit for 5 years and the building is run down and sloppy. Management has no sensitivity training and absolutely zero compassion if you fall on hard times. We are in a recession and inflation is only rising, yet they’ve still found a way to increase rent on 3 separate occasions during these times. Also, when you call the management office they hardly answer, but know how to ring down your phone when they need to reach you. They also raise rent without leaving proper notices and threaten to take you to court if you miss 1 payment. I have lived in other buildings with different landlords that actually treated me like a person. Greenwin drops the ball every time. They also have horrible security guards that are just as bad and insensitive as the management office team."
1808,YONGMEI OU,MARKHAM,"My landlord owns multiple properties which I am happy that she is successful.  One concern, she does not want to work and claims she has a concussion but plays sports 9 hours a day. She expects tenants to just pay more because she does not want to work.  I feel exploited as a tenant when she forced me to pay $350 per month more so I can have a one year lease.  She also very dishonest and claims that I missed a payment. She spent hours messaging me even after I provided the proof and message showing where she says she received it.  She also tries to befriend my children and myself to find out about our finances and items in the house. This is for all. Be careful"
1809,GREENWIN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC.,SCARBOROUGH,"I love my superintendent but this company sucks. They are just another large corporation trying to squeeze every dollar from their tenants while.putting the bare minimum back into the properties. The appliances are old, many units have cockroach infestations, many units have not been updated in over 20 years. The brick facade on the outside of the building is chipping and falling to the ground below, there is little visitor parking and no overnight visitor parking there are only 3 old washer and dryers for an entire building over 120 units. There used to be extra storage lockers in the basement, but the corp decided it better to turn the basement storage place into a new tiny unit - Wonderful idea right? When the units are ""fixed up"" before being given to the next renter very little is done other than making sure to paint over everything including dead bugs and garbage left in the deteriorating cupboards."
1810,MEGAN PROPERTIES MANAGEMENT INC.,HAMILTON,"The company that manages the building does not do any repairs, does not maintain the plumbing ,and refuses to turn up heat in the winter, last winter the temperature in the apartment was 72 degrees."
1811,DELIA YI WANG,TORONTO,"My experience living at Delia’s property wasn’t great. She will respond to your questions about maintenance, pest control (yes there were mice in the property), temperature (you don’t have access to the thermostats) but she will not tell you when the problem would be fixed. You have to follow up with her again and again and her attitude is not great. If you want easy communication and mutual respect, you don’t want to live at her property."
1812,BAYSHORE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,ORILLIA,"This 37 unit building had 10 apartments treated for bedbugs in the first 8 months I lived here. 
The first time I reported bedbugs in my unit Bayshore took over a month to respond and insinuated that IF I did have them I must have brought them in. The bedbug problem continues in this building. It has cost me in laundry money and requires me to live for 21 days (between sprays) with all my clothing and belonging tied up in trash bags. I’m hopeful that the new exterminator company they are using AND the diligence of the new Superintendent will begin to get this under control. I’ve been pushing despite being concerned about been marked as a trouble maker for not accepting this as status quo.  
Bayshore has not yet completed the minor repairs they agreed to have done BEFORE I took occupancy. I’ve been here over a year now. Also still waiting for the agreed upon window screens. I don’t want another spring/summer without being able to open my windows. 
This is subsidized housing and I feel we are disrespected neglected and discriminated against because of our poverty. Thank you for a safe space to express this. I need this subsidy. Wish I had COHB instead."
1813,CHI SUITES,OTTAWA,"STUDENTS BEWARE>  
From 2001 to 2002
Beware of renting any apartment from Chi suites, Ottawa student residence, Golden Dragon Inc. Chi van ho. This landlord is greedy slum bag, the apartments have major water damage, mold, mice infestation, roaches. Buildings are dirty, some tenants are either partying all hours or domestics! water damage and floods everywhere in your apartment. only way to get repairs is by calling bylaw. He doesn't pay his bills so hot water and heat get disconnected. If your rent is late by one day, he's pounding on your door at 10pm. His staff are rude and act like your an inconvenience if you complain about a problem. He rents apartments out as 4 and 5 bedroom but rooms are in the basement and there's no fire escape!!!! The new upgrade units are purely cosmetic, building is a zombie. Save yourself the hassle and find some place else to rent, even if it's a little more money your better off."
1814,STERLING KARAMAR,LONDON,"Greedy company running the buildings on Mornington Ave. They put in less than the bare minimum when it comes to property maintenance and repairs. They'll send you a rental increase the first day it's eligible, and turn around and take weeks to fix the broken elevator. Laundry machines are never cleaned and don't work properly. Pests abound on the ground floor. The entire outside of the properties is disgusting with garbage everywhere. The neighborhood isn't nice to begin with, lots of homeless going through the garage bins outside. Rent isn't even that cheap compared to other locations. Avoid this place at all costs!"
1815,LIANGYU LI,TORONTO,"Rent was cheaper than most places in Toronto however the place was horribly taken care of. If there were any repairs needed to be done it was impossible to get hold of him as he would not respond to email or texts. He also refused to pay for repairs. For instance when a window and laundry machine needed to be repaired (not by our doing) we had to pay for both out of pocket and were too worried about him trying to evict us to file with the LTB. When we did speak to him he was rude, demanded respect for his authority as a landlord but treated us like children rather than tenants. When we finally moved he did not even have the decency of responding to emails or texts about returning the keys. The day we moved we just left them in the mailbox. Wouldn't recommend renting from him even though rent is lower than average."
1816,RHUIZHEN CHEN,TORONTO,"Typical toronto landlord, doesn't do repairs, doesn't replace broken things, doesn't have a garbage service??? but cheap rent so you get what you pay for"
1817,MINTO GROUP,OTTAWA,"Disgusting. Overpriced, bedbug and roach INFESTED. The washers & dryers FILLED with bedbugs. People smoke inside. Nasty."
1818,DREWLO,LONDON,"The Drewlo property is really the best, don’t miss this property if one is available but the property manager Joan at 1440 Beaverbrook is the worst manager you could ask for. She is rude and a lazy person, she doesn’t pick up calls, even if she did, would say will look into it but never comes. The hack for her management issue that we tenant use is call on Thursday, she is off so the nearby building manager would attend immediately to your concern."
1819,CAPREIT,TORONTO,Complete lack of professionalism. Complete nepotism in the office. Total disregard for tenants. Cleanliness sub par. Security of complex - LACKING.
1820,CHAMOUN YACOUB,AJAX,"My landlord constantly harassed me to move out for 8 years because we weren't paying the kind of rent he wanted. He doesn't know the law at all. Never even tried to legally raise the rent. Ruined our enjoyment of living. Never did anything that needed to be done while we lived here. Fire department had to take care of smoke detectors because he failed to do so.
I believe landlords should take a course to learn the rules and regulations before becoming a landlord and not knowing the system and just being greedy."
1821,OLD OAK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"Stay far away from the Old Oak Properties Royal Oaks Terrace properties. 

Buildings are falling apart from water damage, pest issues, zero communication with staff, heating issues,  and much more. If you value your friends and family, you will not allow them to move  them into the units. I heard Forest Hills is just as bad sadly."
1822,GREENROCK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,Not as nice as they claim to be.
1823,CAROL MCKEEN,KINGSTON,"An absolutely nightmare of a landlord. Went out of her way to make our life difficult. Rent is cheaper than most, but would still recommend looking elsewhere if trying to find Kingston student housing."
1824,NORTH WOOD TERRACE/ GRAYDON HALL APARTMENTS,NORTH YORK,"Large, bright, 1940s apartments low rise 4-5 apartments in each building. laundry rooms in ever other building usually shared between 10-20 apartment depending on if machines are broken which usually they were (no laundry mats near by) . lived there for 7 years. It was great until a random rat infestation came out of nowhere when the original owner passed and his family took over. Location was amazing, rent prices were reasonable but dealing with the new owners was a nightmare. Rats were everywhere, even in the stove, never had any of these issues for 6 years then all of a sudden it was so unmanageable and the management was doing nothing to fix the problems; no property maintenance (snow wasn’t being shovelled, walk ways weren’t being salted, leaves weren’t being cleaned, hallways weren’t be swept/vacuumed or mopped so the smells of the rats plus no regular maintenance was beyond disgusting. went to L and T board started the proceedings but unfortunately covid happened and didn’t allow us to finish the court proceedings. I had just given up because the living conditions were inhumane and I decided to move out for my mental health. Due to covid never finished the processings. The management is brutal they were able to remove all the google reviews by deleting the google map marking so unfortunately you can’t see all the reviews other tenants had made. Best of luck dealing with Graydonhall apartments (GHcapital)"
1825,MARION LAUDANO,NEW HAMBURG,Building is not up to fire code. Complaints go unanswered or told to suck it up because no one had complained about said thing(s) before. Is a non smoking building which other tenants still smoke in and landlord does nothing about it.
1826,ADENA HOLDINGS INC,WOODSTOCK,"Do not rent here. The building is infested with earwigs and the bathroom has no fan or proper ventilation, so the ceiling is mouldy (and that's your problem apparently). The property managers aren't that bad to deal with, it's the superintendents that are the problem. They lack respect and basic knowledge about rental rights. My privacy was constantly invaded to the point where I felt uncomfortable leaving my apartment and there were countless times they broke landlord rules. 
The building is also poorly maintained. It reeks like cigarettes in the hallway and the spider webs are endless. They make small (landlord-special) upgrades, but you lose a privilege every time. For example, when they redid the parking lot they took away all visitor parking. The building is loud and not a great spot for middle-aged working professionals and the building security is lacking. There is an issue with people breaking in and taking Amazon packages (a step in the right direction would be moving the superintendents to the first floor to monitor who's coming and going). Overall, I would compare my experience here similar to living in a college residence lol. You have someone up in your business constantly, so many rules (dogs can't make a peep, but kids can slam on doors and scream in the hallways all day) and you're paying 2023 rent living in 1990s decor."
1827,Uzma and Sajid,SCARBOROUGH,Wonderful family Uzma and Sajid go.out of there way to help. They never interfere and treat us with respect and humanity. I love this family the make yiu feel like family.
1828,LINDSAY REID,LONDON,Best landlord I have ever had.   She is so personable and can call her any time of the day with any issues.
1829,SCOTT BINKLEY,NORTH BAY,"The best and most honest landlord I have ever dealt. We have lived in our home for over 7 years now,   and he hasn't jumped on the greedy band wagon like the rest of North Bay,  even his other property is listed at an affordable price.    He asked us to treat our place like it is our home,  and we have!   If we have the rare property issue that we can't deal with our self,  he is quick to respond.   He is very personable and respectful.  But remember respect works both ways!   And for all these years we have never had an issue.  Thank you Scott for being such an honest and wonderful landlord!"
1830,SANJAY CHITAPAIN,HAMILTON,Good privacy and somewhat timely repairs. Did not care for property and would ask us to take care of it under threat of fine from the city
1831,ROSSITZA KRASTEVA,LONDON,I moved in my main floor unit 5yrs ago and I didn't know I was renting an illegal unit until a few weeks ago now it is a rooming house and the locks will come off my slider door that separates us from the basement and the men in the basement can come up here. I have minor children and baby grand children and I don't have locks on our bedrooms or bathrooms because I didn't rent it as a rooming house. Instead of the LL fixing the issue and paying for it to be legal she is evicting us. She has got physical with me and harasses me.
1832,PAUL & DESRINE SMITH 4FAMILIESHM,"LONDON , BRAMPTOM","They only fix things that save them $ like a water leak, all other issues are ignored until bilaw fourced them to fix. They will call and harass tenannants, send rude emails and ask to resign leases to avoid rent caps, will alter dates on forms served (n1) to benifit them, will use n5 when no infractions are made."
1833,EFFORT TRUST (WESTMOUNT TOWER),HAMILTON,"Very by the book and official with notices, repairs, entry and pest control"
1834,CORGIR REAL ESTATE,OSHAWA,"This Company cares about looks, not safety. This Building lacks basic safety needs, like emergency lighting in stairwells (7 floors), the elevator works when it wants, no access to the underground parking if Elevator is down. The filth of the building is horrible. The landlords have only, their son to clean the 7 storey building. The maintenance is not kept up. Landlord will just walk into your apartment as well. If something needs to be fixed, your better to do it yourself. I had to have my cupboards fixed, would not close, they just came in shaved off the wood, left a mess and didn't even repaint the cupboard. The ant problem is horrible, caused by a tree leaning on the building, they refuse to cut it down. Inside wall by entrance, is a huge Ant farm.   Do you research before you rent with them, they look after multiple properties in Oshawa."
1835,THE MANNS,MALLORYTOWN,"Horrible people to rent from. Mr T Mann is not factored into this review as he stays out of most dealings and I respect him as a person. Mrs Mann and the delinquent adult daughter meddled in my family’s business at a time our family was dealing with someone unimaginable to so many others. The mother and daughter wheesled their way into my family and brainwashed my husband at a time when he was rock bottom, as I’d been taken from my family. The daughter and him ended up having an affair because she would not leave him alone, encouraged him to abandon me where I was. She lied and stole from us and put my children in the midst of her scheme. They manipulated him and he felt pressured that if he did not go along with what she desired that they would use the house against him, which is ultimately what happened when I arrived back home sooner than uplanned. These people are very well known in the community and are known crap disturbers that make peoples lives hell. Well karma has a funny way of working out because the daughter was recently on ctv news with many criminal charges related to drugs, weapons and proceeds of crime. No shock to my family and it was the closure needed."
1836,AUGER PROPERTIES,HAMILTON,Performed many inspections and would give write ups for things such as some dishes being left in the sink
1837,MAINSTREAM,ST. CATHARINES,Thy dont respect your rights. Thy say its there way or the highway.
1838,HIGH VALUE CONSULTANTS LTD,TORONTO,M
1839,Q RESIDENTIAL,OSHAWA,"Repair request seem to just disappear and things linger for weeks before anything is done.  Major repairs seemed to be ignored.  The repair contractors are usually very incompetent and leave a mess instead of cleaning up.   They have implemented paid parking by a company from Toronto yet I was told that some residents had been ticked without warning for parking in their own paid for parking spaces??
The winter snow plowing has deteriorated from year to year, the last big snow storm took almost 3 days to clear some of the driveways.  The mounds of snow are left blocking driveways and garages.   There is a area that is used as a community dump, the neighboring community just freely brings their garbage and dumps it and leaves a mess which attracts rodents and coyotes.  The garbage gets pushed to the back of the compound daily but by 7 pm mounds of trash has been dumped by the gate.  Garbage from the ripped open bags gets blown down the street and the Hydro right of way where it is located."
1840,BEDFORD PROPERTIES (MARK KNODDEL),OSHAWA,ALL THEY DO IS RENOVICT AND DISREGARD RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. TOTAL SCUM OF THE EARTH
1841,VISION PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BRANTFORD,Worst landlord ever
1842,DEL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT (EDGE ON TRIANGLE PARK),TORONTO,Illegally locked out as a tenant by the property management
1843,YWCA,TORONTO,"People die here needlessly and it gets hidden. Fires happen and they don't hit the news. Security is not up to par and things get stolen all the time. It is like living in a shelter. Whenever anyone complains they get the ""you aren't going to find anywhere cheaper"" response. They know we're trapped here."
1844,JOEL STAPLEY,ST. CATHARINES,Good landlord. Always 1/2 ass diy repairs and then tells you how much he saved or how much it cost when a pro was needed.
1845,HRS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,Does the bare minimum to not receive a 1 or 2 rating. Their rent rates are absolutely disgusting and predatory on students in the area.
1846,TIM & ROSR LATTANZI,ROSE,They were great landlords. Very respectful and attentive when something needed to be repaired. Had to sell the residence and gave me more than adequate notice. Rose tried to take more money than was owed at the end but was quickly reminded of the rules.
1847,GRENALIN PROPERTIES LTD.,MARKHAM,Poor management.
1848,AHMED,WATERLOO,Worst landlord
1849,RAJA SANGANA,OSHAWA,"This landlord was awful. She continuously texted to complain about her financial situation to try and make the tenants feel sorry for her. Her mortgage increased due to BoC interest hikes that she assumed would be covered by the tenants. The small bungalow was full of mold and appliances were broken. The furnance/air conditioning broke down and this was also the tenants responsibility to repair. She continuously threatened to evict so she could move back in though she had no intentions. She is charging over $3,500/month plus utilities for an 1100 square foot bungalow in a crappy area. 
Just one of the many who thought rental income was a passive form of income without educating herself with the Landlord/Tenant Act. Do not rent from her!"
1850,URBANDALE CORPORARION,OTTAWA,"Urbandale only makes surface repairs and takes months to respond to complaints. Any improvements to building are purely aesthetic. They put all new fancy tile in laundry rooms but put in even older and smaller washing machines, recarpeted hallways but won't clean up garbage and litter on property outdoors. They use surface upgrades that no one asked for or wanted as an excuse to try and boost rent prices. Staff constantly talk sh** about any tenants that ask for help."
1851,Q RESIDENTIALS,SCARBOROUGH,"For Tower 1. 215 Markham road... too much noise ... some people put loud noise at night and there is one car in the parking lot, two ladies always smoking there with some instruments... very bad smell... last week I noticed big smoke coming from floor 2( they did some cultural thing) then suspect they off the fire alarm"
1852,GOLD LEAF ENTERPRISE,WATFORD,Joanne Van Bree is a great landlord and we would recommend her to anyone!
1853,DAN DIMOVSKI/ JOLANTA PAKULA,WINDSOR,"Terrible Landlord. The place is full of cockroaches, mice and mold. Repairs are done poorly, improperly and with dollar store materials. Cleaning of the common areas/snow removal never done. Landlord and property manager are both very disrespectful and make tennancy uncomfortable. Landlord banks on you not knowing your rights. Landlord doesn't show up on time and sometimes not at all when you have an appointment. Avoid."
1854,KATHY & STACEY,ACTON,"I have lived with these people in Acton for exactly 5 months. They are control freaks, and they have created an apartment without a permit in my opinion. My bedroom was next to the septic tank and it was very unpleasant. Because of this experience, I don’t even want to visit Acton ever again. Most depressing winter of my life and I’m 42."
1855,Q RESIDENTIALS,SCARBOROUGH,no repaire and pest control
1856,Q RESIDENTIALS,SCARBOROUGH,When we request for any repairs they don't mind it. The management staff in Q Tower 2 is rude and the white lady she pretending she offering something free. Very bad people. But I heard the Tower 1 people are very nice
1857,(SANDY) SHUFANG WU,KITCHENER,"Background: Sandy is an investor from Toronto who only ever stepped foot in the unit once in her entire life, which was to hand the keys over when showing the unit on move-in day. 

Sandy was polite, but had zero idea how renting worked. (Having tried to raise the rent illegally twice by demanding over the legally allowed amount) There were a couple of maintence issues that were brought to her attention, but only half were actually addressed as she had to be reminded multiple times, and followup did not always have an issue resolved. Property maintence was done by the building's property management company, with no issue. (Who ended up resolving most of the minor repair issues)"
1858,CODY TROTMAN,GLENCOE,"Awesome landlord, was very respectful and always addressed any concerns. There was very few concerns as he kept his rental property in excellent shape."
1859,EDITH KRONER,CAMBRIDGE,"One day when I came home I smelled smoke like something electrical was on fire. After looking around we seen smoke coming out of the windows in the apartment below us. I knocked on doors telling people to get out. Nobody wanted to call 911 which confused me. I called 911. By the time they got there...Edith's spy tenant had called her and had her on the phone telling her about the situation. She instructed the firemen to not knock the door down that it would be too expensive to repair!!! At that point another tenant said she had the spare key for that apartment as it was her friend's unit. They both lived alone and thought it be a good idea for each other to have the spare key. The door got unlocked and it turned out that the lady left a burner on and a dish towel was laying near by and started smoking. Once the situation was resolved, the landlord gave the tenant grief for #1 giving a spare key to her friend in the same building. #2 for having the accident with the stove and #3 to me for calling 911!!! She evicted the tenant who lived there longer than we did!! She has no regard for anyone but herself!!!"
1860,DAVID BAIROS,TORONTO,"Great Landlord, only ctc is when we needed 
Prompt and hired someone right away if needed."
1861,SHAHANA (METCAP),SCARBOROUGH,"Moved into this apartment and didn’t have a working shower for 2 months. Completely infested with roaches- you will have to fumigate your own apartment because management will not care. The place is disgusting, kids screaming, running through the halls, 3 elevators and you’re lucky if ONE works. Head of maintenance is incompetent and shameless about the poor state of the apartment. Parking garage smells like urine and cigarettes. Only benefit is the low rent but be prepared to deal directly with the property manager (and go over the heads of the main office) because the management office will not address any of your concerns/maintenance requests in a timely manner! I’ve had the head of maintenance basically try to just walk into my apartment once so installing a security camera in your unit is a must! Good luck LOL!"
1862,MICHAEL CAMASTRA,TORONTO,"I’ve been a tenant of Michael’s for nearly 9 years and have nothing but great things to say. He’s always quick on repairs, abides by the RTA, and was incredibly kind and accommodating when I hit a financial rough patch and had to put a rent payment plan in place.
He also lives on-site (which I know lots of people seem to hate) but I’ve never received any sort of complaint from him regarding noise or anything. Plus it means he’s super accessible should there be an emergency!"
1863,RANEE MANAGEMENT,NORTH YORK,Our building is run by Alex and Rosa they are a great couple! Anytime I call or fill out form for request it's done immediately unless they have to order a part. The building is clean and mostly bug free (occasional roach in laundry room) The only complain I have is about the POOL. It hasn't been cleaned or opened since 2019 and there are plants now growing on the pool cover cause of all the water accumulated over the years! It is disgusting to look at and attracts mosquitoes and its horrible to look at.
1864,JOYU WANG,TORONTO,increase rent illegally or try to evict u with n12 and no 1 month rebate
1865,RODNEY & RYAN FLETCHER 15 MORRIS IN GUELPH,GUELPH,"These 2 are absolutely the worst landlords I've EVER had. I've been assaulted by both of them. They illegally enter my unit over 2 dozen times. Their is a bug infestation, the apartment has no AC but they say it does. Ryan the son is a creep he keeps a log book of people's comings and goings. He has a cellphone camera in the window to keep tabs on me, when I go out and come home. It's so embarrassing that I never have any guests over. Also I'm pretty sure he's a pedophile as he told me he'd like to get into the neighbors 16 year old pants. They are absolutely the most disgusting vile ppl I've ever met. Only good thing is the rent is 1100 all in but they cut off my wifi and cable about 6 months in to make more mon3y because their both poor."
1866,TERRI FRANK (QUEEN WEST RENTALS),TORONTO,"Terri is the best landlord I've ever experienced in Toronto. She is attentive, thoughtful, kind and just. She is fair to her tenants, makes sure to always ask permission to enter a unit with much advance notice, plans for repairs in a timely and consideration fashion, is friendly and kind. She has even brought me replacement light bulbs in the past! She is quick to respond to inquiries or needs, and always checks in with her tenants for opportunities to take over other units she has available. She's incredibly helpful, she's a great neighbour, and is always thinking of the community as a whole. She's been nothing but fantastic to me for the last 7 years and I've lived in two of her buildings."
1867,AG SECURE PROPERTIES,ORILLIA,"They want everything SIN/DL/Credit check/Employment references/current pay stubs/Explanation for bankruptcies + 
Absolutely ridiculous I'm not buying the home just renting for a year term ... our application was denied stating a reason would not b provided!
They just currently took over my new residence as of May 1st"
1868,SUD GROUP (ELLIOT SUD),TORONTO,"Sud Group are the type of landlords who come in to fix one thing and break another three in the process. In 2017 they engaged in renovictions, and harassed tenants heavily, giving eviction notices back as almost every response to a repair request. A neighbour told me they withheld her mail until she agreed to leave because she wasn't listed as the main occupant on the lease. 

They also have lied to the fire department about the state of the fire alarms in the building, they told them they had fixed the fire alarm pull systems, when they hadn't. So for three years in a row we didn't have working fire alarms in our building with 110 year old electrical in it. This LL wants to demolish and develop every beautiful old building he touches, beware."
1869,HILLBURN APARTMENTS,TORONTO,"I'm a current long-term tenant.  Very few issues to complain about.  Good communication about building repairs or if they need to enter your apartment for repairs or inspections. The building itself is kept in good repair with regular maintenance as needed. 
There have been a couple not-so-great superintendents, but those ones don't last long.
The laundry room could use better and more frequent cleaning attention.  Otherwise a decent place to live."
1870,WHITE WATER INVESTMENTS LYN VINCENT LABEAU PROPERT MANAGER TABBY BASSANI,TIMMINS ONTARIO,"is owned by white water investments property manager tabby they do not do repairs at all they buy buildings and let them go till they are run down i lived in there property for 2 years and before that rented a place with them they have mold in bathroom and where ever else leaks in the bathroom and water comes down from top floor in to living room and the sewer when wash clothes smells like poo all the time through the sink been reported by many tenants but nothings has been done  they  say city is  on her but nothing done the house at this time fell  due to the water and right in to  basement apartment tenant  had to move furniture out of bedroom due to ceiling fell  that,s pretty much all properties the property manager likes to cause trouble for the tenant  and bullies them and threatens them she is controlling and miserable to the tenants  and will forge new leases with your names on it  and the owner backs all of what she does wanted them to fix the leak they gave us notice property  to move in 2 weeks but the landlord will deny any wrong doings and former worker next door backs them to and property manager will trash you to other people i have lost all  of furniture with them and equipment i rented 20 father and the ceiling collapsed on me and my husband in 2017  and tabby rented to a native person who collected furniture off the street and we ended up with bed bugs for 2 years down in the basement pipes busted down there to electricity was sparking around my washer and dryer when they patch if they do after u move they put tape over the hole and paint over it and all they ever say is not my problem to the tenant even tried to take my yard from us and lynn will just say what the people want to hear and never do anything just collect money that,s  it something has to be done about white water investments i believe they have to be one of the worst landlords i have ever seen i hope something is done about them at some point"
1871,HAZELVIEW 50 MOOREGATE,KITCHENER,They have a great maintenance guy there. And the office staff is really nice.
1872,FAST,OTTAWA,The best landlord I have ever had. 10 out of 10
1873,VENKATISH,TORONTO,"Our owner is one of best landlords I have encountered, he is not annoying and always there to slove the probs"
1874,DAVID & PAMELA TAYLOR,STOUFFVILLE,"Landlords live on property and have no comprehension of rules and responsibilities as laid out in the Act.

Avoid at all costs.  They will N12 you as soon as you have a complaint."
1875,GEORGE PAPADAS,OTTAWA,Terrible sketchy landlord. Stay away.
1876,MELITA CULL,HAMILTON,"This LL owns multiple properties does not maintain her homes flooding basements, shows up without notice , waters home with keys without knocking harasses and  attacks tenants and uses the n12 process to evict tenants when things go down hill, literally baracaded herself outside the home, tried to enter and change the locks had to call police and paralegal to show up.  And stop her, ended up moving because of this and now can barely afford the housing as a result DO NOT RENT FROM HER!! Ps i wish there was a way to connect with other tenants of hers"
1877,CAPREIT,TORONTO,Property Management ignores leash bylaw infractions and related complaints
1878,RODNEY & RYAN FLETCHER 15 MORRIS IN GUELPH,GUELPH,"These 2 are absolutely the worst landlords I've EVER had. I've been assaulted by both of them. They illegally enter my unit over 2 dozen times.

1879,EDITH KRONER,CAMBRIDGE,I forgot to mention that she did nothing to clean and remove the black mold!!! My husband cleaned it with bleach himself!! We moved out shortly after.
1880,NORTH EDGE PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,"The ceilings were falling down, fraudulently closing maintenance requests when no work was done, black mold all over the bathrooms and no respect for tenants and reasonable enjoyment of the premises. They removed parking from the building to accommodate the condo being built next door."
1881,HOMESTEAD,OAKVILLE,When we moved in they said they recently did a reno on the parking garage and then proceeded to do another reno on the parking garage 6 months before we moved out. It got to a point where there was a giant hole in the floor. They also installed new doors when we moved in and then didn’t patch up the holes left in my apartment for about 3 months. There was also problems with the pipes being noisey to the point where it didn’t feel safe because we didn’t know what the sound was. Ended up evacuating along with a couple of other people. Where gaslit saying that nothing was wrong even though we’ve never heard of it before then. Once a month they’d shut off the water for one reason or another. Said that it would get better but it didn’t. Management was nice but it doesn’t make up for everything else. Rent was cheap but I’m pretty sure that tiny 1 bedroom is going for 2k+ now instead of the 1499 it was in 2019.
1882,RAJIV SHARMA,WATERLOO,"The worst landlord ever.  Apparently used to be a police officer, but looks at everyone like a criminal. Didn't even provide a lock to the door"
1883,DAVE CRANTON,BARRIE,"Dave Cranton does not care about his tenants, their health or their concerns. It's all about the money. While paying an obscene amount of rent I haven't had a single concern corrected or addressed. He refused ensure our safety while carelessly completing a basement renovation to allow for more tenants. The construction crew that he utilized for this was entirely unqualified and failed safety and health inspection EVERY SINGLE Time. Our home was filled with construction fumes and dust for months. They also used insufficient sound deadening so, we no longer have peace in our home since the new tenants moved in.

Overall, an honestly terrible experience and we cannot wait to leave this house and city. I'm so happy to have this opportunity to stop this cycle, thank you to the creators of this site."
1884,EDITH KRONER,CAMBRIDGE,"When filling out the application she asked if we smoke and what we smoke. This was 17 years ago!! We always had two parking spots, many empty parking spaces as kot everyone owned a vehicle. The instant we purchased a new vehicle she knocked at our door with a rent increase and started charging for parking! She asked if the vehicle was brand new...she was looking for money! The rent increase was above the allowed percentage and I fought her on it. She then went into war taking away our second parking spot and harassing us. We both knew she was trying to push us out to get more rent from the next person. We had lived there for 7 years, had a baby and she didn't want us there with a baby. There was a flood in the apartment below us of the 12 plex 3 story building. She tried to cover it up. Black mold grew from the unit below us up into our bedroom and she tried to say it grew from us having furniture pushed up against the wall! Little did she know that the tenant told us about the flood and mold in her apartment! We caught her trying to turn it on us! She NEVER did any upgrades, we kept our apartment clean and didn't do damage. We rented a carpet cleaner before we moved in on our dime. After we gave notice she approached me when I was walking my baby with an absurd notice stating that we had to pay her an insane amount of money for her to repaint the apartment and to fill thumbtack holes!!! Something like $1000!! It was normal wear. She did nothing in the 7 years we lived there! We never once paid our rent late, we were quiet and clean. She just had it out for us!! I hated her with a passion! She had a tenant in the building ""be a spy"" and tell her of our coming and goings. I could go on and on about how terrible this woman is!! I ended up with high blood pressure during pregnancy due to all the harassing she did to us!! Never rent from her.... Edith Kroner is terrible!!!"
1885,GREENWIN,EAST YORK,"Ive been living here for almost 4 years and i must say they are very sloppy with maintenance. Our closet door broke day 1 of us moving and it took them 3 years to replace it, our requests kept getting closed for no reason or notice. Our main issue now is roaches - we've raised this a few times and pest control came a few times and we still have small roaches. We keep our place clean and ensure that we dont get roaches. One of the pest control guy came and told us that its def not our unit and its a building issue.. lastly we have an outstanding issue that's still not resolved."
1886,TRACEY PIKE,OWEN SOUND,"STAY AWAY!  Demands you watch tv with headphones, cannot do laundry after 8pm- but also not during prime hydro.
Constantly barking Pomeranian. 
Fishlike odour from floor drains.  
Wants tenant to park at shoppers drug mart and not in the 3 car driveway- informed after moving in.
Verbally aggressive and screams like a maniac.  
Texted eviction threat stating “I could have you out in the street” when asked to be mindful of barking dog.
 Called police trying to have me removed for trespassing & saying she “didn’t feel safe” thinking RTA did not apply and I was a boarder.   
JUST.  STAY.  AWAY!"
1887,DAVINA AND AV WINER,HASTINGS,Davina and Av are literally the best landlords I have ever had in my life. They went above and beyond in relation to ensuring my elderly mom and I had the best experience renting their home in Hastings. I was so sad to move because of the excellent relationship we had with them.
1888,JOSHUA LAMBERT,BRANTFORD,"Bought the building and said was keeping all tenants just to win the bid. 3 days after taking possesion served 2 N12s to two out of three units and when the tenants left he left one unit vacant. And lived in the other waiting the year and then doubling the rent. Also offered the 3rd unit money to leave early. 

Nothing but greedy"
1889,LIVEWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"This rental company left my unit in a almost unlivable state for nearly a year. Between the back entry turning into a waterfall fixture to the grey/black water that would flood my basement. I lost thousands of dollars worth of items and hours of my life only to end up moving out without any consideration or replacements(monetary or actual replaced items). Jordana the property manager at the time refused to return calls or messages in a timely manner, was incredibly rude, and ignorant. 

As for the owners of the company I also found out the Are behind the landlord credit ratings website where they will publicly post your credit score and payment history with out your consent to a ratings site that's not accredited by the government of Canada or better business bureau, and not apart of a legal credit reporting agency. 

Stay clear, don't get involved."
1890,MAPLE LEAF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"The maintenance staff are usually pretty great and respectable, although they don’t always do their job right. The property managers however will walk in your unit without any notice or warning though. They do not have any respect for the tenants nor their concerns. The property managers will walk in an apartment without any concern on the tenants wellbeing. Terrible"
1891,ALEX SIMANOVSKY,EAST GWILLIMBURY,"He breaked the tenance act 3 times increase the rent against the Landlord and Tenace board guideline.
My rent was increased 65% in 3 years.
His excuses were that he refinanced the house, need to pay his daughters university, the variable interest rate was high.
He needed to increase against the law or will sell the house.
For thar price that he wanted, I moved away and get a better house for the same price."
1892,LAL PROPERTIES,LONDON,"We stayed one year and have no complaints. The landlord Samantha was very professional polite and honest. The location was perfect five
Mins to walk to school/college, mall and park was next door. Great place for the time we were there. Happy to be in our own house now that’s for sure!"
1893,DEVINDER SINGH ANAND,BRAMPTON,"Very worst landlord and a human bring. If he wants to raise rent beyond limit set by province, he will go any lengths to make it happen or get you out of house. He frequently harasses you by bringing multiple people to your house and sits for hours bargaining on rent. Never rent from this landlord and his sons."
1894,RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES (RPMS),TORONTO,h o r r I b l e.
1895,RENE RAINVILLE AND TAMMY HADDAD,HAGAR,"This is the worst landlord I’ve ever had- will never rent again because of the atrocity this landlord did- he was stealing off us for months- then, He raised the rent from $1000/month to $1600/month- a %60 increase! The house was in total disrepair- I spent a few hundred putting in fans/paint etc. as there weren’t even light fixtures in! He then wanted to put a squatter family of crackheads onto the property we were renting when we said NO- he went above and beyond to make our lives miserable- we put our notice in right away- he never stopped harassing us every single day- OPP were called almost every day- he assaulted me and OPP did nothing! Then while we were moving loads of our stuff out he went in and helped himself to all of our stuff that was left! Rene has even gone as far as threatening us if we visit my husbands parents/my in-laws who are also renting a house off of him that should be condemned! Oh I paid for a house inspection of the place we were renting and the inspector deemed the house not fit to live in due to all the structural damage and about 15 different types of mold found- and guess who he moved in- the crackhead squatters! This man is pure evil. He even stole my dogs and gave to the squatters to hold onto in their trailer! Never do any business with this man or his wife or anyone else in his family!"
1896,KE LIU,MARKHAM,"Very Badly maintained housing.
Doesnt care about the house and has serious concerns.

Only focussed in receiving rent."
1897,NINA CHRISTOU,TORONTO,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LADY. This lady is honestly A nut job. She rents out her basement apartment which only has one entrance/exit. The windows aren’t big enough for someone to go out if there was a fire. She changes the price of the rent whenever she feels like it. She will “fix” something and tell you to pay for it with no receipts. She has a dog that never stops barking. She refuses to allow visitors of any kind. She’s a racist to people of colour. She accused my black fiancé of being a drug dealer simply because he’s black. She changed the terms of the lease whenever she feels like it without notice. She enters the unit whenever she feels like it. One time I was changing in the bedroom and when I walked out of the bedroom she was in the living room. She allowed a cat and once we moved in the cat became a problem. She changed the locks one day as we where both out of town, she said it was because a random person was coming in, it was my mother checking in on my pet who nina had met mutiple times. She went around the neighborhood telling all the neighbors that my fiancé was a drug dealer and was the evil man. Hes a mover for a living he works long days and would come home late at night and leave early morning she would complain that he’s too loud and was waking her up. There’s a bar across the street and she would call the police saying that the people are the bar where being too loud and they would smoke outside the bar and the cigarette smell would bother her."
1898,RITA,YORK,"274 or 278 Glenholme Ave, York ON
This was such a long time ago. But Rita and her sons were great landlords. All 5's. Minor accidents such as a flooding due to reno. And dusting due to floor repair contractors upstairs. All were handled well. She took care of the reparations in a very fair manner by replacing damaged items and offering clean up."
1899,MB MANAGEMENT INC,TORONTO,Repairs took outrageous times to occur. Really had to contact them a lot. Painter repainted before move in and paint was everyone where on floors and counters. Washing machine was ancient and barely working with mold in it. Was told to wash it myself.
1900,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,Our Superintendent is wonderful and appreciates that this is our home.
1901,DEANNE MCCRAE & RAY KUNZ,OWEN SOUND,Currently case awaiting tribunal for violating tenant rights
1902,CAPREIT,NORTH YORK,"In terms of leaving you alone to live your life this particular office does well but they remain gone when repairs are requested. Anything that is not immediately affecting functionality is ignored. Mold, pipes leaking in the walls, electrical, flooring do not register on their radar. They also fired their on location superintendents so the area that was once a nice suburan complex is now a complete ghetto. Garbage is everywhere all the time. Its not uncommon to have to walk through a mine field of used diapers. One of this years snow storms downed some trees that were just left there for weeks, I guess in case any of the kids wanted to play American Gladiator. Speaking of winter, they don't even salt anymore, so if skating to and from your door is your thing, come on by.  They created an online portal for maintenance mainly so they didn't have to ignore your pleas in person.  It's a shame because before pandemic this was a great neighbourhood to live."
1903,BRADY DUNLOP,GUELPH,"Brady was a great landlord while studying at UofG. He would answer phone calls or get back to us quickly, and repairs were often made within a few days if needed. He ensured the safety of his tenants checking the fire extinguishers anytime he was at the home and that fire alarms were properly functioning. Very professional and reasonable."
1904,EAST WEST MGT,ETOBICOKE,"This review is for Lincoln Towers. This landlord has no respect for tenants, their safety or their privacy. The woman in their office (Roumi) speaks little English and has difficulty communicating with tenants verbally or in writing. Written notices are rude with garbled English. I sued them at the rental housing tribunal and the adjudicator reprimanded them for their abusive and threatening letters. They take every opportunity to snoop and spy on tenants to find excuses to evict us. They issue illegal entry notices, for example a notice that covers two or more days with no time of entry. They don't give 24 hours notice, they drop off notices as late as 6 pm for a 9 am entry the next day. They lie on entry notices about the reason for entry so they can snoop. If they do a big repair the owner sneaks into the apartment and rummages through the tenant's belongings. This man is verbally abusive and berates the tenant for having items he doesn't approve of. I'm disabled and he tried to force me to get rid of my walker. The building supposedly allows pets, but if they see cages or other signs of pets they call Ontario Animal Control and file false cruelty complaints to force the tenant to get rid of their pets. They try to bully and harass people to pay illegal fees, like $500 per air conditioner. They don't notify tenants about upcoming power or water shutoffs, all announcements are posted on the wall beside the elevators, so if you don't leave your apartment you don't get notified. My apartment is a slum. The kitchen cabinets have fallen off the walls twice and I had to nail them back up. The kitchen hasn't been renovated since the 1960's, the linoleum is almost worn through and the knobs on the cabinets are unsafe - I catch my fingers or my nails in them. There's no counter space and I have to use a kitchen cart. My fridge door is held on with duct tape. My stove drawer is broken open and from a different model of stove. Their cheap parquet wood floor tiles pop off from wear and tear and then they accuse the tenant of deliberately pouring water on them. If you ask for repairs they try to blame you and threaten to charge you and/or evict you. Same goes for bug spraying, I get three kinds of ants, spiders, flies, roaches and bedbugs. I have to seal food containers in Ziploc bags and keep them in the fridge or freezer. When I asked for spraying I was told I caused the bugs and would be billed for the exterminator. The real reason for the bugs is that my apartment is next to the garbage chute and they never spray or clean it. Foul odours and bugs from the garbage chute enter my bathroom vent so I have to keep the door closed. ."
1905,SKA APARTMENT TENTALS,LEAMINGTON,"Landlord is very cheap about doing required maintenance. Parking garage has a 40 year opener that is broken half the time. Building had broken down used elevators that were only replaced on their death bed. They jacked the rent up 6% to cover it. Some mold problems and there had been a pharaoh ant infestation that has come and gone for 3 years. They just spot treat an apartment when there’s a complaint and ignore the rest until another apartment is infested. Rent is ridiculously high considering building is old and you don’t have in suite laundry or a dish washer. $1500 plus for one bedroom and $1600 plus for 2 bedroom. Parking outside is $100 a month in a small town. You get gouged on laundry and they added a fee every time you load your card. They remodelled a few years back and the sound proofing is horrible. They tell you you can only have one pet which is illegal in Ontario. Also the office is shady. E-transfers, during Covid, were stolen and they tried to claim months later that the rent was never paid. On-site property managers are ok and they do their work in a timely manner."
1906,JAMES BELLIS,OTTAWA,Overal very responsive
1907,FRED MONETA,TORONRO,"I lived in Fred’s property for almost a year. He was very respectful, by the book which I appreciated. Lease agreement was legitimate and abided by. He had first aid kits and extinguishers present in the house and made sure that no bikes/ objects would be in the way of exists. Sure the house wasn’t the nicest (old, dirty, rooming house) but it was great for the price and location and everything worked. I highly recommend."
1908,PEMBROKE PROPERTIES INC,TORONTO,The building in question is 100 Pembroke where tenants make their pets poop and pee in the stairway. Also found random people sleeping there and doing drugs.
1909,VICTORIA BOEHM AND ADAM JUTZI,STRATFORD,"Victoria is an abusive bully, will blame the tenant for any repairs required. She is alternately friendly then absolutely hostile. If she disagrees with your parenting style she calls CAS and reports false information - she is mentally unstable and will try to ruin your life. Her partner Adam, backs her up in everything, even when she's fighting the neighbours. She's had her car keyed, and tires slashed because of trouble she caused in the neighbourhood. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRUST THEM OR RENT FROM THEM."
1910,METCAP,SCARBOROUGH,"NEW MANAGEMENT TO BUILDING. TOOK OVER 3 YEARS AGO. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MAINTENANCE REQUESTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. HAVE HAD TO PUT THE SAME REQUEST IN FOR 2 YEARS FOR NOTHING TO STILL GET DONE. THEIR PROCEDURES ARE RIDICULOUS. THEY CHANGED THE FIRE ALARM COMPANY AND IT TAKES FOR A FIRE TRUCK TO ARRIVE AFTER 25 MINS, WHEN AT THAT POINT IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL FIRE THE WHOLE BUILDING WOULD HAVE ALREADY COLLAPSED. PEST CONTROL IS AN ISSUE AND DOES NOT GET ADDRESSED ACCORDINGLY. THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOOK OF THE BUILDING AND REPAIRING UNITS FOR NEW TENANTS TO MOVE IN THAN TAKING CARE OF THE TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME."
1911,TRAFALGAR SENIOR HOMES LTD,OAKVILLE,"Great place to live, with a mix of seniors, single people and, families.  Quiet clean building. Everyone is friendly and kind. Awesome management."
1912,MIKE AND ALICE KOZUMPLIK,LONDON,Most horrible landlords I've ever dealt with.  Need to go to the city to get anything fixed.
1913,WESTWOOD HOLDING OR LIFE OF QUEEN OR BRIARLANE,TORONTO,"Stay away from these 11 buildings, the owner doesn’t care, about this bedbug, cockroach and mice infestation it’s only about the money 
The super Micheal is a piece of work harasses, threatens, and bullies only the woman that I have scene he also told me personally “ I am evicting this neighbour if you talk with me or help said neighbour I will be evicted as well” 
The owner was charged at the LTB with harassment and fined 3 grand  owner loves that ppl hate them, As soon as you mention a T-2 the owner gives you a buy out (4grand as high as 20 grand) knowing once it’s filed you don’t live there it’s thrown out  
Maintance good luck with that buildings have mold in them 
Front doors don’t lock homeless ppl piss on the bottom floors and poop as well they blame tenants for it 
We stay here because I pay a little over 900 a month now the places are worth for same unit not 8 years later 2100 a month 
The electric flickers on and off the heats go off a few times in winter for days or weeks it’s normal I guess to save $$$$$ briar lane just took over we all got rent owing for 3 months evictions papers 

Poorly managed and no respect stay away from these buildings"
1914,CHINWE ILOABACHIE,OTTAWA,Chinwe was just not a good person. We rented a home from her for 15 years. When our dishwasher broke after 13 years she stated that hers was still working after 20. When we asked for flooring instead of carpet after 7 years she bought it and made my husband install it and would not let him buy the finishing pieces. My husband had a cardiac arrest at 42 and I honestly believe she was a main cause of this. He was constantly stressed having to deal with her. I cannot say enough to warn people to stay away from her properties (she has a few).
1915,LEILA RAHIMTARGHI,NORTH YORK,"136 Alfred Ave. North York ON, M2N3H9
A poorly kept, moldy, run down home in Willowdale. Many issues such as flooding, non working electrical outlets (the husband ""fixed it"" by running an extension chord from the fridge's outlet which popped as he was working on it), mice, very poor lighting, lack of winter driveway maintenance (an elderly tenant fell and had to get medical treatment), refusal to provide rent receipts.
All of these issues were met with little to no investment at all or denial. They are or were operating through a realtor."
1916,ERIN HANNAH,MILTON,"I hope to god her and her husband are no longer landlords. They either didn’t understand the law, or didn’t care to follow it."
1917,K-W PROPERTY MANAGEMENT CORPORATION,KITCHENER,"KW Property Group is complacent, disrespectful, and does not abide by the landlord-tenant act. Repairs are left without response, solutions are inadequate and unsafe, and communicating with them is a nightmare, when they even answer. They are dishonest and will attempt to charge tenants against the protocols in the Act, be sure to look into any claim the make (this brought down the 'rental stability rating' as unexpected/ additional charges built up and increased monthly payments).  

I have lived in their properties and viewed several, there are bug infestation and animal concerns in many, which many tenants have been flagging for years. 

During the move out / viewing process, they allowed people to touch and move personal belongings (some missing items) despite a distinct promise to ensure safety and privacy during the viewings. They were not willing to work with us to be present for the viewings. 

This group exists to protect landlords, not to mutually benefit tenants and landlords. Even so, I would advise both tenants and landlords to look elsewhere to avoid headaches, bugs, liability, and disrespect."
1918,WIGWAMEN INCORPORATED,TORONTO,"There is much money to be made by those who are not Indigenous, but portray themselves as sensitive to the needs of the Indigenous they are supposed to serve. 

Unfortunately, they place their Indigenous tenants at risk by placing them with non-Indigenous, non-subsidized tenants... and this is where the racism begins.

My name is Rick Bertrand, a former tenant at Place Perrault in Orleans, which is owned by Wigwamen Incorporated, and I am currently in the process of commencing a large Civil suit against them for the situation they placed me in. 

Their own staff member threatened to shoot me, as well as Place Perrault knowingly hiding a violent criminal in the same building at the time.

To all othe Indigenous tenants, do yourselves a favor. Avoid renting from Wigwamen Incorporated at all cost."
1919,CAPREIT,OTTAWA,"CAPREIT took over this area from Homestead about 28 months ago. Boy, do I miss Homestead? Never thought I would say that..... maintenance people are useless and drive around sitting in their vans for hours at a time. I always wonder what they are doing.. must be a good game on their phones... The garbage area used to be cleaned daily. Now maybe once a week. Garbage bins left in the street partially block the roads. They used to go in an enclosed area, but they are too lazy to keep them in there so the garbage is all over the streets and blows on the lawns. If they worked on this, I would give a better review. Besides this, they have been working on the outside of the houses and fences, not bad but if you want something done inside, they will just ask you if you want to move to a newly renovated house at double the cost instead of fixing the stuff for the long-term renters who pay half of what the houses are going for now. Shitty tactic but is to be expected. Happy to write a few again in a year and see if anything changes, but not likely after the 28 months they have been in control."
1920,100 GROUP CORPORATION,TORONTO,"Very large LL corp in Toronto.  Could do better in responding to general inquiries.  Old building that requires some upgrades for heating/plumbing, but no real complaints otherwise."
1921,CAPREIT,TORONTO,"They took months to replace a peephole who was totally blanked when the door was painted.
The build was infested of bugs and roaches. I had to write then several times to fix the problem, and even after an inspection and have products applies, it did not solve the problem. They only checked the unit, as the problem was affecting the entire building"
1922,METCAP,TORONTO,"Lived in a MetCap building for five years. From move in, it was impossible to get them to tend to any maintenance requests that were not about pests and even that had to be insisted on and took ages to schedule. 

Had to get the LTB involved twice over outstanding maintenance, including no heat in the unit for the entire duration of the rental agreement."
1923,CAPREIT,OTTAWA,"CAPREIT took over this area from Homestead about 28 months ago. Boy, do I miss Homestead?

1924,BRIAN KINMOND,TRENTON,"Refuses to repair. Harasses. Threatens. Is not afraid to lie in court or provide false documentation. Has a ton of money and will pay off anybody to get them to lie in court. Owns multiple properties both industrial and residential. Has been sued and taken to ltb many times by multitudes of people, but nine times out of ten ... Weasels his way out of it."
1925,ASHBURNHAM REALTY,PETERBOROUGH,They are pretty great.  I've been renting for a number of years and they have not done anything sketchy and are very respectful
1926,OMAR TAHIRI,WHITBY,"Omar was a character, was hesitant to fix laundry machine issues. Said I had to cover repairs under $100, which is illegal. When I decided to leave he ignored all my messages in terms of a reference, failed to follow up the final walk throughs and wanted me to make repairs that were not caused by me. He was disrespectful when he realized we were not extending the lease. Would not recommend."
1927,TRISTAN RITCHIE,SUDBURY,Amazing landlord. Always quick and very responsive willing to help his Tenants. Also a great Realtor here in Sudbury!
1928,WESTDALE PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"I've lived in one of their buildings for several years and had an excellent experience. Very prompt responses to maintenance requests - staff will even reach out to follow up on issues, to make sure problems are not happening again. Friendly and professional staff who seem to know the names of not just all the residents in their buildings, but regular visitors, too! No pests beyond the odd silverfish. Common spaces are brightly lit and cleaned regularly. Regular maintenance is done on the property (painting hallways, duct cleaning, parking lot repairs etc.). Landlord follows all rules about proper notice to enter units and increase rent (which they will do each year). 

My only complaint is the extensive application process. By far the most detailed application I've had to fill out when applying to rent somewhere. They will ask your bank to provide a statement on your banking history and average account balance. They also ask for your SIN - but you do not have to give it to be accepted as a tenant (I did not). When I rented, they asked me to sign a statement that it was a pet-free building and I would agree not to have any pets. This statement is contrary to Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act (landlords cannot prevent you from having pets once you live in the building, as long as these pets are not causing problems for other residents). In all fairness, despite having me sign this statement, Westdale does not even try to enforce these agreements. Once in the building, residents are asked to fill out an annual fire update sheet, which includes how many pets are in the unit. And there are many dogs and cats in my building!"
1929,MAYFAIR MANSIONS HOLDINGS,TORONTO,"The landlord/superintendent, Frank, is grouchy. You can't approach him for anything. 

Also, the repair person has walked into my unit twice by ""accident"" and hits on women and makes really questionable comments. 

I couldn't get a cupboard fixed for over a year. This building is ridiculous and don't get me started on the roaches."
1930,IVAN SHAM,SCARBOROUGH,"Great landlord, responsive and very understanding when it comes to negotiating rent."
1931,ELAINE MCCRON,BARRIE,elaine and family has always treated me and my husband with the utmost respect...she is a lovely person and i would keep renting from her for as long as possible
1932,JOHN WALTER JANSEN (RELIABLE RENTALS),SAINT CATHARINES,"Reliable Rentals is anything but. They're very unprofessional , they're very well known for not fixing issues in their tenants apartments, forcing tenants out due to maintenance issues so they can renovate after their tenants have vacated their unit , so they can charge outlandish rent. Since my time here I've seen countless tenants move out ranging from mold, to plumbing, lack of heating in several units The property is unsafe due to the constant vagrants that come on the property either to shoot up their drugs or empty out the cigarette butt cans. Also if youre late on your rent they will to try and charge you late fees , which is illegal.The owner John Walter Jansesn is a pompous, rude and unpleasant to deal with. If you are considering looking to live in the Saint Catharines area, I would seriously consider staying away from Reliable Rentals."
1933,TRISTAN RITCHIE,SUDBURY,Great Landlord. Very responsive when issues arise.  Enjoyed my time in his duplex!
1934,BRUNO NDAYE,TORONTO,"This man is sketchy and rude. For months he was trying to bully me out of my unit- either by raising the rent an insane amount, or with threats of me ""impersonating the owner"" when I needed to sign up my car for the new parking system in the building. He is extremely rude when he communicates with me. He has lied to me about needing the unit for his own family and saying I needed to move out.. TURNS OUT that after months of being threatened to move out, he wasn't paying his mortgage and the unit got rekeyed by a law firm. He is without a doubt the worst landlord I've ever had the displeasure of communicating with.

Oh PS, he has a criminal record with gun-related charges if you just google his name and Toronto News. 

He is rude and potentially dangerous. Stay away from this man."
1935,TINA MARTINS / AF MARTINS,OTTAWA,"The units are fine, typical rental quality for the student-dense location. There are a ton of illegal clauses added to leases - i recommend that tenants read up on their rights as this landlord counts on tenants being young students unaware of their rights. Tread carefully if you want a good tenant landlord relationship - this landlord will act pleasant and professional, but the second you let on that you know your rights, ask reasonable questions or ask for them to fulfill their duties, she will flip a switch and become extremely disrespectful and volatile. Responsiveness is erratic - sometimes it is immediate and sometimes it takes several emails and calls over weeks. If you need repairs or anything, good luck. They will either not respond, try to suggest you fix the problem yourself with your own money, or try to blame and charge you for the fix. Also know that if she commits to something verbally, she knows better than to put it in writing and will lie later on - never give her the benefit of the doubt and try your best to get her to put things clearly in writing. No issues with invading privacy though. Biggest advice is know your rights and don’t be bullied into letting them neglect their responsibilities when they gaslit, blame or demean."
1936,CHARLIE R,BRAMPTON,"At first the place seemed fine but it wasn't long untill problems started. Charlie was fairly ok about replacing or fixing things (namely the power kept going out) but other things (washer/dryer) kept having issues that were never resolved. He had an issue with privacy & boundaries. I guess he figured because I was renting his bsmt, he could just show up & enter whenever he wanted. There was one time (early Saturday morning) when my daughter (a baby at the time) & I were sleeping. It took her ages to go to sleep so it was late when we finally fell asleep. I was woken up to a loud pounding at my door & my phone ringing. When I answer the phone, it was Charlie's wife calling to tell me that they had guys waiting outside to clean the ducts in the bsmt & that I had to let them in. There was no prior warning, heads up or anything. I had to wake my daughter up & then rush to get some clothes on. Charlie's wife showed the guys where the vents were & then just left the guys down there with us. 

After confronting Charlie about this incident, he blew up, got violent, started cursing obscenities at me saying I was being difficult & he's never had this problem with other tenants. This all happened because I simply asked for a little consideration in the future in terms of access to the unit. I explained that I get there's maintenance & such that has to be done but letting me know ahead of time is considerate among other things. It takes no effort to send a text message to let me know that they need to get into the bsmt for whatever. Apparently asking for a heads up was me being difficult. Charlie cursed at me again saying that I was costing him money & making the work take longer than necessary. There was another similar instance where another repair guy was supposed to show up & never did but apparently told Charlie at 9 something at night that he was still supposedly coming. I ended up sitting up till 10pm waiting with my daughter because Charlie said this guy was coming. When it hit 10:30pm & I told Charlie that my daughter & I needed to sleep, he again got irate saying I was costing him money & that he will have to reschedule for the repair guy to come again, etc...

For a bit after that, Charlie would send a text ahead of time for whatever but then he stopped. He & his wife went back to just showing up at my door. Another time I was working (I work from home) & with no warning, Charlie shows up with a whole crew of guys who start using power tools in the bsmt. I couldn't finish work & was forced to log out for the entire day. The guys seemed to think it was funny that I was there trying to work & I guess didn't realize that I would be in the unit in the first place. Another time, Charlie showed up with a city inspector to check the bsmt (apparently someone complained to the city about too many cars in the driveway), the inspector saw my daughter & I then said that he couldn't check the bsmt but that it was illegal & we would have to vacate. Other than Charlie's attitude, we lived in that bsmt unit for over a year & a half with no problems but were forced to move."
1937,MEGAN CURRAN,ALLISTON,place was a dump kids ate all my food and I was ripped off $700.00 dollars
1938,LAL PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"We went to a month into the pandemic in 2020, and we couldn’t meet with the landlord at the time to the Covid restrictions that we were really impressed with the apartment. The company is very professional and reliable. They arrange times that we are mutually convenient for us to meet for repairs or inspections. Very flexible. Their only stipulation is that the rent should be paid on time. This is a good company to rent from."
1939,THERESA CERILLI,SUDBURY,"Theresa is a terrible landlord. I have been living at one of her buildings between 1-2 years (not being specific to remain anonymous) and it’s been awful. The building is infested with mice, which was not disclosed to us prior to moving on. To keep the mice out of our apartment we had to do over $200 of work to seal all holes with spray foam. We needed to clean the apartment when we moved in, there was mold in and cigarette ashes in every window. Outlet and light switch covers needed to be bought and installed by us. There are no baseboards. Light fixtures had mice poop in them. When the kitchen faucet started leaking water everywhere, she never fixed it and we had to buy a new faucet (which she has never paid us back for). People smoke in their apartments and the smell comes into ours, we are non-smokers with kids. It’s disgusting.  The rest of the building is worse, graffiti is everywhere, garbage all over the yard, the parking spaces don’t have numbers and people steal our parking spot. The mailbox took a year to be replaced, and we had to get our mail across town. The front door doesn’t lock and people stay in the stairwell to do drugs and sleep. I’m sure I’m missing things. It has been an awful experience and has caused a lot of mental distress."
1940,CAPREIT,TORONTO,"Run far run fast! They do as little as they can (except cosmetic renos in the laundry room or hobby that LOOK good) and invariably raise the rent every year. The laundry room is a mess; if you have loud neighbours who drive you crazy, you have to insist and insist and even scream at them before they do anything; unless you're an old tenant, you'll pay through the roof for your AC and heating, as they allied themselves with some scamming company; almost no security (our parcels get routinely stolen and I was threatened by psychos a couple of times); etc. Once when I complained about a leaking faucet in my kitchen just before my vacation, I came back to an apt. with no water in the kitchen (a smelly brown gelatinous substance was coming out of it) for weeks, a hole behind the toilet, a toilet which did not flush and dirty crap on my bed. I repeat: run far run fast. PS And don't get me started on the 'hood: quadruple forte concerts all summer and fall long (your apt. will literally shake!), drug addicts screaming at 2-3 AM, scary people on the street and sometimes inside the building, many many pigeons shitting all over balconies, etc."
1941,MEDALLION PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,"This company is so brutal. I have been a tenant for nine years at this property. They purchased the building during my tenancy. 

While it’s a reliable stable rental, they are AWFUL with repairs and management. 

Just a few (of many!) examples: I have been left for months with a leak in my bathroom ceiling and a huge hole, I have been in the past left for SEVERAL weeks with no heat, and if you have heat, it’s scorching hot where you have to turn the AC on in the middle of winter. There’s TONS of garbage behind our building that they have yet to get rid of (months). 

At one point they contacted us to tell us they had a change in management and things would get better. They did replace our balconies, but this place needs SO much work. If they got their stuff together in the repairs and upkeep department, this place would be a dream. 

Last thing I’ll say — once they finally started working on my bathroom leak/ceiling, the contractor was going in and out on different days and times and one time, they showed up unannounced, I was in my bed SLEEPING because I had worked nights, and the Super knocked, came in, and LET THE CONTRACTOR IN WHILE I WAS SLEEPING AND DIDNT WAKE ME UP. The super also LEFT him alone to work and I woke up to a STRANGE MAN WORKING IN MY BATHROOM!  

So incredibly brutal. Anyway… rent with much caution from Medallion Corp Hamilton."
1942,DANIELS GATEWAY,MISSISSAUGA,"Overpriced and low end finishes, staff are condescending. It takes multiple emails to have any repairs done and repair people are rude."
1943,ANDRE LEFBVRE,OTTAWA,My apartment was infested with insects and my landlord did nothing to remediate. I sent him weekly pictures and they were simply ignored.
1944,FATIMA ASKARI,MISSISSAUGA,"Terrible landlord, refused to repair broken sink, toilet, and washer at her condo at 265 enfield place. The condo has cockroaches and mold aswell which she took no responsibility for! Stay away"
1945,LAL PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,This was a great experience for us. We were new to the area and not sure what to expect. Our apartment was beautiful.  Our landlord Samantha was knowledgeable and honest and showed us everything about the paperwork. She even told us what to be wary of when looking to avoid scams. If we needed anything repairs they were very willing to do this. Definitely would recommend them.
1946,LORD NELSON TOWNHOMES,LONDON,"The townhomes are ok, not fancy but they the rent goes up every single year and the moment someone moves out they do a few updates and jack the rent up by at least 40%. The landlord on site is mean and hard to talk to. They are biggots too. I only stay as my rent remains cheaper as I moved in before they started inflating the rent. Don't move here."
1947,SATELLITE COMMUNITY HOMES (HOME CONCEPT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),CAMBRIDGE,"100% occupancy and cleanliness best describes how the landlord manages the building. There is always someone to contact in case of concern or emergency. 
Monthly testing of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, as well as annual in-person testing of alarms in each apartment or unit number."
1948,MARTA CZARNECKA,OTTAWA,Nice neighbourhood but the house is a dump. This landlord acts like it’s a mansion and tenants should feel privileged to rent from them. The floors are like walking on a trampoline and there is a water leak somewhere with a constant smell of mould. Landlord seems to be just trying to do the bare minimum to have the mortgage covered until they can flip the property.
1949,TERRI FRANK,TORONTO,"Terri is very responsive, courteous, communicative and thoughtful landlord. Having tenanted several properties across the GTA I can confidently say she is head and shoulders above any landlord I’ve had."
1950,PARKBRIDGE LIFESTYLE COMMUNITIES,OTTAWA,"Parkbrige corporation are the slumlords of Ontario! They lease land with owned trailers in trailer parks across Canada and profit off of not repairing or maintaining their land at all. 
In the 3 years I've been here, two storms and subsequent power outages occurred that damaged my shed from their trees they refuse to trim or remove. The street i live on has not been swept for years and creates respiratory issues- lot fees we pay are supposed to cover road maintenance. 
Roads are full of potholes and my neighbor injured herself falling in one just the other week again. Every year they apply to increase rent past the 2% allowable amount claiming they made 'upgrades'. They also claim we have 'amenities' and 'common areas' which we certainly don't. 

During the first power outage residents here were without power for 2 weeks because they would not remove their tree from a power line, insisting the home owner would do it (they were out of town and it wasn't their responsibility).

They also release names of all the home owners in each park when they are trying to increase lot fees by 18%- clearly they do not think they have to follow any laws.

Property management is unresponsive, unhelpful, condescending and rude.
Isidor Demers and Jason Wakem ('property managers') are useless but I'm sure they sleep well at night!"
1951,GREENWIN,KITCHENER,We talk with the landlords to respect previous agreements and they don't take care about anything.
1952,PRESTON LIVING,EAST YORK (WOODBINE HEIGHTS),The manager in 2 Secord Avenue is a racist person. She treats people according to race and background. People from different color background felt the same.
1953,COSMINA UTHAYAKUMAR,SCARBOROUGH,"Every faucet in house leaked when we moved in, dead cockroaches under the stove, windows were leaking into the wall, tubs were so rusted we couldn't use them, door handles on backwards, house smelled and was extremely dirty when we moved in even though landlord was the previous resident. Demanded we have a professional cleaner when we moved out because they didn't like my cats. Complained about pets even though no pet provisions are void. Complained when we told them we were moving because we purchased a house, official notice hadn't been given yet but they said we should have given more notice. Came to do an inspection to ensure things were in working order, went through all my closets and all my belongings. Threatened to evict us for personal use, then sent messages asking if we were moving on a certain date when no official notice was given by either side. Still had all their mail and packages delivered to the home and expected us to hold onto them and out them out when they wanted to pick up. Rude and disrespectful each time we saw them. No idea about the laws or how to be a landlord, thought that they could do whatever they wanted. Did not return key deposit, will not return messages regarding same."
1954,ST LAURENT TOWERS  / COGIR MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"This place is infested with cockroaches. I was warned by a friend not to stay here because they said management is not good with maintenance requests ,but I decided to stay here anyway because I needed to move .No matter how many times they claim they are doing pest control , the cockroaches come back, even baby cockroaches. Another tenant who lives here told me that I may not be able to take my furniture when I leave due to bed bugs potentially. They rope you in with “Two months free rent ,” but that’s usually to cover up for their shortcomings. This place is so ghetto , homeless people come though here sometimes . Talking to management to get shit done is like pulling teeth . Read the Google reviews about St. Laurent Towers . If you want to stay sane , then don’t move here . These buildings need to be demolished. When I was moving my things in , a tenant asked me if I’m moving in , when I said yes , she said “good luck,” basically implying that here is not a good place to live . It’s very hard for them to be organized and do their jobs, which is property management."
1955,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS LTD.,KITCHENER,"This company cannot hold onto managers. Managers that try to advocate for the tenants disappear within 6 months. Head office play-acts at concern for our requests and everything we request is “pending” but never arrives. Currently the fire alarm goes off at least once a month due to a poorly maintained sprinkler system. By now, nobody leaves their apartments when it goes off. The fire company should sue for all the unnecessary trips and use of their resources. Heaven help us if there ever is a serious fire."
1956,CHRISTINE BARTSIOKAS,SCARBOROUGH,"Christine, her husband and brother owned the home we rented.  Everything was in good working order when we moved in and any issues we had were dealt with quickly. Ultimately they decided to sell the home and we moved but they gave us lots of notice they intended to sell.  They were extremely kind and respectful at all times and in all communications."
1957,GOLDEN EQUITY,OTTAWA,"Golden Equity is Absolutely the worst company I've ever rented from.
Full of Cockroaches and is very unsafe.
******** continuously had police there due to all the Crack heads and homeless people roaming about. The building management didn't care about safety and refused to fix the front door for 6 months allowing homeless people to sleep and do drugs in the halls right outside of units. Was constantly harassed by other tenants who lived there forever and despite persistant emails to management nothing was resolved. They kept our key deposits even though there was an agreement signed to repay after tenancy was over. The cleaners and maintenance people are very lazy hardly ever doing their jobs, instead standing around smoking all day.Lesson learned. Will pay better attention to reviews."
1958,STEPHEN PRATAPRAJ,WELLAND,"So far very happy with Stephen, this home is newer and was well looked after. Always very easy to get ahold of, very quick to reply if their is a problem. Would say this man and his family are good to deal with, the house is far away from the GTA but in a great area."
1959,JANE AND DAVID HAYWARD,OTTAWA,We were deceived into leaving.  They said they wanted the place as they were moving in.  As soon as we left they increased the rent substantially and proceeded to rent it out.
1960,BRIARLANE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"The superintendent/management is incompetent, disrespectful, has no social skills and cannot communicate effectively with tenants, and neglects the maintenance of the building(they had to get fined from 311 and finally hired 3rd party cleaners). The girl has a BIG attitude problem. Management acknowledged that they were having budget issues when the super was hired."
1961,LUIS FRAZAO,TORONTO,"Really kind and helpfull 
Always willing to help and thinks about how we are"
1962,COSMINA UTHAKAYAKUMAR,SCARBOROUGH,"Every faucet in house leaked when we moved in, dead cockroaches under the stove, windows were leaking into the wall, tubs were so rusted we couldn't use them, door handles on backwards, house smelled and was extremely dirty when we moved in even though landlord was the previous resident.

1963,FOREST HILL KIPLING,TORONTO,"Our building has been under construction for 2 years and still have another 3 years at least. We have been lied to, disrespected constantly and treated as second class citizens"
1964,MICHAEL COLLINS,BARRIE,"Mike and his wife are amazing humans. Their property is below market value, they are prompt with any requests and repairs."
1965,RANEE MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"building at 3000 victoria park ave is solid, with the typical old Toronto building problems, like some cockroaches/pests. they do the seasonal pest spray to control it. in general the unit never had need for serious repairs, but once we had floorboards that came out and they were replaced with non-matching floorboards (i mean whatever its a rental). no bedbugs though in the several years i lived there. management minded their own business for the most part so that was well appreciated. rental prices are pretty stable over years, so it was an affordable place to live"
1966,NANCY HONG NA,LONDON,Good landlord
1967,DREWLO HOLDINGS,LONDON,Increasing rents when repairs are left neglected and ignoring tenants when they follow up.
1968,AKELIUS,TORONTO,My problem is with the unit above me. Unfortunately is 6 months I’m complaining and Akelius seems to not take it seriously as it should.
1969,FRANKWARE/ FRANK AKUJOBI,OTTAWA,"The property on 206 Ste Anne is dirty, poorly maintained, crawling with millions of cockroaches and bugs. 
The landlord thinks he has a million dollar property and is charging a lot of money to live in his trashy building. Avoid. At all costs. The landlord tries to advertise ""nightly rate-like hotel"". Don't fall for this. The ""super"" Ed is a crackhead and the back of building is where he stores his needles. The landlord is a money hungry slum lord. The building is gross, dirty and poorly maintained. Living here was a nightmare and I want to prevent anyone else from being taken advantage of like we were. We had to throw out a lot of stuff because of the bugs  This Frank guy refuses to properly deal with. The place is furnished with stuff taken from the garbage and even sitting on the couch you would be surrounded by bugs. Super gross. Over priced Garbage is what this is."
1970,EAST WEST MGT,TORONTO,"Estelle needs to retire. She makes racist jokes and then gets annoyed when you don't laugh. She refuses to send email notifications rather than only posting them in the lobby or elevator. Get with the times!!!!! She also says we are on a one way street, its not. No one ever cleans the stairwells. There's a park in the back that's been closed for at least 3 years. It's not the worst, but also not the best. And transit is a nightmare"
1971,PAM GARDENS,LONDON,"Maintenance people complain about
Tenants all the time. Things such as: they don’t get out of bed in the morning, dirty, etc. Meanwhile they don’t fix anything and do as little as possible. It is quite common to have maintenance people come into your unit without notice and unannounced. This is not acceptable."
1972,FAMILY PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,Since this new owner bought our building they have not kept up with any repairs. They have no maintainence forms available. They have started renovictions. The laundry machines are filthy and have not been cleaned in years. They mop the floors with the same water on each floor when the do mop. The doors for the building do not lock unless you do it yourself with key because the lock is broken.  The intercoms don't work. There is no super any more.
1973,"HARVEY DONG AS AGENT, REMAX IMPERIAL, FOR LANDLORD GANGHU ZHANG",MARKHAM,"Harvey Dong was the agent for a landlord that was not in Canada.  Repairs were done by handymen who had no idea what they were doing, wouldn't send in an actual plumber to fix the plumbing issues or a roofer to fix the roof leak.  Gave us one key for one door that couldn't be copied.  No working smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors. Basement was leaking into the wall, mold issues.  Brought actual landlord with less than 24 hours notice, when I wouldn't let them go through house they threatened to come back at 11 p.m. the next day.  Did not cash rent cheques regularly, would cash them in batches months and months later.  Sent another agent to do his dirty work.  Told us they were selling the house the day before showings were to start - while the 24 hour requirement was met they must have known that they were selling the house before that but gave us no notice to get the place ready for showings and then complained.  Wanted our key for the lock box (remember, they only gave us one that couldn't be copied). Evicted us for personal use of new owners, did not pay the required compensation, did not return key deposit."
1974,YONGE PLEASANT HOLDINGS LIMITED,TORONTO,"I have lived at ********** for over a decade and have seen a lot of change. This is a family owned company and they treat it as such. Management used to invest in accommodating their Tenants but over the past few years it's all about making money. Upgrades galore! With that being said, the building is very well maintained however if Management can cheap out they will. You can only communicate with Management by letter and usually have to get aggressive with your words to actually be heard. The difference in generations running the building is very obvious but they do follow the law which is most important. The suites here are slightly over priced due to the area and most areas of the building have been upgraded; washers & dryers, forced air heat, electrical, balconies etc. As far as a Landlord they are decent but they need to modernize communication methods."
1975,SARA PRESSON,BOWMANVILLE,"One of the worse landlords I have ever had. She wouldn’t deal with any problems that were brought to her attention. She chose to keep a tenant who started a fire in her apartment from smoking which wasn’t allowed in the entire building, she didn’t do anything when it was reported time after time the tenant was harassing & causing issues with another tenant in the building. In fact her response to avoid dealing with it all was to put the building up for sale & didn’t disclose to the new owners any of the issues that were going on. To get any response from her about the issues, an application had to be filed against her with the LTB. She was rude & very unprofessional when any interactions had to be had with her. I would not ever live anywhere she was the Landlord/Owner of the building/property etc…"
1976,WINSTON GEORGE TANNIS,OTTAWA,"This landlord suffers from delusions and believed we had some sort of romantic connection. I was sexually harassed by him, he also would not follow through on repairs, for instance, our furnace was broken during winter months and he delayed repairs using a variety of excuses including waiting to fly in a Muslim furnace expert from the Middle East and too busy as he is working to solve the crisis between Palestine and Israel. He eventually attempted to have use evicted, which he lost and we left shortly after we had found other stable housing."
1977,JENNIFER VANDERSLUIS,GRANDVALLEY,"I must say that i am very lucky to have a good landlord, she is always open with communication, when there is an issue it is quick to be fixed by her, compensated if I fix, or have a professional in to fix it.  The house I live in I treat the best I can. everything is safe, fire stuff is up to date and if something needs changed it is done right away!! Thank you to her for allowing me to live in her property much appreciated"
1978,ENDERBY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Best landlords I've had, and especially in a big building with a company that owns multiple properties, I think that's really saying a lot. Also, an Uncle of mine was once my landlord. He was worse LOL."
1979,PARKPLACE PROPERTIES LTD,LONDON,"Andy is and was a horrible landlord this was our experience ….
We were promised to have our unit repairs complete upon moving. It was not …he made us wait the entire day to move in as he scrambled to get the unit move in ready. We were promised ac installation as well, that never happened so we got our own without complaint. Upon move in many of the repairs were incomplete such as missing baseboards, flooring, door handles, we had no cupboard doors and incomplete paint job of the cupboards, when the hot water pump went down had to harass landlord Andy to get plumber in and once he did gave us no notice of water being off for repairs, Andy intentionally avoided communication to address concerns, would allow for his workers to take our parking spots which we paid significantly for this man does business inhumanely. He does not care for his tenants and is focused only on money! So sad this is how humans choose to be towards each other and sad housing has become more about greed & money when it should be about equality, stability and general care for one another."
1980,WILL BONNYCASTLE,KINGSTON,10/10 dude. He newly renovated the unit when we moved in so everything looked great for a student house. Was super responsive to repairs and gave us plenty of notice if he needed to come by. He even came to help me jump start my car one winter after the battery died. Cannot recommend enough!
1981,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"They let us move into a unit that had fire damage, without telling us, and never repaired some of the damage.

They also raised the rent by more than the legal amount one year, and said if you have a complaint you can hire a paralegal cuz u prob can't afford a lawyer. I was shocked!!!!

Bed bugs, roaches, lazy security, endless fire alarms. And when I asked about some of the concerns I saw online, the prop manager told me not to believe everything I read. I regret listening to her."
1982,KINGLEY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,I’ve lived here many years We are on Super number 6. This is the worst company to deal with Repairs have to be submitted then Their handy man comes and doesn’t fix anything so you have to wait for a real repair person I’m on week 5 waiting for a repair. People with pets let them urinate in elevators and shit all over outside People speed through parking lot. The rent for new tenants is over 2100 a month It isn’t worth it stay away
1983,COGIR,NORTH YORK,Horrible horrible company
1984,SYEDA FATIMA,MILTON,"Never met this person who i signed a lease with which i thought to be very fishy. Husband Kashif does everything. Tricks you into thinking they are selling house. You move in good faith to find out they rented to someone at a higher price. Never wants to fix anything. Very unresponsive. A hustler, a liar, a cheat, cheap and does not want to spend money for upkeep. Good luck getting anything fixed. Good luck period. Worst landlord i ever had."
1985,DANA MOUNTAIN,COURTICE,"Horrible landlord, doesn't care about the tenants and just wants your money. Mold all over the house, leaky windows, lots of crap wrong and never told me before moving in. 2 tenants moved in and out in two months before i did because of the same issue and she somehow kept getting away with this until i got bylaw involved. Bylaw forced her to fix the mold issue, which when i checked it out the guys fixing the mold told us its temporary and the mold will be back as the landlord did not want to pay to fix the main cause of the mold and wanted to keep materials at a low cost by keeping some of the moldy dry wall. Dana also left her copy of my house keys outside while i was not home and my upstairs neighbours found them and told me they were in the recycle bin, she then told me she handed them to the neighbours to cover it up because i found out, she also has touched personal belongings several times while nobody was home, don't trust a word this old lady says. 
DO NOT MOVE INTO ANY OF HER UNITS."
1986,GREENROCK,TORONTO,nothing to say other than that
1987,ER HOLDINGS,NORTH BAY,"The landlord, Ryan, has been pretty great over the last few years. The apartment was freshly renovated and clean when I moved in. I had some issues with mold in weird places (baseboards?) and they came through and thoroughly cleaned it up. Had an issue as small as an old showerhead, and it was replaced within the week. A pipe broke and wrecked the underfloor, he came and repaired the whole area and ensured the issue wouldn't happen again. 

They have snow clearing service, yard service, and yearly gardening in the backyard. And the rent is reasonable for our area. I pay my rent on time, and unless there's repairs or maintenance, I have very little interaction with my landlord. They're polite, friendly, and very helpful. 

I really wish there were more places that offered this kind of housing at this kind of pricing and service. Everyone in their family I've had dealings with have been wonderful. It's how being a landlord SHOULD work."
1988,MEDALLION CORPORATION,TORONTO,"Management of this place is nothing but useless. Anything ""fixed"" not only takes forever if done at all, but is all cosmetic. Multiple leaks in the building from the 1st floor to the 9th floor. This is for ""55 LISGAR STREET"" not only is this a structural issue it poses a health risk with the black mold that's built up over the years probably decades. Maximum rate hike is 2.5% but it's gone up 2.96%. Might not be that big but multiply it by the number tenants and the years that's alot of money. No help for the superintendents either. They have 1 person per building. Resulting in overloading the workload to line the management and owner's pockets with extra money. Overall I'm sure this is every building, but it's shit."
1989,JOEL AND DIANE CHAUVIN,WINDSOR,"These two are something, won't update anything in the house, use intimidation and fear tactics with every aspect of renting and they act like they are holier than thou all the time, they are rich you are poor, they own many rentals and own them all. The place I rented was old and falling apart and they wanted to act like it was a castle in pristine condition."
1990,ALAN CASSTEBAN,OSHAWA,Not professional. Does not maintain property. Runs a credit check every few months lowering your score.
1991,2525658 ONTARIO INC,TORONTO,"Pest issues throughout building, cockroaches.  Landlord has not updated the building over the years.  I only give credit for following rent control laws.  Horrible building representative with no customer service skills and the property manager is even worse,"
1992,HILLARY LEE STONERIDGE PROPERTY,OSHAWA,Constantly finding excuses to enter the units they rent. Repairs are done by themselves instead of hiring professionals. This causes more damage than what was started with. Absolute refusal to do yard maintenance. Mold growing in the homes with no rectifying the situation only blaming the tenants.
1993,STERLING KARAMAR,TORONTO,"Nothing ever gets fixed, and if it does it will last for 2 days before it doesn't work again. Parking lot always gets flooded. Elevator never works. Parking is brutal with people blocking driveways. Snow removal is a joke. Laundromat is a joke."
1994,HOMESTARTS,SCARBOROUGH,"Lack professionalism 
Treat tenants poorly 
Fail to adhere to bi laws"
1995,VICTORIA PARK HOLMES,WATERDOWN,"Victoria park Holmes hires slum lords with D.U.I’s that have narcissistic, jealous, powering tripping and bulling tendencies who discriminate and break all the human rights codes. I currently live in waterdown and am in court right now and there evicting my wife and 11 year old daughter for a noise complaint. My wife is on disability and her service animal has cancer and her face is falling apart it’s horrible and they gave us a week too move out it’s disgusting. There using an anti social tenant who lives below us too lie and say we’re monsters and non stop make grinding and hammer drilling noises! Which isn’t true at all but the LTD is there bitch and do whatever they want. If we get evicted this story is being brought too the news and too human rights hope they don’t have there hands in there pockets as well. Reuben deemer/ Julia lovas"
1996,LUCAN ARNETT,PETERBOROUGH,"Lucan is the best landlord I have ever had. If you have a problem, he is always on it, if he can’t fix it, he will get someone who can. He is very approachable. We have total privacy. 
I highly recommend renting from him in the Peterborough area if given the chance"
1997,HILLBURN APARTMENTS,SCARBOROUGH,Repairs are not done in a timely manner or never at all. One has to adjust on how to live in an apartment that’s falling.
1998,SHAUNA DORCIN,HAMILTON,The building at 1365 limeridge road east in Hamilton is a co op. It's ran by members of the building and these members have been attacking others and harrassing people with eviction notices. Loud parties are always errupting and the cop killer from Haldimand was living here recently until he was caught for his crimes. The people in this building will harrass you if they don't like you and run you out if your home! Steer clear!
1999,GWL REALTY ADVISORS,TORONTO,The Livmore High Park - They been applying over 11% in rent increase for residents!
2000,KEN EYRE KPM RENTALS,YORK,"The apartments are filled with mold, rats, roaches, millipedes, toilet bugs. Someone always shot in the area. No working cameras. The laundry is a hot mess. Bare flies that pitch everywhere. Neighbour's always yelling. Landlord doesn't care when issues reported to him. He would rather shave a door down than replace it. Multiple break ins because the lower floors don't have screens or locks for their windows. The landlord takes 3-6 months to fix something I can google and fix in 2 mins. Which I shouldn't have to do because it's their responsibility to give a working and safe apartment. You only get new appliances when new people move in.  Unfair rental practices and the LTB doesn't care about mold they only care that you pay your rent. Do not move here. If you can move anywhere else. 85 Clearview Heights is the absolute worst!"
2001,ALI MALEKI,TORONTO,"the worst landlord i have ever had. he was threatening, and even tried to breakdown the basement apartment door screaming he was foing to kill the tenant, we had to call the cops to have them come and arrest him! he continued to do crazy things like cut the city metal bicycle spots with a chainsaw, smashed the outside patio set of my neighbour and evicted me after being there only 6 months saying he wanted to taise the rent by $500. i mentioned thats not legal... and he said he can do what he wants and if i tried to fight it he would make me regret it. the apartment was also a disaster, everything broke, he would disconnect the hot water... do not live there!!"
2002,MJM INVESTMENTS INC,MISSISSAUGA,"Landlords enter apartment without permission. Sometimes when you're home, and in bed. Mold in the windows, bathrooms, hallways. And when asked to repair something,. You are scolded. And told you to leave if you don't like it.
Rent is way too high, and landlords are beyond horrible.
Rent a unit in this place, at your own risk."
2003,TERRI FRANK,TORONTO,"Terri is the beat landlord i have ever had, she is quick to fix any issue, never pressured me during the pandemic and even dropped rent during it to help all her tenants."
2004,COGIR,TORONTO,Getting worse yer by year
2005,STEVE GENG,HAMILTON,"I have rented off Steve Geng for nine years. He has been the best most transparent landlord I’ve ever had. He does a lot of repairs himself or out sources to people he trusts , haven’t had an issue. Didn’t raise my rent for five years . answers almost right away , if not the next day.
 purchases things for the home when they need on a timely basis, offers me things to help with rodent issues. Also pays for exterminator yearly as this is a 160 year old home . They come se ask my to check unless asked . He is so Thoughtful , Christmas gifts  checking up on you etc . 
Steve is just very very very awesome. I couldn’t say it better."
2006,CHERISHOME LIVING,TORONTO,"If you like dirty buildings, zero maintenance or repairs, no hot water, no heat in the winter and attitude from the staff if you ask for anything this is the place for you!!!! Save your money and look elsewhere! Buildings are falling apart and the owner only cares about the rent checks! Their buildings would never pass inspection but somehow they must?! Renter BEWARE!!!!!"
2007,NENGFA LIU (FRANK),RICHMOND HILL,"Horrible landlord! He renovicted us last year. Put my children at risk and even tried to sell me the property while evicting us. Then changed his story saying his daughter was moving in. Whatever agreement he signs, he finds a way out of by threatening his lawyer on you. Avoid this guy at all costs!"
2008,PAUL,TORONTO,"This landlord does not care about you. Nothing will get fixed unless it affects his house directly.

There was mold and he just said it was normal


After giving notice he would just enter the unit without notice.

I would not rent from him"
2009,736923 ONTARIO LIMITED,TORONTO,"Not happy with a landlord and maintenance, smells drugs and smoke everywhere. Washing machines are covered with dog poop, disgusting and rent has been increased since I came here many times. Because of rocket high house prices, I couldn't afford to buy a house anytime soon."
2010,CHERISHOME LIVING FORMERLY MCARTHUR PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"If I could give zero stars I would!!! Stay away from this property rental company!! They do absolutely nothing in their buildings. Tenants suffer from no heat, no hot water, very dirty buildings, no maintenance and good luck thinking they actually care enough to help! They gladly take your money to get rich and make you live like trash!!! Living here is really not much better than living on the streets!!! Beware!!!!!!"
2011,AMIR KLEIN (AAK GROUP),CAMBRIDGE,"Amir has been a great landlord who always treated us with respect. When something broke, he was always quick to replace it or fix it. The property is well-maintained and always kept clean. It's been a great experience renting from Amir. Rent has been reasonable and our apartment has served us well. We strongly recommend renting from Amir for anyone who is looking for a place in Cambridge (Galt)."
2012,IPG MANAGEMENT GROUP,TORONTO,"These people are stunningly incompetent and dishonest.  They have been the property managers at my apartment building for the last year and have failed miserably to meet their obligations to tenants.  No heat for months despite knowing of boiler issue months in advance; unnecessarily protracted repairs resulting in significant disruption, inconvenience and loss of privacy; refusal to replace broken ceramic floor tiles and broken kitchen faucet; refusal to repair broken window during winter months (with snow blowing in); refusal to provide rent abatement (discount/refund) when flooring was torn up for weeks with contractors coming in and out several times a day for weeks on end; making BS excuses (such as no money) for not completing repairs, etc."
2013,CHAO KAI LIN,MARKHAM,"Great landlord one of the best I've had.  He fixed any issues we had immediately, though he lived in London ON, he would send help, or just ask for the repair bill from a contractor if something came up. He was always very responsive to my questions, and he kept the property in good order."
2014,AYLMER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT/ESCALADE PROPERTIES,TILLSONBURG,Honestly the worst landlords out there. The price of rent for the space you’re getting is outrageous! Plus it apparently takes them 10 months to fix a washing machine.
2015,MELITA CULL,HAMILTON,"Ignored a basement that floods, now filled with mold. A foundation that's crumbling, a house that's literally sinking by the day, appliances that dont work. Instead of doing the repairs issues bad faith N12. Instead of waiting for a hearing at the LTB, she decided to break into my home, destroyed my belongings, boarded up the doors and windows and changed the locks, while I was away. It took police intervention to get back in. In the end, I was awarded $30,000 for illegal actions, but it was an 8 months battle. She owns multiple rental homes in Hamilton. Speaking with other tenants of hers, she plays this game with everyone. Beware!"
2016,KING STREET HOLDINGS,KITCHENER,Landlords take months to fix any issues. They ignore the repeat calls about issues that arise with other tenants. They never give 24 hours notice before entering the person's dewealing. They don't care if items are stolen.
2017,MEERA KANDEEPAN,TORONTO,"Bare minimum repairs, only fixes things that could cause immediate damage to the property. No maintenance activities except for the bare minimum furnace system checks. 

Will do anything to get you out if you pay below market rate. Do not assume she is following the law. Risk for being coerced to move without following legal process."
2018,COGIR REAL ESTATE,ETOBICOKE,"Worst landlord in canadian history. No repair on time, no superintendent office, no management contact details to communicate regarding complain. All building tenant are frustrated"
2019,NORTH EDGE PROPERTIES,ETOBICOKE,"We Lost hundreds of parking spots because part of the property was sold/leased to a developer and new a condo is being built there. The building is infested with cockroaches and ticks, mice as well. We get building wide water shut down weekly plus additional emergency water shut downs. Stay away from this building at all cost! You have been warned"
2020,ANTHONY KOZIOL,NORTH BAY,Worst slumlord in North Bay. Property is filthy. Landlord allows drug dealers to operate openly out of the property and also hosts a busy bicycle-stealing ring that chops the stolen bikes right in the courtyard. It's not safe and he doesn't care.
2021,AMR,BARRIE,"Slumlords at their finest, will do everything in their power to avoid repairs. Illegal entry, you name it. Stay far away."
2022,MEDALLION CORPORATION,HAMILTON,"Bold Street apartments horrible horrible place to live.  Building is infested with cockroaches, mice and bed bugs.  Slum landlords who minimally maintain the building. Stay clear"

And still trying to illegially evict!"
2025,YONG FENG,MISSISSAUGA,Terrible people who only care about money and themselves. Frequently skirt the law.
2026,KIM KOZIK,FORT FRANCES,"Landlord took forever to do any required repairs. My oven was broken for 6+ months before he came and properly fixed it. He also stated he did snow removal however it would be 7pm before he ever came and did it. The lady who rented below me had a water pipe burst in her apartment and he did not respond to her messages for 2 days and then was angry she had called a plumber herself.  Otherwise he was mostly respectful of our space, never showed up unannounced and gave required notice prior to inspections."
2027,TERRI LYNE HUTCHINSON,WASAGA BEACH,"Terri Lyne has several last names. Allen, Carlson and Hutchinson. 
When we seen the place and signed the lease, we discussed what would be included in the rental and signed the agreement, gave an illegal damage deposit, plus first and last assuming we were getting everything included in the lease and what was shown us.  Throughout the year that we rented her place at Bells Park Rd she constantly texted and called to talk unprofessionally about her personal issues or ask questions about the apartment. She went back and forth on things that were included in the rental, for example, the washer and dryer use was in the lease and several times she took the use away for unreasonable excuses, the use of the backyard was in the lease given we got liability insurance to cover things as there was a pool and firepit back there (which is completely fine and understandable) It seems she forgot our agreement and insurance she required us to obtain, and told us we couldn't use the back yard due to liability and chained it off.   In the agreement we agreed every 6 months to have a walk through of the apartment to check fire alarms and the condition of the apartment (which no issue there). But she made reasons to enter the apartment once a month, if not more.  We had zero privacy in the unit. She made us feel like unwanted house guests more so than tenants over paying for a small 2 bedroom apartment. 
When I announced I was pregnant she wanted to charge my 2 year old daughter and unborn baby extra utilities since there were going to more people in the unit, and when we refused she tried to hike up the rent. When we threw the Ontario rent increase laws at her she decided to take away the washer and dryer use completely and became very cold and hard to deal with. 
The one good thing about her I will mention is that she loves and takes pride in her home so any repairs that needed to be done she was right on top of them in record time. That part was awesome and appreciated. 
When we gave our notice, she wrote us a letter of recommendation for our applications as we took care of her place very well.. But when they called her she had nothing but bad things to say about us costing us to loose several houses we pretty much had. 
She had us give an illegal damage deposit because we have a dog and a child, but when we moved out she ignored our request for it back, and has also not paid her portion of utilities for the last 2 months as they were required to be put in our name while living there.  She isn't responding to our calls, texts or emails. 
Renters beware. Super unprofessional landlord. 
She has a victim mentality and everyone has done her wrong and owes her. She doesn't respect the landlord tenant laws in Ontario."
2028,DYLAN MCLAUCHLAN,LONDON,"Dylan was a great landlord, easy to reach and quick to respond. He was respectful and managed his property well"
2029,JAGINDER SOOMAL,CAMBRIDGE,Tried to get a tenant to sign an illegal document that said they moved in 3 months ago when they moved in 11 years ago. This was done because they sued him for breaking a foot on his property when he didn’t fix a whole in the ground outside. He says he wanted the apartment so his daughter could move in but would let them stay and kick out another tenant if they signed the document and agreed to pay market rate for rent which was over $700 more each month. The building is under rent control. They didn’t sign the document. We’ll see what he tries next.
2030,BARB OTTO,CAMBRIDGE,"Barb Otto at ******* in Cambridge accepts cash only and refuses to provide receipts . She will not use a standard lease form. 

Both her and her husband live in the main house and they rent out units above the garage and in the basement. They don’t fix serious safety issues. They show up at my door multiple nights per week wanting to come inside. 

They will refuse to fix simple things and then blame you when you become injured. Please stay away. "
2031,SKYLINE LIVING,LONDON,"Parkdale Tower is an older building. Quite a few common areas need updating, like carpets, walls and paint in hallways. It is a non-smoking building as of 2018, but there are quite a few tennants that predate that and smoke in their units. Windows open on a nice day means you'll get a nice wiff of tobacco or marijuana smoke. Heat is by boiler and is not controllable in the units. Too hot most of the fall winter and spring and you'll have to have all the windows open. 25 degrees outside, yep the heat is still on. That being said, the building is well maintained for the most part and the units are nice inside. The superintendent and assistant are pleasant to deal with and take their job seriously."
2032,GUARDIAN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT/WILLIAM SEIP,KITCHENER-WATERLOO,"Poor response time, little notice of repair work disruptions such as water being turned off to the building. Long term low income tenants being ""renovicted"" now that Covid is over, so he can jack up rents. Won't fix expensive issues like leaking drafty windows, but puts granite counters in to charge more for a 'luxery' unit. Large staff turnover, can't keep a handyman for longer than 2 years., won't pay for a superintendent."
2033,RYAN CURZON,TORONTO,"Ryan Curzon knows not the first thing about being even a half decent landlord. He's spiteful, lazy and thinks that threatening others and ignoring real issues will make them disappear. He's a nightmare to deal with and although fails miserably, tries to use his sexuality as a way manipulate and belittle others. Do yourself a favour, your hard earned money is better suited far, far away from this drama queen."
2034,DAN MCAULEY,BELLEVILLE,Dan owns numerous properties in the Quinte area. Both commercial and residential. I have a residential unit. He has been very good to deal with overall. Responsive when messaged. Helpful when needed. Respectful and mostly takes care of his properties. My rating is positive.
2035,ROGER LAMOUREAUX,SUDBURY,I have an amazing landlord. Anything that needs to be done is always done promptly. The rent he charges is also wonderful. It's not expensive.
2036,SKYLINE,FERGUS,"The building I lived in was an old building but very well maintained.  It was owned by Balnar Properties.  They were working on gutting each apartment and making them new again.  My apartment was beautiful.  The rent was reasonable and most of all we could pay EMT which allowed me to pay bi-weekly (always half a month ahead).  They were fine with this and always got rent on time.  When the snow fell, we got a notice immediately to clear out by next day to clear the snow.  Management would go out and shovel in the interm. I couldn't speak more highly about Balnar and the way they took care of tenants.
Skyline bought my building and several others in the community.  I can say everything did a 180.  Opposite to Balnar treatment.  Now rent was auto withdrawal only, No snow clearance, tenants (including disabled and seniors) were told to maintain there own parking space.  apartments had an ""as needed"" approach to them.  When the building would have repairs, like a roof, the tenants were billed for it in a rent increase.  When tenants moved out and new moved in the bare minimum was done.  My friend moved into a Skyline apartment with 4 or 5 different floors, and floors had chunks out of them still.  When you filed a grievance, it took months to be addressed.  When something needed fixed, again weeks to months to be fixed.  A fellow tenants toilet broke.  They handed her a bucket and said use this til its fixed.  They are a greedy money making business who couldn't give 2 shits about humans living in there building.  The increases on rent for the buildings, added hydro and parking costs, now have made simple apartment living impossible even charging upwards to 1800 for a bachelor. Shame Skyline, Shame!!!!"
2037,CLARIDGE HOMES,OTTAWA,Not a bad experience at Claridge Onyx in Centretown. The building opened in summer 2019 and I moved in 2020. The building manager has changed a few times and the latest one is a bit of a dick. But overall I’m happy living here.
2038,SYLVIE MARTIN,SUDBURY,Awesome landlord! 5 star rating!
2039,RHAG,TORONTO,"Never come to do checks 
Do not repair well"
2040,CONRAD MENARD,ALEXANDRIA,"He enters apt when he wants , also sends in his workers without letting tenant know. Anything that goes wrong is always tenants fault.  He’s controlling , narcissistic and dangerous. Many don’t get last months rent back"
2041,RIVERPARK HOLDINGS,ETOBICOKE,A better landscaping contract and better care for our very old floor would be great
2042,VINCENZO SCARPINO,NORTH YORK,This landlord is a bully and collects fund for improvements but not done.
2043,SHASHI SHARMA,LONDON,"Our family of 5 rented a house from Shashi in London, On. She was extremely disrespectful, did not respect our privacy or have basic decency. She didn’t give proper notice and required to view the house almost any time she visited London, sometimes giving us a hard time with the 24hr notice rule. We lived there for a year and she viewed the house 6+ times. Wouldn’t let us have a blow up pool, and wouldn’t remove the mouldy carpet from the basement when it flooded. In addition, she required an illegal pet deposit on top of first and last months rent. Needless to say, she did not give the deposit back even though our dog did no damage. We put a ton of work into her house and yard and it looked way better than when we moved in. We even had to fight to have railings put on the deck she installed so our kids didn’t fall off and hurt themselves. 
Beware- She’s money hungry with little to no decency."
2044,LANKIN LIVING (DRAKE PROPERTIES),GREATER TORONTO AREA,"Always fails to Communicate,"
2045,THE GRAND TRILLIUM CORPORATION,TORONTO,"Extremely Bad management
worst in the history"
2046,CHASE HARDER,TORONTO,"I stayed with chase in the den room early during the pandemic. He accommodated me for the situation i was in, and had reaonable prices."
2047,LINDA FUNG,TORONTO,Linda was my landlord from 2014-2018 and I had a good experience. She is very responsive and respects your privacy. I experienced extensive flooding in my unit and she made sure I was comfortable and taken care of when it happened. Only nice things to say.
2048,TIANFANG HE,OSHAWA,"This married landlord team is exceptional. They fix anything we ask in a timely manner. If it is something we can do, and we request we do it, they will purchase the item and everything needed for it. 
They respect our privacy. 

They only had to up the rent a few times. We have been here for 6 years and they don't do it unless absolutely necessary. Unfortunately,  the rent in Oshawa is ridiculous but they are very fair!"
2049,ELANA PICONNE,HAWKESBURY,"In the 3 years that I lived in this place the mold grew in the floors of the living area due to the roof leaking, a family of raccoons lived in my walls for 6 months and they did no repairs after they had them removed. The only repair that was done in the house was the pipes after a tenant underneath me throws the pipes in the winter and caused my washer to overflow. They came onto my property without my permission and stole my lawn mower and killed my garden"
2050,OGILVIE GARDENS/THE SILVER GARDENS GROUP,GLOUCESTER,"Unfortunately, the people that are being hired into the office are not nice. They are rude and lack of customer service skills. I hate going to their office.
They need to do better."
2051,WJ PROPERTIES 2560 KINGSTON ROAD,SCARBOROUGH,"Not a clean building, soon as your moved in your furniture will be infested with roaches if not bed bugs. They make the common areas look clean but it isn’t."
2052,"WILLIAM (BILL) MANDELBAUM, BUCKINGHAM PROPERTIES",TORONTO,"Would literally give him 0 if I could. He's what the general population refer to as ""scumlord"" and is the absolute WORST of the WORST. Him and his lover/agent Rodica Iliescu are simply sad and poor excuses for human beings. Avoid at ALL costs."
2053,EFFORT TRUST,HAMILTON,"No superintendents, constructive rentovictions,  can't get repairs done unless its something thats likely to cost them big, cockroaches and bedbugs, total disrespect about what their negligence is costing tenants and don't under any circumstances ever give them access to pre authorized payments in your bank account as when they take your rent out twice and stuff doesn't clear because of their error it's totally your problem. Trying to get heat at the start of fall and end of winter. The list keeps going on and on."
2054,SEAN MOORE,TORONTO,"Sean was an excellent landlord. He respected our privacy as tenants during the application process and after moving into the space. He did not ask for an excessive amount of documentation to prove that we were qualified tenants. 

The actual space was recently updated and well done throughout. Any repairs that were needed were quick to be attended to.

Easily one of the easiest, kindest, and best landlords I have dealt with in my time."
2055,DUPUIS PROPERTIES,NORTH BAY,Absolutely horrible! They won’t fix mold or leaks.. they don’t answer their phones when you need them.. over priced.
2056,PIONEER APARTMENTS,KITCHENER,"The base rent increase of over 100% in the past 8 years tells me the property wants to be considered ""high class"" but the lack of investment into the property in that time shows it's still low income/student housing.

- Cockroaches
- Broken infrastructure
- leaks
- constant plumbing issues
- mismanagement (constantly losing paperwork) and constantly changing building managers
- pot holes in the parking lot.

2K for 2 bedroom and 1.7K for a one bedroom? I feel bad for new tenants."
2057,WJ PROPERTIES,TORONTO,Hal treats people like second class citizens.  He talks down to you like you know absolutely nothing about anything.  He has ordered a 2nd round of balcony repairs in 7 years since the last one for the opposite side of the building and he will jack up the rent again.  I'm not even affected by this balcony fix because my balcony didn't need fixing and I'll end up having to pay for it.
2058,PANORAMIC PROPERTIES,SUDBURY,"They don’t do enough maintenance, it’s dangerous in the winter and smoke detectors haven’t been checked in years"
2059,CHUCK,AURORA,"Did not want to repair when the lady upstairs flooded her toilet .. mold has grown an smells like mold needs another of repairs an updates , get freezing cold unless you have portable heater ,"
2060,GREENWIN (OWNED BY STARLIGHT),KITCHENER,"The absolute worst company to rent with in any city. They are cheap, do not invest in buildings properly, and overlook serious building issues. They are focused on renovating and evicting as many tenants/units as possible. Their buildings have all assortments of bugs, ants, cockroaches, and bed bugs are common to find. They allow building to collapse in on themselves before taking action. Cheap, unreliable and sketchy company overall."
2061,3125 QUEEN FREDERICA HOLDINGS LTD,MISSISSAUGA,"LTB actions are still ongoing. They try to increase the rent above what is allowed, and just hope that it will go unnoticed. At the same time, they are very slow to do any repairs or maintenance on existing rental units. They prefer to overhaul an apartment only after a renter moves out, so they can get more money for the apartment. Once it is rented though, good luck having any work done."
2062,MORGAN LITTLE,SUDBURY,"Illegal building, not registered with City as having multiple units. Have four seperate households in the building but it is registered as a single family dwelling. This causes a massive issue with garbage pickup as a single family dwelling is only allowed two bags of garbage every other week. With four households, we should be allowed to have 8 bags of garbage. Unfortunately the city refuses to pick up, which has caused an unsanitary amount of waste left behind which then gets strewn all over because animals get into it. 

Additionally, the basement is full of mould and the unit is extremely overpriced for a studio."
2063,"BRIAN WAI-YAN WU, CANDY WANG, ETHAN WU, EVAN WU",TORONTO,"The landlords haven't given a crap about this building at 122 Spencer Avenue since they bought it. The property is managed by Castlehill who are bargain-basement and do as little as possible. They didn't shovel the parking at first so for an entire winter cars were getting stuck and spinning out just outside my bedroom window at all hours and the walkways weren't clear, though the sidewalk would be. They didn't take out the garbage for the first 6mos so we had a neighbourhood garbage dump beside the house. More recently, they let me live with a broken fridge for 6 weeks, they messed with my electricity for 6mos last year, they haven't cleaned the hallway or foyer for about a year, and the lawn was strewn with garbage for 6mos. The garbage sometimes isn't even collected from the curb, and the garbage area is a mess. There was a broken bottle on the front walk that had fallen from a balcony and it was there for 3 weeks. They might give 24hrs notice of entry, and one year alone they gave notice 12 times. When they gave rent increase notices they asked for an illegal ""one-time top up remittance"" to keep the last month's rent even with first month's even though it's contrary to the Rental Tenancy Act. They took a neighbour to the tribunal for a ""personal use"" application and just bought them out ahead of the trial so there would be no record of it, and now they're trying to kick out another long-time tenant for ""personal use"" even though four units were open a couple months before they got their notice. Absolute garbage people."
2064,COGIR,NORTH YORK,The worst and most dangerous Property Management Company.
2065,MARTA COSTA (GREENWIN),KITCHENER,"Marta Costa is the building rep for our Greenwin buildings here in KW. She is a massive pain to deal with and does not care about tenants. Her goal is to evict as many old tenants as possible. She overlooks important safety and health issues in apartments such as mould, massive cracking in the walls, ants and cockroaches."
2066,TOSCANI DEVELOPMENTS LTD,HAMILTON,"We lived in this stacked townhome at 6 sirente drive with landlord Gino Toscani for 3 years. We were impeccable tenants. Over those three years, it became a slum of sorts with unrepaired issues, bugs, and lots of garbage on the street in an unmanageable way. Once we gave notice, the landlord illegally entered our unit multiple times when we were not home, beginning repairs before we were out and we actually won a hearing with the landlord tenant board for his illegal entry and occupation of our space before our lease had ended. Would not recommend. 0/10 stars for this place."
2067,LIUNA DMS,HAMILTON,"I send many picture to property manager about my concern flood on the survey when it’s pouring rain, the picture of park been damage by children, I send it to the property manager by email  and all I get for an answer is why you sending this picture to me, I wish common sense will kick in."
2068,ASFAND SULEMAN,BRESLAU,Amazing Landlord. Totally recomendable.
2069,MATT AND MINDY LEDUC,AJAX,full of mold destroying some of my furniture clothes had to buy all new kitchen stuff ..new couch reported all the mold to them many times we were told to clean it they also advertised it as a 3 bedroom when it was 2 plus Den..

2071,MACDANE GROUP,LONDON,"The office managers are friends with tenants and discuss confidential matters about other tenants. They take photos without consent.
Stay far away!!!!"
2072,RAJ,BRAMPTON,I’ve be in my house for 10 years cause my landlord takes care of any issues or in 10 years my rent has only increased $600 and he’s very respectful I’m also a contractor so if i ever want to do any upgrades to the house he buys the materials and I do the upgrades he’s offers me money but I never take it because it’s for the enjoyment of me and my family
2073,RAFAL ZALEWSKI,TORONTO,"Great, attentive landlord. Went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and everything was ok. Lives upstairs with his family. They were a bit loud sometimes and (naturally) he's around the property a lot. Furnace/water heater is in the unit so he needed to access the unit often. Always asked first though.
Chatty, friendly, best landlord I've had so far!"
2074,SANDEEP SHARMA,WELLAND,"Sandeep has been absolutely amazing really sorta hands off approach, very communicative and super helpful! Lovem"
2075,HELEN ZERAY,KITCHENER,"She's a realtor and bought the house we had rented from the previous owners for 10 years. She N12'ed us and another tenant saying she was converting the house (which had three apartment units) back into a single dwelling unit for her family. She lied and it was deliberate. Entire house was renovated into more rental units at a significantly higher cost. Because we had bought a house instead of rented again we had no legal recourse (because, apparently, the law in Ontario is written to protect the owner class and is rubber stamping the conversion of affordable rental units into unaffordable - we paid $915, new tenants in our unit are paying $2000!!). Helen Zeray is a terrible landlord who lies and converts affordable rentals into unaffordable rentals. Do not accept N12s from her, they are in bad faith."
2076,RLVNORTH,WATERLOO,rlvnorth is an awful person and landlord. Grrrr landlords make me so angry. LanDLeeChes I call them har dee har har
2077,ZHILONG WU,KANATA,"While Zhilong and his wife Yafang are somewhat easy to work with, they showed up a few times unannounced and were pretty uptight. What was most problematic was that they requested to increase our rent by $600 dollars and if we didn’t agree they would move their son into the house or sell. This is despite the fact that they called us many times ‘their best tenets’ and thanked us numerous times for taking such great care of their house. This went on for five months until we opted to move somewhere else. I would not rent with them again."
2078,OTTAWA SAFETY COUNCIL,OTTAWA,"They should change all the windows, and the balconies' door since they are not well sealed and cold air can enter through them. There are also some openings on the wall allowing cold air to seep through."
2079,VALERY PROPERTIES,HAMILTON,"They take forever to do repairs, could be waiting for over 2-3 year's."
2080,MEDALLION INC,OSHAWA,"Property management shows favouritism towards certain tenants. There are people who get everything done, great repairs and their apartment upgrades where as others are basically told do it themselves. It’s been “ snowing “ under my patio door for 5 yrs now- my maintenance request that the threshold rotted and fell off is still waiting to be “ repaired “ . My kitchen cupboards are unusable from a building flood back in 2014 - still waiting. When they do come and do repairs it usually causes a bigger problem than what the original repair was ( ie : they needed access to kitchen pipes so they drilled a whole in the back of the kitchen cupboards- to repair the damage they caused- it was fixed with a piece of garbage bag and gorilla tape."
2081,NEW SPADINA GARMENT INDUSTRY CORPORATION,TORONTO,"This management company have absolutely no customer service skills. They are rude, and disrespectful. They installed hidden cameras in places without letting tenants know
Repairs are not done
They hired a tenant to spy on other tenants and report back to them and just overall a bad management company"
2082,CAPREIT,TORONTO,"Ongoing low-frequency noise from a furnace installed on the upper floors since 2021. The problem with stationary noise is NOT resolved, ""to complete your service request, we need a bit more time."" No space in lockers past seven years. Pure air vents. No heat control. No AC. The heating is on when +25C is outside."
2083,SAM FURFARO,NEWMARKET,"Have been renting the whole house since 2005. Sam is easy to talk to, quick to fix things and a genuinely a nice guy. Would recommend him to anyone. I know there are so many nightmare landlords out there, but there are some really good ones as well."
2084,JOHN ATTRIDGE,COLLINGWOOD,John and Judy Attridge whom own 277 Maple St and other rental properties in Collingwood Ontario are slum lords. They will enter your unit without permission or 24hrs notice. They will threaten people who park in a parking spot. They have mold in the walls and recently painted over stuff to make it look better but didnt tackle the actual problem. Stay away from John and Judy Attridge and their family members
2085,JON OSBORNE,GRAVENHURST,Easy to deal with.  Answers quickly. Shows pride of ownership.
2086,Q RESIDENTIAL,TORONTO,"This company has the worst staff, you put in a repair and they come and say they will do something and 3 months later nothing, the building is rarely cleaned and the washing machines have been broke for at least 2 months now. The superintendent are not really friendly and hardly ever seen"
2087,MUHAMMAD ASIM ABASS,ANCASTER,"His house is falling apart, and in the end he will blame you for it! His basement is leaking and full of mould! He will only fix things if it’s free, or someone unqualified off Kijiji will come and do it for as cheap as possible so it doesn’t get fixed properly. He will enter the home without your knowledge. He is only in it for your money! Do not do business with this man! He is a crook and will try and hold your deposit and last months rent."
2088,RUDY ARCI,TORONTO,Rude and disrespectful when things don't go his way.
2089,740326 ONTARIO LIMITED,TORONTO,"When I first moved into my place everything looked fine from afar. As I moved in I realized that they didn’t bother cleaning the place before my move in date.  The person before me clearly smoked because I was cleaning black smoke off my windows and walls. The oven was disgusting, and the radiators had 20 years worth of junk and dust in and around them. When I asked for a cleaner they said no. She also mentioned that the woman down the hall “smokes once in a while and you may see a mouse here and there” (this is a nice place in the east end). Well turns out the woman smoked all day every day in her apartment and although I never saw a mouse I’d gladly taken that over the Jurassic Park sized centipedes, spiders and BEETLES I had to deal with. They also will nickel and dime you over everything. They see you as a number not as a human being. "
2090,GREENWIN (HIGHLAND SQUARE),KITCHENER,"They are not responsive to service tickets, the garage is sketchy and has had break-ins. They tote it as a luxury rental but it only has the price of one. the door to enter the parking lot from the apartment is not accessible; if you are elderly, short or just carrying things in both hands you can't open the door by design. The place is mid, avoid it if you can."
2091,LEANNE BARR,THUNDER BAY,"Difficult, ignorant of landlord tenant laws. Property in constant state of disrepair"
2092,DEVONSHIRE PROPERTIES,MISSISSAUGA,"Never had an issue in the 1201 Walden Circle apartments that wasn't fixed within a reasonable amount of time. There was always someone in the office during office hours, the fire alarms and such were maintained regularly, as were the hallways and windows of the units. They followed every guideline for notice to enter the apartment, and even provided cheques for the interest on your last month's deposit yearly.
It's shocking how much rent has gone up since I left 4 years ago, but that's just the entire province at this point."
2093,MIKE ABDELMALAK,GUELPG,Had a mouse infestation he refused to pay for and refused to reimburse for. Raised rent by $200 dollars without reason even though the one toilet did not work. Also did not fix the broken toilet.
2094,JUSTIN ROSS,GUELPH,Justin and his wife are very particular and are the type to want the rent money without having to deal with their tenants. They have also made claims to evict me without discussing their issues with me and make my roommate and I feel uncomfortable.
2095,JORDAN GUIDI,HAMILTON,"Jordan is a nice fella, renting out his basement. Rent is a bit high for what it is. It’s definitely more now that we’re gone. But overall solid fella. Although he has people over on weekends and they’re loud past midnight sometimes."
2096,MS MANDY,TORONTO,"1. The landlod didn’t tell us that her mother in law would be living in the same house upstairs. This person though takes care of cleaning and maintaining the common area/kitchen once a week(doesnt speak english). But because of that there’s no privacy in the house, she keeps roaming around the kitchen area all day. She keeps an eye what you’re cooking, keeps roaming around to shut off the lights in the kitchen all the time which is really annoying and invasion of privacy.
2. There’s coin laundry in the house which is again personally annoying for me after paying so much rent
3. There’s 4 rooms each with their own personal washrooms which is great
4. The guy living in the basement has a problem with me using the washroom at 9am in morning for some reason (sometimes any time whenever he is home)and immediately calls the landlord every single time if he can’t sleep
5. After living here I discovered that the other 2 roommates were paying much lesser rent probably because they got here during the covind period but the difference was about 25%
6. There was a ceiling leakage once during rains which the landlord got it fixed immediately
The en-suites and cleaning once a week are the only 2 good things about this place"
2097,SIMON EUTENIER,HAMILTON,Good guy overall. Kinda rude/combative on occasion. Hiked the rent for no reason when I moved out.
2098,WALNUT PLACE RESIDENCE (VRANCOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT),HAMILTON,"Brand new building but Vrancor property management is awful. I was the first person in the brand new unit and from the start the dishwasher was leaking, main door has wind noise, parking is a disaster they make u pay for parking monthly $150 for a spot but you can’t get a spot to park after work hours. My bedroom door lock is installed upside down. The balcony has bird poop that hasn’t been cleaned in years. Windows sealant or cocking was done poorly. Kitchen cabinet door bang against the light fixture on the ceiling. ceiling has a crack I filed so many complaints but they won’t do anything about it. they can’t even reduce my rent by $50. I asked to be moved to a different unit and the management messed up the rent payment structure and ended up costing me more fees and time to reverse the move. Overall experience with the property management was poor. The garage stinks inside the entire building very repulsive for a brand new building. The real estate agent market this building as an high end place but please avoid working with Matthew or Robert. They could not even complete the paperwork for the lease properly and had stranded on the move in date and instead of helping they just made lame excuse that the system they use sucks."
2099,WILL TREWIN / PAUL TREWIN,BOWMANVILLE,He's there multiple times a week. You're basically just covering the expenses for his hobby.
2100,Q RESIDENTIAL,HAMILTON,"I live in a 1bdrm apartment and have been renting for 2 years. $1200 currently. 

Mgmt at 145/165 Queen Street S are great folks at this point in time. The new staff have been responsive in replying to my concerns. (especially if more urgent). However this could change since there's been a fair amount of turnover with staff for my building during my time here.

Unfortunately once things go to Q Residential corporate, little is done in regards to non-urgent repairs. I waited 4+ months for water damage to be fixed on my wall before a subcontractor came. As well, my heat was supposed to be fixed two years ago and hasnt been fixed. All staff have been able to do is put a work order in and much doesnt happen after that. One half of baseboard heating works in my living room, so its quite cold in my unit in the winter (sometimes 16 degrees or lower). This is completely unaccetable and is a by-law violation in my city.

I'm staying here since rent is reasonable considering rental prices in Hamilton. Newly rented 1 bdrm units in my building are going for $1700 now, which is ridiculous for units with continual cockroach problems, and difficult neighbours depending on your floor. (ex: 165 Queen Street S Floor 3, has one neighbour who has been difficult). Mgmt has done alot to resolve things in this regard thankfully, but its still challenging. Mgmt has been proactive in treating my specific unit for cockroaches, but its a continual problem within the building. Other tenants have had bed bug issues, but thankfully I havent had this happen.

Most tenants living in my building are nice folks which helps balance things out considering the frustrations I've experienced here in my stay. Overall wouldnt recommend living here, mainly due to Q Residential headquarters lack of action for major repair problems, and a comprehensive pest control approach."
2101,SKYLINE LIVING,SARNIA,"These jokers buy up literally every apartment complex that they can afford in my city. They then do as many ""improvements"" to the building that they can get away with, letting you know that it could potentially cause an AGI. But they won't even tell you which capital projects they actually will apply for an AGI over, which drives me insane because I can't handle uncertainty. When they bought the place, they told us we would be grandfathered in as smoking units, then like 3 months later they tried to get all of us to sign agreements to make the entire building smoke free. I get it, SOME people don't like the smell of cigarettes or weed, but Skyline's word isn't worth anything, they will always do what will make them the most money. Their customer service is also garbage, all of their communications sound as if they were written by an AI, there is absolutely no rapport or human connection between Skyline's management and their tenants. People who think formal impersonal language is better for a business are delusional, especially when dealing with something as personal as housing. 

The four guys who founded the company are the epitome of toxic masculinity, and it's reflected in how hierarchical and bureaucratic their corporation is. Skyline is simply the manifestation of parasitical investors and their greed."
2102,CARLO SORRENTI,LONDON,"the worst landlord to ever exist. inconsiderate, rude, and ignorant."
2103,HAZELVIEW PROPERITES,LONDON,"Workers for the landlord entered my apartment without notice and were upset that I hadn’t set my place up for an inspection so they tore the cushions off my couch and left them on the floor I went into my bedroom and found my mattress flipped off my bed and on the floor — they damaged the box spring and I had to replace it. Over the course of a couple years I had a cockroach and bed bug infestation the pest control company would take over a month to come each time I made a complaint about bugs — they also didn’t seem to be spraying much of my apartment. There was no residue from spraying on a lot of my furniture and only after complaining and accusing the exterminator of not spraying did he start to treat my unit. The landlord never took responsibility for damaging my property and failing to treat the infestation nor would they provide credit to use their laundry room, which is part of the treatment for a bug infestation. Overall I probably spent 5 grand replacing furniture when I left the building. 

The building manager and his supervisor were abusive and acted like tin pot dictators when attempting to get them to actually address the issues outlined above and other issues I have not included. They filed a fraudulent n5 when I started to press them that what they had done was illegal and promptly withdrew the n5 when I easily showed I kept my apartment quite clean."
2104,PREETI THOMAS/ ISSAC THOMAS,MARKHAM,"There are so many issues with the landlords.
1. There house is filthy and infested with rats. After complaining like everyday for 3 weeks nothing they didn’t do anything.
2. There is no concern for privacy. Drunk landlord(Issac) would bang main door in the middle of the night.
3. Cleaning the common area was landlord responsibility and they never did(hired anyone) for it.
4. Internet sucks. And when I complained about it many times Issac verbally abused me. 
5. Landlords lived in Ottawa but they would randomly organize parties in their house in Markham and invite people who had no regards for tenants(drunk Indian men)
6. When we( me and another 2 tenants)decided to leave and broke the lease cause of the abuse mainly, Issac and Preeti used profanities.

So basically I won’t recommend new comers to go there. Trust me you won’t want another stupid headaches.


And there is one more thing I want to mention- Issac randomly left his mother in the house with no bed for her or food or money. She would cry all day and beg you. She doesn’t speak English and it’s difficult to understand. (I used speech to text and then converted in English) this is how I know about her story. This was the last straw I left this place within 4 days."
2105,MERAJ POURHOSSEIN,WATERLOO,"Worst landlord experience of my life. Father and son scammer duo that are not on the same page. Neither know landlord-tenant laws. Rent out their basement illegally. Half the electrical outlets in the house don’t work.

Both show up with no notice and have nothing better to do than sit in common room creepishly waiting to ambush anyone who walks in. Son smokes several substances in the common areas.

Landlord will try to force tenants to do jobs that are the the landlords responsibility, such as shovelling snow off the driveway or clearing phallic shaped graffiti left on their garage left by previous angry tenants.

Took 11 days to fix broken internet, which another tenant did. May pull internet for current month after screaming at you. Yelled at another tenant for “breaking” their old, shitty laundry machine that desperately needs a replacement. 

Will threaten your living situation constantly, try to raise rent with no notice. Both have entered my living space without permission to yell about random things.

0/10 would not recommend. Save yourself the headache and live anywhere else."
2106,DAVE FALVO,THUNDER BAY,"Honestly, Dave is by far the best landlord I’ve had dealings with my entire renting life. Anytime there’s an issue with my apartment or the building he’s right on it making sure the issues are dealt with. I have no complaints."
2107,ED (ANNEX VILLAGE),TORONTO,"Overall, I would say Ed is a fair landlord. Rental increases have always been within guidelines and the building is kept safe and clean. My main complaints with Ed as a landlord are his infrequent communications (can take a week+ for a reply to a simple email), and the time it takes for repairs to happen. I waited ~8 weeks for Ed to have someone repair my dishwasher."
2108,OLD OAK PROPERTIES,LONDON,Forest Hills Apartments by Old Oak Properties is absolutely disgusting and unsafe.
2109,AARON CLAPP,LINDSAY,"Aaron was by far the best landlord of a student house I dealt with in Lindsay. Very attentive and frequently visited the property for maintenance, etc. But respected privacy and gave lots of notice before entering rooms."
2110,CALATIS LTD,KITCHENER,"John was a great landlord. A little judgy at times, but who wouldn't be considering some of the terrible tenants he's had to deal with. Always level headed and timely with repairs. The building elevator should have been replaced long ago (it works, but is very old), but really he runs a good place."
2111,ROB HEYDON,HAMILTON,"There is no possible way I can cover a years worth of dealing with this man in a written review. In short, if you rent with this man, prepare to have a multitude of issues with the house that 1) will not be fixed and 2) you will be blamed for. Prepare for him to show up to your house with zero notice. Prepare for an absolute dump of a unit, likely infested with mice, roaches, bed bugs, or all of the above. Rob and his wife are living walking scams. Avoid at all costs."
2112,ORIANA LANGIS,OTTAWA,"The epitome of a parasitic slumlord. Just awful. Doesn't even understand the laws under which she makes profit. 

- leaves a rotten deck up so she can charge more for rent, tears it out after we move in and still raised rent the maximum amount as soon as she could. We asked her to at least remove all the nails from the deck teardown as we have a dog and didn't want them walking on old nails. She agreed, said it was done yet we still had to pick up over 170 nails ourselves, she didn't even try.

- washer and dryer were ancient and barely worked. She refused to replace and had the audacity to ask if she could store a relatively new washer/dryer in our garage while she tried to sell it (she bought new ones with the high rent we payed her for her own home and wouldn't even give us the old machines) 

- refused to pay for pest control even after I offered to pay half. Her reason was that I didn't let her know ahead of time but the only reason I didnt was because everything that was ever requested was never done so eventually you just stop asking.

-barricaded our back door so we wouldn't use it while she tore the deck down. She was scared of injuries/potential lawsuit if we used it. This is illegal (fire code reasons). She doesn't even understand the laws that govern this sort of thing.

-grossly overcharges for rent yet never ever uses any money to maintain the house.

- left a bunch of stuff in the basement cause she was too lazy to get rid of it before moving out.

-gave us grief when moving out for not cleaning even though we did. She blamed us for upsetting the new tenants when she wasn't able to set up a cleaning/painting service cause she had them moving in the same day we left as to not miss a single week of rent payments.

-everything always took far too long for no reason, she doesn't even work cause she charges so much for rent. So why does it take so long to get anything done? 

-there's more but that's the gist. Stay away!"
2113,RICHARD BRACKENBERRY,LONDON,Screwed us on rent multiple times and refused to inform/move out previous tenants  causing us to have to spend a fortune on last minute rental. Threatened and harassed us after even though we paid the deposit and never got a refund despite not being able to move in.
2114,"WA ""WINNIE"" CHEN",TORONTO,"We moved in mid COVID when rents were slightly depressed. Things were fine for about a year when rents picked back up and surprise surprise, here comes the N12 eviction.

As I mentioned, no complaints before the eviction, but if I knew in advance I wouldn't sign up to move twice in two years so I'm giving you all the heads up that this person is an N12 abuser."
2115,SPOTTED PROPERTIES,HAMILTON,"These guys suck! Every time we would call for a repair, they would send someone that didn’t know how to do the job! We had flooding for months and it took the actual landlord to step in because the property management team didn’t want to spend money on an actual plumber. The repair guys also regularly gaslit us saying “did that actually happen? I don’t see many signs of water”. And when we had a black mold problem, also gaslit is on that! Also, if we were even 1 day late on our rent, they would send relentless eviction notices! Multiple a week! Even if we paid already."
2116,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"Landlord did not want to maintain the building, do repairs or deal with problematic tenants. KW Property works extremely hard to ensure they don’t do any actual work. When you call in and actually do speak to someone they’re childish and argumentative. Their solution to any problems is to offer you one month rent back to move immediately. Terrible."
2117,LAMPE TOWERS,THORNHILL,"Terrible place to live. Stay far away

The building is absolutely infested with bedbugs, or at least the 3rd floor is.

Every few months there are random 'inspections' (because they KNOW they will find them) followed by a completely pointless and ineffectual chemical spray. New neighbours moving in would inevitably get them too after just a few weeks, and since units are only treated one at a time to save money (instead of quarantining the floor/building like you are supposed to) the bugs just move around as they're driven from one apartment to another.

They also engage in illegal rent increases through sneaky means. I was told the garage was to be renovated, with my parking spot temporarily moved outside. When renovations were 'finished', I was not informed. Then had my fees jacked way up after asking to move back inside. 

Terrible bookkeeping as well -- we would frequently get eviction notices for non-payment of rent EVEN WHEN WE PAID IN FULL. We would have to go through the entire ordeal of contacting a paralegal and going through the tenant board only for them to block it (obviously, since we paid!). 

We ended up moving away because we could not afford the legal fees that would have been required to fight it all.

Terrible landlord, terrible property managers, terrible building."
2118,SUSHEELA BARU,WATERLOO,"Ms. Baru seemed to be extremely distrustful as a landlord, believing from the offset that there would be trouble with us as tenants based on her opinion of previous tenants. She even claimed that she would withhold our legal last month rent deposit as a damage deposit illegally. 

Throughout our rental period, Ms Baru exercised her right to have the house reassessed for sale, though she kept maintaining that she would not sell and displace us. We believe that she did try to illegally evict us by claiming that an above allowance rent increase was necessary to cover her carrying costs, and that should we be unable to pay she would have to let one of her children live there. She did eventually back down once we asked her to send the correct notices. 

Overall, Ms Baru was very hands-off except in cases where she seemed to want to cash in on her property. I would not recommend her as a landlord and believe that she charges too much for the property."
2119,PIERRE SIROIS,OTTAWA,"Lazy landlord that just wants the money but not the responsibility of providing housing and dealing with people. Pierre and his brother Nick will ignore you once they are annoyed with whatever reason you are contacting them, regardless if it is a positive thing.

They send mass emails with all their tenants in the whole building’s information in it. Completely disregarding your privacy.

They try to scam you by over-charging for water usage and keep “forgetting” to send you the bill from the city. They won’t fix your broken washing machine and try to convince you that you have to pay for it. They won’t take care of the hallways or garbage. They insist garbage must be taken out by everyone with a giant bin in the back. Expecting you to lug 20 black garbage bags out from the backyard to the front yard each garbage day by yourself for the whole building because no one else will do it even though it’s the landlord’s responsibility. These clowns tried to raise rent without providing proper notice. They also only have one parking spot but try to fit 2 cars in it and it doesn’t work because it’s too small. These guys are a pain in the ass to get anything done.

On top of this,  the whole neighbourhood hates them for harassing the next door neighbours and putting nails in their car tires. 
Additionally, these idiots have a set court date for harassing their previous tenants who are lesbians by stalking them, adding cameras in the hallway pointing directly at their unit, telling them to remove their pride flag, following them to work,  etc.

Creepy and unprofessional. Stay away."
2120,BLUESTONE PROPERTIES,LONDON,They are very good at maintaining the property and attend to service requests very quickly. They don't charge any additional fees or hidden fees. Been living in their buildings for 5 years now. No complaints at all.
2121,RAMDEO RAMTAHAL,WATERLOO,"The Landlord moved his mattress into the living room so he could keep tabs on when we left, came home, when we made food, when we did anything he would be there all the time, 24/7, so there was absolutely no privacy. He would say we could use things like pots and pans but then complained if we didn’t immediately clean it after we made food. He didn’t like the smell of people cooking so eventually he didn’t let us cook. He refused to fix the lock to the front door so it would take 5-10 minutes of jiggling the key until it finally unlocked. There was no lock on my door, that’s fine. Until I caught him on camera opening my door and checking out my living area, then complaining about a stain on the floor in my room. I was paranoid that he would go into my room every time I left the house. He then gave me 3 days notice to move out in the winter. I had no rights because you don’t get rights if you live with your landlord. He chalked it up to “dirty dishes” or something, but he kicked me out because he didn’t like me. That’s was it. This piece of garbage couldn’t give me an extra day to have my friend come and pick my stuff up because he “already called people to clean the floor and would have to reschedule”. So I had to leave some stuff there and he wouldn’t let me pick it up later.  I spent Christmas and New year in a homeless shelter. I’ve been homeless since December 20th 2022. If you see anything from 300 Bluevale listed then don’t rent from this garbage human."
2122,D & M LABBE,WINDSOR,"Posting because I've never had anything good to say about a landlord before: this couple who owns the property were kind, respectful, and quick to help with any repairs if we needed. They never raised the rent for the first few years we were there, and when they finally did they were super apologetic about it. We lived there for 4+ years without any major issues, and the only drama ever came from the other tenants, or the downtown junkies. 4/5 on health & safety - the property could use a little more security on the ground floor, as we routinely had people removing our screen to try to jimmy the window open on the front porch."
2123,SONNAM HOLDING CORP,TORONTO,"very professional, often present, responsive, pleasant. I have no complaints renting from Sunny."
2124,HARRISON LI,OTTAWA,"There were some illegal clauses he added to the Ontario standard lease, and he was kind of overbearing at first. But after we put our foot down on those clauses and established we knew our rights, we had a perfectly fine landlord/tenant relationship. Make sure you know your rights, establish that you won't be a problem tenant and care for the unit, and you shouldn't have any problems."
2125,TA PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,"Of the landlord’s I have dealt with in London, Tom was relatively good. He was understanding if a payment needed to be split or late once in a while and was fairly good at getting repairs done. The house was quite old so had a lot of issues but anything urgent was usually addressed as such."
2126,NICOLAS DE GAGNE,OTTAWA,"The application process was a little annoying with proof of work requirements, but after that everything was good. Nice unit, he kept up on repairs, and is quite responsive. There are times he may not be able to come deal with non-urgent things right away due to his work, but anything urgent he has someone, or himself, in right away to look at it."
2127,BUTTONWOOD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Solid property management - quick repairs, no ridiculous rent increases, fairly good communication."
2128,COGIR,NORTH YORK,"They keep raising the rent every year, they keep putting off repairs until weeks or months later. When they do get to repairs it so terrible it is as if they are trying to save money, while their upper management swim in their money vault while tennents drown in a poor excuse, yet overly priced, apartment.
They put million dollars in making the face of the building look brand spanking new, while the inside is rotting and decaying."
2129,SIFTON PROPERTY,LONDON,I've had mold growing and water damage all around a large window in our living room for over two years with multiple requests for repairs only to be jerked
2130,MIKE BUDDEN (2832381 ONTARIO INC),CHATHAM,"He seemed like a good landlord at first when he purchased the house from our original landlord. Over the course of 2 years he has neglected the house almost entirely apart from coming to fix issues that we bring up countless times. 

He always takes a long time responding to any issue brought forward, even in an emergency you may not hear back for 72 hours. Then he will take a long time to even come identify the issue, attempt to fix it himself, and then when all else fails, will get professional help. We have spent more than a quarter of the last year without a laundry machine which is listed in our lease. When attempting to discuss rent reimbursement regarding this, he attempted to claim that we never notified him of it."
2131,CITY VIEW RENTALS,OTTAWA,Ignored massive amount of mold growing and cut cement in tiny apartment causing massive amount of dust everywhere at 180 Murray in ottawa.
2132,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES ELGIN SQUARE APARTMENTS,OTTAWA,cheap rent for unstable water temperature in the shower. The supers are incredibly nice and chill and everyone seems polite. The only thing I could ask for is a cheaper apartment in the same building.
2133,PARAMOUNT PROPERTIES - PRINCE OF WALES COMPLEX,OTTAWA,"Incredibly professional and well kept building. Respectful office employees and great management from my interactions overall. Had major repairs done to my unit due to a pipe breaking, was there the next morning and done by the time I got home from work, cleaned up after themselves and made sure things were back in their original location."
2134,EQUITON LIVING ADANAC CROSSING,KITCHENER,"- Cockroaches have been seen in building.
- 1 of the 2 elevators have been unavailable consistently for nearly two years, despite having been replaced entirely 
- Building management is unable or unwilling to address noise complaints
- unclear how to make maintenance requests; there are paper forms that never get answered when submitted, and an online tenant portal that also doesn't seem effective. usually I just call or email the office now, which seems to work well enough. 
- Generally responsive to maintenance issues overall, including plumbing and drywall repair concerns. Less likely to fix smaller items.
- Frequent water shut off notifications that never actually result in the water being turned off, which is mostly just weird. 
- There were false alarms from smoke detectors occurring pretty regularly for a while but it looks like they upgraded the building's system, which is good
- VERY inconsistent staffing, which can get confusing. There's usually 2-4 couples working on site as support, office, or cleaning staff, but the turnover is incredibly high which leads to inconsistency in the way that you communicate with them and can negatively impact the cleanliness of the buildings/property. 
- Rent for my unit has not been increased in any way since I've been here, which is nice. 
- There's a small dog park and pet waste disposal stations on site, which is a plus. If only people would use them."
2135,PARK PROPERTY,LONDON,"Have lived in Cherryhill Village for 4 years. It was owned by Minto at the time, and is currently owned by Park Property. 
They've both proven to be responsive, helpful, and easy to live with. Repairs are timely, staff are friendly. Hope I never have to move."
2136,MEDALLION CORP,LONDON,"Location has gone through more employees than tenants in my time there. Parking was in the contract when signed but never delivered upon, meaning I was stuck parking at a local lot / abandoned building for 2 years (This was inquired about on a near weekly basis, nothing ever came from it.) 
The building is infested now with bedbugs and cockroaches. They will book a pest control company to come to units, but they leave within 5 minutes without resolving the issue. 
Not a safe location to live, multiple shooting/stabbings occured around the area during my time there. Homeless center across the road, which leads to multiple people in the parking lots at all hours begging. Car was broken into twice. The only plus side was that they did not raise the rent in the 2 years I was there or attempt anything illegal."
2137,TIMOTHY MARTYN,PETERBOROUGH,"Promised my unit to the convicted drug dealers living upstairs (before I moved in or met him) then stubbornly refused to even try to evict them when they began repeatedly assaulting me.  Never once did ANY maintenance (aside from an unreasonable & overbearing obsession about smoke alarms), but ""inspected"" endlessly (~30 times in 2&½ years, frequently appearing without proper notice even after being ordered by the LTB to stop). Never repaid me for anything that I paid for out of pocket despite promising to. Tried to force me into a new, worse lease before I'd even spent three weeks in the apartment by claiming that ""month-to-month"" meant that I had to sign a new lease EVERY month. Used the apartment for his own personal storage. Stopped paying the power bill that he was responsible for. Blamed me for the upstairs tenants destroying his house and literally filling the property with garbage. Told the police that I threw a rock OUT of my own kitchen window at the neighbours when the exact opposite had happened. Tried to insist that I owed him a rent deposit AFTER I moved in, and tried to evict me based on false & self-contradictory evidence. Lied himself blue in the face trying to convince the LTB that I had done ANYTHING wrong. Killed several of my pet animals and nearly my 5y.o. daughter & I as well by leaving an ozone generator running non-stop upstairs all weekend without telling us, and then whined to the LTB that I demanded he turn it off."
2138,"JOSEPH ABOUD, 1308 EMPORER AVE",OTTAWA,Dishonest bully. Tried to spring utility and rental feels on me that were not included in the lease and then threatening eviction on bad faith (never even tried because he knows what he's doing is illegal). I learned he had been scamming his other tenants like this for years.  Does not respect my demand to communicate only in writing (as required by law). Tried to bully me into signing a new lease with new utilities bills and fees included by lying about the law again.  Left a large (like 2 feet in diameter) hole in the wall caused by other repairs and refused to patch it up.
2139,SKYLINE LIVING,LONDON,"Terrible place to live

2143,JDN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,Pretty good but always having issues contacting the building manager
2144,SIFTON PROPERTIES,LONDON,They have a waiting list for a reason. I’ve been here 10 years and they are the best landlords. Any issues are addressed immediately. Very professional. And a lot of perks for long term tenants. I’m never moving.
2145,PHIL ROFFELSEN,STE SAULT MARIE,"Phil is disrespectful as they can be. The prototypical landlord that feels entitled and will bully tenants. Other tenants were afraid of speaking up against him. He also tries to keep your deposit and when you call him out, he tries to report you to prospective employers. He doesn’t even respect the tenant rights found in the tenancy agreement. He doesn’t respect your privacy at all. Always felt anxious living in his place."

2148,DUBRICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,Bare minimum with a shaky grasp of the RTA
2149,JOHN O'KEEFE,OTTAWA,"The worst landlord I've ever had. There were countless issues including black mold, rats, and a ceiling that leaked water for weeks before it being repaired. Every time there was an issue I had to fight to get it fixed and it was never immediate. He acts entitled and berated me on numerous occasions. He treated my wife even worse to the point that she had refused to deal with him anymore. Essentially John is a slumlord and from every experience I had with him after I agreed to rent from him he seems like a bad person. Stay far away from any of his properties, I've had many landlords and even the bad ones didn't come close to making my life as miserable as John or his ex wife (not sure if she's still involved but she was also awful in her own right)."
2150,BESTER INVESTMENTS,SARNIA,Honest and sweet landlord couple. Agreed to disagree at times but always respectful.

2153,WENDY C.,LONDON,"Keeps the unit in great shape but is very obsessed with the tenant's lifestyle and tries to restrict their behaviour (no inviting non-tenants over to hang out, no alcohol on the premises, etc)."
2154,TONY W.,LONDON,"Fixes everything on his own in the cheap ""landlord's special"" style instead of hiring qualified tradespeople, and blames tenants when his shabby DIYs fail."
2155,MOSTAFA ELGAZZAR,CORNWALL,"Refuses to make repairs to property, whether for an individual unit or shared spaces (laundry facilities that are shared among all tenants in the building.) Heat is building controlled, thus tenants must wait for the landlord to turn on the heat when it gets cold, however the landlord does not turn on the heat until it's been freezing cold outside for a few weeks. Building hallways also do not have any heating, so cold air continuously enters the apartments. Building is not secured, so anyone can freely enter the building at any time. Will yell at tenants and complain about their water bill (or other bills) when issues are brought up, despite this landlord owning multiple properties, with this one alone consisting of 20 units."
2156,TRICAR,LONDON,Never had any issues. Had all requested work completed. All legal requirements about notice are met
2157,BOARDWALK,LONDON,Really no major complaints. They repair anything that needs it quickly. They address any pest issue swiftly and there's no chronic infestation here. The worst we have are ants. I've never seen a cockroach or bedbug. The common areas are cleaned every week day. The laundry room is maintained and machines are fixed quickly when needed. Maintenance personnel are friendly and professional. Building is secure.
2158,SPM,LONDON,Worst property management company ever. Absolute scum.
2159,FREDERICK KNITTEL,KITCHENER,Great landlord all around. Very few issues if any at all. Laidback personality and personally cares about the building.
2160,BENTALL GREENOAK,HAMILTON,Very shady company.
2161,ANNIE LAFRANCE,GLOUCESTER,"This landlord owns a couple of properties around Gloucester, Ontario. At first, she was very friendly and responsive but when problems emerged, she would quickly become uncooperative and aggressive, blaming others rather than solving problems. There were issues with cleanliness, which involved bugs and mice. Yet, she did very little for pest control. The mice lived in the stove and she did nothing to replace it. We had to get the city involved for her to finally take action, which was minimal. Common areas in the property were also unkept and dirty. She did very little to enforce rules among other tenants who made the cleanliness situation worse."
2162,YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LONDON,Slum lords.
2163,JACKIE COVEY,KITCHENER,Jackie is respectful and honest. Her and Andre keep the building maintenance in order and are fast to help when an issue arises. We are grateful to live in a building that is so well kept and looked after.
2164,MAPLEWOODS (MORGUARD),MISSISSAUGA,Old building that is slowly becoming more and more run down. Office staff are a revolving door or people who can't seem to organize. Elevators are always slow with one being broken down most of the time. Water shutoff is very frequent as are the cockroaches. Above guideline rental increases are the norm due to aging infrastructure.
2165,CAMDEN PROPERTY,TORONTO,"Naina was the worse landlord ever. She would take weeks-months to fix anything that needed repairs. We went two months without a mailbox. She threatens to sue her tenants often and uses bullying and threats with any issues you might have. The rest of her team are really great people it’s unfortunate she is in charge. She’s hard to get a hold of and screens your calls, but when she wants to talk to you she will spam you."
2166,NATASHA / PETER (ORP INVESTMENTS),WATERLOO,"Pretty solid land lord, although once we got a dog they tried to unofficially evict."
2167,MICHAEL BLAKEY,TORONTO,Slum landlord! Where do I start. Lived on his property for 12 years. He never repaired anything or cared for his property. He never gave me a lease. Entered my unit illegally twice. Shared my contact Information with his Airbnb guest and violated my tenant rights. The smoke alarms in the house don’t work and the fire department made him fix the co2 detector because he didn’t want the fine. He evicted a single mother and child because he is racist and sexist. He only wants single men living on the property now. He showed up at my door trying to lock me out of rooms I’ve always had access to. The police were called and several reports filed on him. He will be taken to the LTB for harassment
2168,GEORGE M.,HAMILTON,"Lived in a house for 8.5 years on Rosedale in Hamilton. George was living in the US. He had a property manager that was a push over, I had to throw out thousands of dollars of collectibles because we had a room that leaked for 6 years. No kitchen light for 5 years, manager would bring a special bulb,it would work for a week and then stop. They put a bandaid on the problems. Landlord filed an N12 for personal use during the pandemic, I paid $965 plus hydro. We moved out and he listed the unit three months later for $2550."
2169,PETER LICALZI,TORONTO,"Peter Licalzi is not a trustworthy landlord. He lies right to his tenants' faces and changed the terms without compensation. He does complete required repairs swiftly, but only to protect his property from damages (such as a water leak). He brings in pest control when enough tenants complain about them, so there are pests. Overall he can't be trusted and he also enters tenants' units without proper notice. He also renovicts tenants so he can raise the rent about guideline increases. Best to avoid this person."
2170,TRICAR,LONDON,Overall pretty good. Keep in mind though that they won't turn the ac on until mid may and will turn it off in the fall while it's still pretty hot so twice a year our apartment is very hot.
2171,ERIC TROUGHT,KINGSTON,Pretty hands-off but will return a call. Won't bug you if you're paid up.
2172,JENINE WATSON,BARRIE,"The landlord refuses to clean common areas. Multiple tenants have informed her of the laundry room being dirty (bottles and lint everywhere, machines have old dirty liquid stuck on them) and she said she can't send someone to clean and adults should clean up after themselves. In the last 2 years she only cleaned it once because she was trying to rent out a unit. She created a 'recycling schedule' for tenants to bring the whole buildings recycling to the curb. If tenants don't do it, it will pile up for weeks outside the front doors. There is garbage all over the property that rarely gets cleaned.
Not only is the property filthy, she also harassed tenants to move. She has offered tenants money to move, and even after saying no she will send links to other rentals pressuring them to move out. 
When I had an active leak she wanted me to wait two days before sending someone to fix it. This was not a small leak either, and where is was positioned I couldn't even put buckets down to catch to water, so it was leaking all over the floor. As well as we had issues with the latch on our window breaking, she never fixed it after weeks of asking her to. Eventually we had to order the parts and fix it ourselves."
2173,CFHA,CANADA WIDE,A government handed off contract that can’t seem to figure out how to do many things correctly. Homes build in the 40s that barely look like they’ve seen much updating. Let in cold air in the winter and out in the summer. Basements floods all the time for everyone. Majority of “managers” don’t care. They don’t follow their own rules. Only real plus is they are cheaper then buying a house… barely. Wouldn’t recommend but better then sleeping in your car…… for now.
2174,MARK STAPLETON,WATERLOO,"He didn’t give us garbage cans with lids and proceeded to be mad that animals were tearing up our garbage, did not tell us he was bringing groups of people to view the house and was mad that is wasn’t in viewing condition. The house looks like the last time it was updated was 1972, and our fridge and oven were actually from the 80’s. He was always sending angry emails, and would give us less than 24 hours notice that he would be stopping by, and one time when there was a leak in my roommate room, he asked her if the water that appeared on her bed was from her roommates playing a prank on her. Our basement was flooding once and he wouldn’t pick up his phone."
2175,PANAGIOTIS TSIRIOTAKIS,TORONTO,"This man is an oily creep! He always has really really young looking sugar babies coming to the house and will be inappropriate with any young woman he finds attractive.

He let a tenant's place be destroyed by water and did almost nothing about it for a month. She had to move."
2176,AXON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"Horrible repair situation, expensive bedrooms $1,000 a month per bedroom in a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom unit, for what are cheaply maintained units. Tried to make us feel sorry for them because they ""were getting a handle on being landlords"". No utilities parking extra."
2177,DAVPART,TORONTO,"I have lived at 1944 Yonge for many years and have been more than satisfied with my experience as a tenant. It's a slightly older building but renting a unit under rent control makes the cost of rent unbeatable at Yonge & Davisville. The location and price are hard to beat. Sometimes when you need something repaired it may take a little while but it's not an unreasonable wait. Management tries to maintain the building but there are a few ""slob"" tenants that live in the building. I have also met some really nice neighbours in my building who I'll miss seeing day-to-day. Being an older building the units are much bigger than newer nearby rentals."
2178,TORONTO COMMUNITY HOUSING,TORONTO,"Mixed housing building managed by TCHC. I've dealt with bedbugs, roaches and several leaks over the years and they're pretty good at maintaining minimum standards but that's about it. It can take weeks to see action on issues and there is almost no chance of having repairs done that aren't legally required. Staff that I've dealt with are friendly enough and although I have problems with the state of repair, I'm not worried about renovictions and feel secure in my rental unit."
2179,DUBRICK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,"I live in a 3 story low-rise complex. Dubrick has been a good management company and are prompt with investing major issues such as plumbing. They're less responsive with non-emergency type requests (ie rotten cabinets and countertops). Our super intendant is really responsive to text messages and usually available to help if needed.
Biggest complaints here are:
1. No visitor parking - guests (and tenants with 2 vehicles) can park on the street and be ticketed if they want to.
2. Inaccessible for deliveries - shipping companies have no access to the building and there are no mailboxes outside; unless you're always home to let them in, you'll need to have a second address to receive deliveries."
2180,ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"They will attempt to charge many illegal fees. When you move in there are screening fees, key fees, and when you move out they add on a bunch of other nonsense like 'inspection fees'.  These are all completely ILLEGAL and you do not have to pay them.  Don't let them bully you and know your rights"
2181,SERGEY MELNICHOUK,GUELPH,"Constantly invaded privacy and made threats. Blatantly threatened to violate the terms of the lease. Made our guests his personal information. Unit did not include fire alarms, nor were windows up to code for most of the lease. He made repairs in a timely fashion but then threatened to stick us with the bill. Was not respectful in any capacity."
2182,ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,BURLINGTON,"Finally I can write a review for these guys without being terrified of their bully legal team. I tried to rent a unit back in 2020, they asked for three months rent to secure and I did. Signed all the paperwork, had a move in day and even booked movers, hydro, internet and all.

On the posting it had been indicated pet's were okay and there were no restrictions, so on my application I indicated I had a pet. Weeks after giving them my money and signing documents I get a call from the realtor asking me about my dog, which I found strange told them more about the size (small) and moved on. 

The next day they suddenly reach out telling me I need a co-signer, I who lives alone, single, no credit issues had no one to cosign for me they then told me I could give another two months rent to secure the unit. 

There was no way I was going to shell out 5 months rent - so they claimed I caused the deal to fall through and cancelled. During this time the LTB was closed and backlogged, so Royal York kept my close to 7k and withheld it only giving me a contract to release 2k of this money.

In desperation I did (I was now out of an apartment and had to live out of a family friend's whole in limbo looking for another opening for an apartment with another company). A year and a half down the line the LTB indicates in our meeting they were in the wrong, however because I signed the document I was out the money.

Terrible company, I would never trust these people again or suggest them to another tenant. Clearly shady practices."
2183,OMAR SCHULER,BELLEVILLE,"This guy is a real estate agent in the GTA. Rented from him for a very brief time during which he did nothing to remedy the black mould, cockroaches, no heat in 2 rooms, leaking pipes, all of it covered up/hidden until we moved in. Had to report to city property standards bylaw before he did anything. 

Seems like a laid-back nice guy, is anything but. Be careful."
2184,MIKE BARON,OTTAWA,"Mike and his brother Paul were the best landlords my partner and I have ever had. They kept the property in great condition, were responsive when issues came up, and even added non-essential upgrades like a smart thermostat and central air conditioning during our tenancy. They were very considerate and relaxed, letting us set up a garden out back and offering us first dibs when a better unit in the building came up for rent. They never came over without a heads up. Pet friendly."
2185,ACCOMMOD8U,WATERLOO,Terrible company. Counts on students not to know their rights to make money. Maintenance is late if ever and they enter without warning. Overcharge illegally for repairs in the unit. Do not recommend.
2186,DEB AND GORD HILLMAN,HAMILTON,"Terrible landlords 87 Owen run for your life. we’re at the property constantly, would be sat in the living room without notice, very rude, sent weird drunk messages in the middle of the night, favoured other tenants, evicted people without reason, definitely illegal housing"
2187,ALICIA NELMS,LONDON,"Responsive to requests
Professional
Maintenance guy responds quickly as well"
2188,LAURA HAWKINS,GUELPH,"Laura is very kind but if you’re looking for a long-term place to stay, this isn’t it. It’s a good place but every two years-ish, she tells the tenants she’s selling the house, and then goes to re-rent the rooms for 2-3x the amount they were before. This happened to the last two tenants. They (her and her husband) are good about fixing things and keeping the place safe but…yeah. Not for long term renting unfortunately."
2189,ROYAL YORK PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Royal york manages units for other owners. They seem to be consistent in my dealings with them. Note that for things like repair - the owners still have to approve them. They act as an intermediary. So repair will be hit or miss depending on the actual owners as far as I can tell.  

As always - keep track of all paperwork and payments. They seemed to have lost some EMT for my rent a couple of times so far. I was able to resolve it by forwarding them a copy of the confirmation email from my bank."
2190,Q RESIDENTIAL,ST. CATHARINES,"Our on site manager is amazing! It’s the head office and GM of Q Residential that don’t care about the tenants. We keep having our rent increase every year and still have a major mold problem in the bathroom, the appliances are old, the floors that were put in are made of cheap materials and are peeling/cracking. Now, Q Res has now installed parking meters for our visitors parking. Their reasoning is that tenants are parking there cause they don’t want to pay for a spot. If that were the case, then call a tow truck at the tenant’s expense. 
They’re a Toronto based company and it shows."
2191,FRED SHIELDS,BOWMANVILLE,"I briefly rented a house from this man and left as soon as my lease was up. He would show up and walk in to the house whenever he felt like it. You would have to beg the man to repair anything, major repairs were not even an option (foundation was crumbling from water damage in basement, mold, roof leaking, etc.). He would say sexual things to me on multiple occasions, even after I told him I was uncomfortable... also tried to put money down my top, ICK. Anyways, 0/10 do not rent from this creepy old man, especially if you are a female."
2192,SUBHASH MOJUMDAR,WATERLOO,Decent guy. Could be better at communication property conditions. Old one smelt like cigarettes.
2193,DMI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MISSISSAUGA,"The buildings on rathburn are poorly maintained with constant elevator issues. They have a roach infestation and no longer offer any amenities despite having a pool, sauna, squash court, gym."
2194,ACSO P.M. INC.,CAMBRIDGE,"Absolute Slumlords. I rented an apartment in Kitchener and quickly realized it was literally a crack house. I raised concerns with them almost weekly about people smoking crack right out my door, tenants smoking indoors which would come into my apartment, are random people being allowed to wander the apartment. My complaints were met with ""we're working on it"". It lasted MONTHS with nothing being done. After I had to call 911 because people stood outside my door threatening to kill each other, I attempted to break my lease. I was relentlessly harassed and threatened by Diane at ACSO. They tried to make my life a living hell until I moved out. Diane did an inspection on my last day and had the gall to thank me for being a ""wonderful tenant"" and assured me that they'd give me a reference in the future; I wish I wasn't as mature and told her to shove it. 

Never rent from these disgusting people."
2195,RICHMOND HEIGHTS APARTMENTS,OTTAWA,"The Landlord is good, but the management could use some improvement."
2196,BLAZE PROPERTIES INC,KITCHENER,"Living in one of Blaze Properties rentals has been quite nice. It's my first time renting since finishing school and moving out, and my property manager has been very good to deal with. When I had some appliances that needed repair, they dispatched a repair man very promptly. The only negative is the usual cheapness in the repairs. For example, just giving a leaking washing machine a bare minimum fix before replacing the unit. This is despite the maintenance employees confirmation that the unit had to be replaced after the first time he came out."
2197,MILAD (DANNY) ASSAD,VAUGHAN,"I rented from this individual from April to December of 2021. In June 2021, he came and said they were selling the house, and that I needed to move out and asked me when I would. I told him he needed to follow the LTB rules and I would comply. He refused. 

From that point on the harassment began. He threw temper tantrums when I wouldn’t just leave. He called the cops on my girlfriend and accused her of trespassing, yelled and screamed in my face and basically acted like a child when he didn’t get his way. He went as far as calling the cops one night claiming I assaulted his mother when she tried to talk to me about the drying running at 11pm. His mother and he lied to the police and told them that I pushed her and they wanted me arrested. Thankfully I had a camera in my unit that captured video and audio for the entire night and it showed that I hadn’t gone near them and there was no noise suggesting a struggle (mother claimed she screamed when I pushed her). I was never charged and ended up filing a lawsuit against them. DO NOT RENT from them. They are criminals and will abuse you and refuse to follow the rules or laws."
2198,SCHEMBRI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,The only thing about them is they don't illegally increase rent. Everything else is a nightmare
2199,ZULICH ENTERPRISES LIMITED,SUDBURY,"Zulich was horrible. My bedroom had water leaking through the ceiling and dripping onto my bed. The brown water stain on the ceiling was a metre in diameter. Another water leak occurred above my bathtub, and eventually resulted in a hole in the ceiling 7” in diameter. I also had significant buckling of the parquet flooring, about 10 sq ft.

I informed the building manager numerous, numerous times about this, I also filed formal maintenance requests, and called the head office (no one answered the phones). It took them over a year to respond. Their “fix” included paint over the damage and not fixing the actual leaks. The paint wasn’t the same shade as the original, so there was a giant extra white square on the ceiling. The leaks persisted and just caused water damage and brown staining over the paint jobs.

During COVID-19, they made laundry free, only to increase the cost of laundry immediately after masks were no longer required in the province.

One of my parents unexpectedly died, and I was late on one month’s rent as a result. I told the building manager about this and that I’ll pay the rent in about a week when I got paid (I just returned to work after my dad’s death) again, and a week later I got an eviction notice. I was going through the most difficult time of my life. I had a good paying job, but because I had to be home to take care of the aftermath of my father’s death, I wasn’t able to go to work, and thus, get paid.

A month before I was moving out, the building manager decided to tell me that I had access to an underground parking spot and locker despite them assigning me an exposed parking spot when I first moved in.

I lived in two different apartment buildings with Zulich, and the “updates” they did to these units was reminiscent of the early 2000s despite it being 2018-2020. “Landlord special” type work. They also love having your fridge door open away from your kitchen. Just absolute laziness of their contractors.

Zulich also had fun increasing rents by 33% between tenants during COVID-19. They’re crooks and a joke of a building manager. They own slums."
2200,AKELIUS,TORONTO,"Akelius bought my building after I lived there for years. We didn’t have cold water for 3 months because a valve was turned off. All repairs are done worse than what a 5 year old could do, if they’re done at all. If you complain about anything they say “why don’t you just move.” There’s garbage everywhere. They treat long term tenants like crap because they want us to move so they can Jack up the rent. They hire the cheapest contractors and the cheapest pest control. Textbook definition of SLUM LORD. The United Nations even put out a statement that they violate their tenants’ human rights."
2201,MEDALLION CORPORATION,TORONTO,"Been here 6 years.  Never had an issue getting repairs done, basic maintenance even pest control is timely.  Good about giving notices for entering, even my cats like them.  Monthly fire alarm testing, annual inspections, carpet cleaning in the corridors they stay on top of everything.  You're nice to them they are nice to you.  Parent online via direct deposit.  Gym is clean.  Laundry room is (mostly) clean they flush the systems and clean dryer vents once a month.  I love living here."
2202,ELIAS KOTSUO,ST CATHARINES,"Elias was one of the best landlords I had. Regret leaving the building. He was always willing to work with us, was friendly, and on top of anything that was needed for repairs or cleaning, despite not being from the area."
2203,AKELIUS,TORONTO,Absolutely disgusting behaviour by the workers. Once you sign the lease they become nasty.
2204,TRICIA CORRIGAN - ONTARIO LTD 2422126,SCARBOROUGH,"The utter definition of a slum lord. Just a little info: my boyfriend and I were renting the basement unit. I always paid the rent on time or early. 

1. Because of the shoddy work done by her husband, the basement ceiling is leaks water. The first time she seemed concerned. However as leaking kept happening, she starting dismissing the obvious water damage as condensation. 

2. Upon looking at the property, she said the items in the backyard would be cleared out. Upon moving in I soon discovered that her husband uses the backyard as a dumping ground for old AC parts, scrap metal etc. Whenever my boyfriend tried to clean up the place and put his junk to one side, he would just dump more stuff all over the place. 

3. They started construction upstairs and they cut through the ceiling and we had ceiling debris fall into our food while cooking dinner. They regular had saws and hammering going on after 7pm and on the weekends. When we reached out to the landlord, she said we were being immature and she didn’t have time for this. 

4. I subsequently called 311, because her husband and the workers they hired wouldn’t stop. At that point they began sending harassing messages to my boyfriend. 

5. When we gave notice to end the tenancy, she refused to respond to any realtors. She would answer and then say she would call back and never call back. As a result we lost out on a few homes.

After this experience I have zero sympathy for some of these landlords. My landlord before this one was a fantastic woman and I only moved because I transferred to a different work location. She spoiled me with her integrity and humanity, because Tricia lacks both of these qualities."
2205,"CARMELO ANTHONY PECORELLA, OTTAWA RENTAL LISTINGS",OTTAWA,"Where do I start ? This guy comes to the house everyday and swears on the phone/talks to himself so loud even the people upstairs listen to him. The swear are usually directed towards the tenants. He jacks up the rent prices every year with legal percentage but we pay him supplies fee of 15$. He uses this as an offset to increase the rent illegally. He recently increased this fee by 5$ i think. He comes to the house every Wednesday, leaving the tenants no privacy. We did write a waiver in the beginning to his arrivals. But he would come there even if there were no repairs. He made a master bedroom into half letting other tenants in, overcrowding the house. STAY AWAY unless you want to tolerate this for cheap rent."
2206,VALLEYWOODS (MORGUARD),MISSISSAUGA,"The company earns money from this to buy more land and make more buildings to rent in an endless cycle of 'you will never have a stable roof on your head'. Living here was okay, staff was good except that they will enter your house even if you're not at home or even told them not to and repairs will take months with no compensation to your rent. Sanitiser isn't filled everytime in the lobby and some times the room gets too cold because they will delay the heaters by giving absurd reasons."
2207,MF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"Overall - just a confusing, slow bunch of old people that took this job, because honestly they are not very good at anything else. 

Avoid if you’re a homeowner, avoid if you’re a tenant. Don’t avoid if you enjoy delayed repairs of your critical building infrastructure."
2208,AKELIUS,TORONTO,Akelius are crooks who provide barely livable conditions to their tenants
2209,REGENCY PARK,SUDBURY,"I have lived in a Regency Park managed apartment building for over 5 years. The landlady is respectful, kind, and responsive when asked for assistance, repairs, or general information about the rental agreement or building. I have even sublet this apartment with no problems. I have really enjoyed my time here and I have always felt safe and respected.
The only problems so far have been that they have tried to increase our rent, yet continue to fill out the paperwork wrong. Twice we have avoided a rent increase as something on the form provided was incorrect. Although this was a positive for us, it does bring into question Regency Park's professionalism and organisational skills..."
2210,3R PROPERTIES,TORONTO,"Lived in this apartment building for over 8 years - never had any issues. All repairs were made in a timely manner. No renovictions, illegal rent increases, or anything like that. 
Super can be a bit weird at times. My wife particularly dislikes him, but honestly, I don't really care."
2211,BOB BUNKER,WATERLOO,"Bob Bunker is a Brokerage Manager for Trillium West Brokerage in Guelph and a very negligent landlord.

He hides behind a false ""property management company"" who does his bidding. They do not provide their ""company"" name. Just a random woman who has access to a Gmail account which is the address of the property. 

Here is a long list of RTA violations that Bob Bunker committed. 

- Failed to provide his service address on the Ontario Standard Lease. 
- Interfered with reasonable enjoyment of the property having his ""property management company"" send over their ""maintenance person"" to take photos and spy. 
- Did not provide snow removal for the property. 
- Tried to include supplemental pages of void clauses contradictory to the RTA. 
- Failed to maintain appliances necessary for living, a refrigerator. 
- Failed to provide an inspection and/or abatement after a pipe burst on the property. 
- Illegally locked his tenants out of their unit on the coldest night of the year 2023.
- Coerced a tenant who he locked out of their unit to terminate their tenancy for compensation. 

The list can go on. Bob Bunker does not act alone. This property is an investment property with his other negligent landlord goons. 

Avoid a tenancy agreement with Bob Bunker and any business with Trillium West Realty at all costs."
2212,METCAP,ETOBICOKE,"They’ve renovated  but what’s the point when the apartment is filled with pests? In the past 3 years since they took over, we’ve dealt with cockroaches, bed bugs, and mic."
2213,BYRON LECKIE,TORONTO,"Follows the law to a t and the only landlord I've had who immediately gave me the interest on my deposit back when leaving.
Never tried to raise rent above the minimum guideline and the rent was very reasonable.
Kind of crotchety as a person but once he got to know you was pleasant and reasonable only if you were reasonable to begin with. Doesn't deal well with angry or argumentative tenants.
Was not great with repairs - did the bare minimum. If it was a major problem he would fix as soon as he was able but stuff falling apart he didn't care about.
Communication was fairly fast."
2214,HOMESTEAD LAND HOLDINGS LIMITED,CAMBRIDGE,"Writing review for Grandview Tower in Cambridge (180 Grand Ave South). Absolute mess from start to finish. Did not have a working fridge until the day before I moved in (this was noticed by me and the only reason it was resolved was because I drove into town from a different city a few days before my move to ensure it had actually been replaced - it had not). I did end up breaking my lease in order to move (I was there for less than 2 months total), I found someone to complete a lease takeover and paid the fee for them to ""relist"" the apartment even though I was the one who created the Kijiji post and found the new tenant.

In terms of Head Office (who I had to involve to get anything done), I dealt with Scott Pauls, who was the property manager (competent and professional, not too much to say about him) and also Katlyn Van Bommel (incredible, competent and helpful woman!). Onsite staff, Dan, was entirely useless. I'm not sure if I did something to personally offend him but he was a righteous pain in the ass for no reason and had far too much attitude for someone who was absolutely useless at actually doing his job and communicating the correct information. I think the only reason I was able to successfully reassign my lease was because I triple checked everything he was doing with head office. He told people the incorrect date for move in, said they weren't doing in person showings because of Covid (totally untrue) and generally seemed annoyed with me whenever he saw me. 

Sad about the management because the building itself is in a really pretty location in Cambridge."
2215,DAVID RODRIGUES,TORONTO,"Pros: He was responsive about repairs. 

Cons: He entered the unit illegally. He would not give any notice that he was coming and would not knock before entering the apartment.  He screamed at tenants. He threatened to steal our things. He only seems to rent to people who he thinks will not know rental laws and gets very angry if/when you are able to quote the RTA to show him that he is engaging in illegal activities. Unit did not have a working fire alarm."
2216,YORK PROPERTIES,LONDON,"Something is broken every week, currently hot water has been out for days, maintenance is not responding."
2217,OMINIRA ADEGBORUWA,ETOBICOKE,Joke of a landlord. No communication with her or her selected proxy when I raised numerous issues via text and email. Repairs that were to be completed prior to tenancy were never addressed and follow up calls were never answered (we could have declined tenancy but had to be out of our other unit). Tried to steal an additional month of rent from me AFTER we had signed agreement to end tenancy early due to lack of repairs and then tried to ghost me. Luckily my bank reversed the cheque after I showed various police reports. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
2218,MICHAEL MARTINS,TORONTO,Michael is the best landlord I've every had. Very trustworthy and fair.
2219,"FIONA GILLIGAN / AARONMORE HOLDINGS, INC",OTTAWA,"Lived in the building for 3+ years now. The third party company that the owner contracts out (Capital Commercial) to manage the building fails to get back to tenets in a timely manner, doesn't maintain the building, seems annoyed when tenets want issues addressed and have suggested but thankfully never followed through on sketchy ad-hoc additions to leases. If we were paying 2023 rents this building would be extremely overpriced. Building seems to have issues with pests although I haven't had any first hand experience with yet."
2220,WANSU YUN,RICHMOND HILL,This Korean landlord (wansu11@hotmail.com) is not respectful and won't return phone calls for any service request. They had a sushi business and was closed before (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/umi-sushi-mississauga). Avoid them at all cost.
2221,CAPREIT PROPERTIES,LONDON,"The most disrespectful landlords I’ve encountered. They’re horrible about timely repairs. I had a leak in my bathroom ceiling that took almost a year for them to look at, and then they cut a hole in the ceiling, and renovated the bathroom above me without actually solving the problem, leaving me with a hole above my toilet that dropped water on my every day, and made my bathroom freezing cold in the winter. This hole remained for 9 months before they finally patched it, and they still didn’t fix the leak so the ceiling was dripping water again within weeks. 
They turned off the hot water 1-2 times a week for the entire day without notice. There was a constant leak in the basement plumbing that turned the wall to mush and grew mold. It was there for over a year when I finally moved out and they still hadn’t fixed it. 
They’re great about making quick bandaid fixes but never actually solving the problem. 
They also raised rent above legal guidelines 3 years in a row. 
The property manager was a nightmare and was rude every time I spoke to him, talking to me like I was inconveniencing him by asking for basic repairs to my apartment. Several times he yelled at me for asking for updates on repairs I had already requested dozens of times. 
They’re also notorious for entering the apartment without notice. I didn’t know they did this until one day my boyfriend went to my apartment one day while I was still at work and they just walked in. He called and asked if they had given notice, I said no so he told them they should leave and come back after proper notice was given and their response was “you can try and stop us from entering but we have a key so good luck with that” and when he closed the door and locked it, they unlocked it and again let themselves in. 
Capreit are absolutely scum who care more about their shareholders than the tenants who pay the rent."
2222,SUMMIT RENTALS,LONDON,"Fairly good Landlord/PM Company. A bit ignorant re: co-leaser wanting to leave.. and trying to mislead Tenants. But otherwise reasonable good to deal with. Rents are obnoxiously high, but that’s an Ontario-wide issue."
2223,JERMAINE COUSINS,TORONTO,Terrorizing tenants for years. Many LTB cases against him and his harassment. Relentless pursuit of evicting tenants in affordable units. Overall a terrible human being.
2224,BRETT JENKINS,BARRIE,He’s the most disrespectful person I’ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with
2225,KEYSTONE PROPERTIES,KINGSTON,Overall a good landlord.
2226,MANOR PARK MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,"Not necessarily, a bad landlord, but they are evicting 250 families from their rent controlled homes, so that they can build new, more expensive units that aren’t rent controlled."
2227,HOMESTEAD,KINGSTON,"The building I lived in before I left had to higher security because of theft and people breaking in. Screaming all hours of the night, pests, maintenance entering your apartment multiple times a month to do absolutely nothing. Low privacy from neighbours and them not getting along so cops in the building all the time as well. Even with all my requests nothing ever was addressed. Was spoken to rudely by all members of the office when proving that they are the ones who broke my lease and I want to leave. Moved out in January and still respected my part by paying February and April. Tried to say I could not break my lease until I got my lawyer involved. Truly traumatizing never rent from Leroy Grant."
2228,EDWARD (EDDIE) ROSEMAN,TORONTO,"Cockroaches. Black Mold. Rats and Mice. We found a dead rat the day we moved in and spent over 400$ on cleaning supplies for a property we just got the keys to. The bathroom wall in the basement fell in one day due to water damage and we had a hole in the house foundation, in which light from outside shown through, covered with pieces of white sheets of paper for weeks without repair. Takes SIN and driver's license information - which is not legal. Harasses over email and in person - calls names and threatens. Shows up whenever he wants. Let's himself into property without notice. No heating for entire month of November. Hired un-licensed workers to do repairs. Leaks through ceiling (on the main floor of a two-story house) when it rains. Water leaking into electrical. Hired a vulnerable person to fix the roof, proceeded to not pay him after making him buy all materials for himself, which resulted in that person being homeless during the winter and later they had their foot amputated due to infection. Broke personal appliances after going into personal areas to shut them off to conserve energy costs. Randomly shows up knocking on windows to get in without notice."
2229,STARLIGHT,OAKVILLE,"If you like ants, constant construction and $2,500+ for a closet with no amenities this is the place for you. Had to get so much work done over and over and over because they’ll never actually address the main issue. Mold in the bathroom ceiling 4 times? Keep scraping and repainting instead of updating the vents (after adding in 30% more units to the building for money. But hey it’s okay, everything else was upgraded to handle that! Oh wait no). Just run"
2230,HYDE PARK IN LEASIDE,TORONTO,"Repair rating is 4 out of 5 based on personal experience as I still have repairs that have not been properly attended to a few years into my occupancy. For anything major, I'd expect that they would be fast to take care of problems.

Another fact to mention is that a lot of personal information was required in order to rent this property, including bank records, copies of pay slips, etc. It felt very invasive and I wasn't certain of their security and privacy practices towards protecting this information. I understand their position here, given the state of the rental market in Toronto, but it was over the top in my opinion.

The parking garage is filthy. They haven't cleaned it since I moved in years ago and it leaves a layer of dirt on vehicles in as little as a few days. While the property management company is good at managing their units, they have done a very poor job at managing their parking infrastructure.

Overall, this is a decent place to live. It's a quiet and safe neighbourhood and the management company does an appropriate job being respectful and attentive. It would take very little work on their behalf to get things to 5/5 across the board."
2231,LAVERNE SMITH,TORONTO,Laverne charged huge illegal fees on move out for damage we never did. She also repeatedly lied about what happened at the property. Avoid at all costs.
2232,ABRAHAM HOLDINGS INC.,TORONTO,Literally every year this landlord tries to charge extra rent.
2233,DIANA Y,THORNHILL,"Will constantly enter your unit while you are at work because she claims 'she thought she heard something'. Racist woman, won't rent to you if, in her words, 'I can't pronounce your name'. Seek housing elsewhere, this will be nothing but a headache."
2234,PROVIDENT MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"We rented a ""2 bedroom"" (really a 1 bedroom with a poorly converted den) at 2 Regal Rd. The apartments were cheap, but the building was poorly maintained, dirty, with frequent issues with common amenities and spaces. The management, when contacted about an issue regarding pest infestation (bedbugs), was incredibly hostile and combative, refusing to do more than have the maintenance staff (of which there was one or two for the entire building) come and spray an undisclosed chemical in the unit and arguing that because they had been in the rental game for decades, they knew their responsibilities under the LTA. Not so! And calls to Toronto Public Health confirmed that there were serious issues with the way these landlords were going about their approach to dealing with pest infestations. Altogether unpleasant, and hopefully folks are able to avoid renting from these slumlords."
2235,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,"It is astonishing that corrupt companies like KW Property Management are allowed to legally operate in Canada. This company is disgraceful, when I showed up to my rental unit for the first day the unit was an absolute pigsty. There was vomit on the floors the carpets were stained the walls were dirty, garbage was left behind in the front yard and the backyard, blinds were falling off the windows and held up with twist ties. These animals are now harassing me, trying to coerce me into doing the landlords maintenance responsibilities and are now trying to evict me so they can crank the rent up another $1500 a month. Don't rent from these criminals and certainly do not rely on them to manage one of your properties unless you're looking for a legal liability."
2236,PANADEW,KINGSTON,Still waiting years for repairs on mundane things. Refusal to maintain the property.
2237,JASON SIMMS (ABSOLUTE REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT),LONDON,"Sketchiest landlord I ever had. Rented from him in the downtown, obviously he was used to renting to students who don't know their rights as tenants. Had consistent issues with plumbing. Tried to trick us out of our lease and move us into a different rental house of his because he wanted to use it himself. Tried to intimidate us that we would be evicted despite being perfect tenants. Discovered some friends of mine were past tenants and he did sketchy stuff to them a number of years before. If you're a student do not rent from him unless you know someone that is familiar in tenancy law to protect you! Unfortunate as he has a number of rental properties in the downtown core."
2238,DOMENIC STALTARI (KINGSWAY MANOR HOMES),HAMILTON,The landlord has not been doing a great job of upkeeping their property. I've been a tenant at one of their buildings for a few years and they have started slacking on maintenance over the last year. They have been called and emailed by multiple tenants to make fixtures but keep making excuses about why they are unable to send someone out. Definitely would not recommend.
2239,JOHN KENNY,ST CATHARINES,A greedy selfish slumlord who renovicts every year to hike rent as much as possible.
2240,JOHN LUSH,PETERBOUGH,"This guy would stop by and let himself in just to do "" inspections"". He would email me at night seemingly drunk and try to start trouble. He would tell us how to lay out our furniture and micro manage our home. We keep a very clean home and there was no reason for anything other then him needing to feel like he's incharge. If tour thinking about renting from him be cautious."
2241,TORBILL HOLDINGS LLC,BELLEVILLE,"This building is a horrible slum owned by stuck up rich snobs. The entire place is disgusting. The matinence people are literally the most useless people I’ve ever seen, halls are filled with dog pee and poo from the last 25 years, they don’t clean the carpets or walls. The one window in the front has been broken since around 2004. Not to mention the frequent drug dealers and fights. The nasty people smoke cigs all through the halls and around the kids. Needles on the ground and vehicles being damaged and broken into with no working cameras. Not to mention the parents letting the kids run through the halls and damage peoples property and peeing in peoples laundry. Literally the worst building I’ve ever seen. Known junkies come and go constantly , and the landlord is a joke, constantly raising rent and not doing anything to fix this place up. This building is unsafe and I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact someone needs to take the owner of this slum to the landlord board because no one should be allowed to Charge people to live in a scum hole like this one. Do yourself a favour and do not move in this place. When moving in apts are not even cleaned or painted, hell the newest neighbour has no screens in the windows , no floor tiles and had no working stove for 6 months! 
Stay away, far away."
2242,COMPTEN MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,"Compten Management bought our properties - 2, 4, 6 The Donway East as well as 1053 Don Mills Rd in 2017 - They got them as a ""Buy and Hold"" investment - and began their tenure
They did awful, crappy, unnecessary and cosmetic upgrades to the buildings - which caused MAJOR problems, Human Rights Violations as well as inconveniences to the tenants.  They refused to provide ANY proper accommodations despite requests and the tenants going to the City of Toronto, our City Councillor, MPP, MP as well as the media.  They then Filed and were awarded a 3.2% AGI (Above Guideline Rental Increase) and afterwards they filed an Application to Demolish the properties into Condos with the City of Toronto.  WHY should tenants PAY for upgrades in a building that will be destroyed? Why would a Management Company even invest money into a building they were going to destroy in 5 years or less? Especially when these Improvements were NOT necessary, not required, were cosmestic or deferred maintenance ?   This is a financialized Landlord seeking to displace tenants and re-develop older buildings into Condo's.  
While they have done these so called ""Upgrades"" - Compten Management has cut back on basic maintenance issues - cleaning and garbage - which has resulted into on-going fly, cockroach, and other pest infestations. Tenants have made multiple complaints over the last 4 years to the City and we still have NOT gotten the situation fully resolved.  They refuse to deal with ANY Human Rights Accommodation Requests - even when tenants have had letters written from Legal Aid Offices or CERA/CCHR.  This Landlord simply will not comply with basic Residential Tenancies Act or City By Laws - They are owned by Jack Greenberg a Lawyer who uses his position to threaten, coerce and harass tenants with potential litigation if they do not comply with the Management Company's requests.
This Management Company manages and runs MULTIPLE properties across the City of Toronto and Missauaga - BE AWARE!  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!"
2243,ELLEKE ARKEMA AND NORMAN HEATH,SCARBOROUGH,"Elleke Arkema and Norman Heath continuously violated the tenancy act during our rental period, showing up unannounced on the property, often harassing or stonewalling our attempts at conversation, or demanding money for upkeep of the property outside of the rental agreement. Repairs were done by Norman Heath, who to date has no contracting, plumbing or electrical experience, but did not let that stop him. On one occasion, Norman heath cut a hole in the side of the house using a reciprocating saw, an was left unplugged for weeks. Elleke Arkema and Norman Heath consistently and frequently violated the privacy and comfort of their tenants, dropping by unannounced to the back yard, harassing and threatening their tenants from the driveway, and making racial remarks regarding their tenants ethnicity. Strongly recommend avoiding their properties at all cost."
2244,EAST WEST MGT,TORONTO,"Hello,

To anyone that sees this review...please do yourself a favour and avoid this property management company specifically at Top of the Valley Apartments located at 44 Valleywoods road in Toronto Ontario. I think this is the first review I have ever felt compelled to do ever in my life but I feel it is necessary as I wish I saw a warning like this when I was looking for apartments. All I can say is do not trust Estelle as she is not educated enough to hold the position she is currently in and if financially possible, look elsewhere for a place to live. I am not going to ramble as it make the review sound like I am holding a grudge and acting on emotion. Us tenants need to share information to help each other out and to call out Landlords when they are in the wrong and that is what I am trying to do with writing this.

Thank you."
2245,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,"Office staff regularly condescended to tenants, myself and others, treating them as uninformed children. Building old, but attended. Boiler died and took months to get back online, no attempt to provide space heaters, and didn't even bother to provide a timeline or update until group of tenants went to office and complained in person. Property manager called and lectured me about the fact there were moving boxes in my apartment when I was in the process of moving, and threatened to drag me in front of the landlord tenant board for asking about other units they had available as ""I hadn't informed them I was moving out"" despite not even yet having viewed any of the units, let alone decided to move."
2246,TONY & DEE,TORONTO,"Tony and Dee rent out several units in this area and are extremely negligent. Whatever your concerns are, prepare to have the ignored regardless of the degree of severity. Installed a camera on the front porch and would question us about friends visiting for the weekend etc. Property was falling apart and repairs were treated as a favour."
2247,CAMPUS LIVING CENTRES (17HUNDRED),OSHAWA,"Have had lots of trouble with them not doing anything about health-threatening and safety hazard issues (tenant above us was smoking and dropping butts onto the grass in front of our air intake - smoking isn't allowed in our building). They also regularly bribe for 5 star reviews, then deny doing such when people call them out on google."
2248,MINH SAU,NORTH YORK,"This landlord typically rents 3 rooms in a basement, with two washrooms. The individually rented rooms are locked but the entrance to the basement’s unlocked and open to anyone. If you rent any of these rooms from them, here’s what to expect…

Pros:
- Dedicated weekly garbage removal 
- Excellent response rates to environmental problems like plumbing, AC
- Maintains appliances at optimal condition
- Offers full kitchen, two bathrooms and an on-site washing machine and dryer (washing machine/ dryer accessible after 7PM or weekends)
- Speaks English / Vietnamese

Cons:
- Will make tenants responsible for other tenants living in the space (Example: Tenant leaves for vacation and fails to clean their food out of the fridge, will make the remaining tenants clean it)
- No pets allowed, will lead to eviction of animal
- Brings strangers down or enter the unlocked basement area with little to no warning
- No rent relief during Covid
- Dismisses tenant concerns in regards to other tenants
- Fire alarm always goes off whenever using oven

Overall Review:
Great if you’re a student and living there temporarily! But pray you have roommates who are mentally stable because that’s not the landlords problem."
2249,MENG CHEE LIM AND RITA SHEK,TORONTO,
2250,WESTWOOD HOLDINGS OR LIFE ON QUEEN (ALL 11 BUILDINGS!),TORONTO,"Stay away from any of the 10 or 11 buildings this guy owns.  This 'guy' is Davide Weiss, king of the Etobicoke NHL worthy backyard rink.  Let's buildings fall apart, can't keep staff (because he treats them so badly), doesn't vet staff (new superintendent was picked up by police after 6 weeks with 5 outstanding warrants...for serious crimes).  Doesn't hold property manager accountable for vetting tenants.  Two buildings are overrun with the 3 horseman of pests:  roaches, bedbugs AND mice.  Treatments are not performed to eradicate but to satisfy Toronto By-Law and yes, this landlord has a file with the city.  Must upgrade electrical, fire plans NOT up to property standards and yet Toronto's own RentSafeTO gave all the buildings a pass.  (That's a failure on the city's part).  Probably the only landlord with empty units because he wants top dollar but units are in such poor condition, they aren't worth it.  Currently, 1 super is a bully trying to evice paying tenants so he can re-rent higher and the other super is nosy, always looking over your head when you answer the door.  Landlord does not care for tenants, just wants their rent.  He will say or do anything to placate tenants.  The only thing he understands is a By-Law mandate from the city and fines for non-compliance.  And even that has a tough time getting through his head.  Avoid at all costs.  The only reason most of us are still here is because building is rent controlled and we have finally learned how to entertain ourselves by filing T2 and T6 to get landlord's attention.  "
2251,MONIKA MACIEJEWSKI,NORTH YORK,Horrible individual 
2252,JOHN O’KEEF ,OTTAWA,"Landlord doesn’t change the locks, clean, or paint for new tenants. When it comes to major repairs (toilet, refrigerator) and safety hazards (dead tree) he waits weeks or months to call a repair person or order a replacement piece. He is incapable of basic property maintenance, he does not want to lift a finger so renters have to  suffer. He talks down and insults renters to other renters, he told me his Renters are all stupid. "
2253,DHARMISTA ,THORNHILL,Most horrible manipulating landlord in the whole city. She withheld a security deposit and last months rent from every tenant that had lived there without a miss. She has also taken rent from potential tenants and on the day of moving won’t allow em to move in. Basically scamming them out of money. She usually targets new international students knowing they won’t take any action against her. 
2254,SKYLINE LIVING,KINGSTON,"After moving in to a unit it became how apparent both the previous tenant and the staff care about cleanliness: Dead bugs on window sills, lots and LOTS of hairs in the bathroom, mysterious gunk on some surfaces in the kitchen. 
Some maintenance issues from day 1 as well, which they took several weeks to respond to - all things they should have looked at during the moving out of the previous tenant IE cabinets coming off at the hinges. 
Besides the above I have had no issues major issues besides cigarette smell in the halls at any given time despite a no smoking indoors policy - living there has been smooth for the most part following the gut-wrenching cleaning I had to do on the first day of living there. There is the occasional night of loud music or partying; the few times this has been unfairly disruptive IE 1am on a Tuesday the landlord is quick to respond and ask the other person to quiet down which I do like. 
It’s not necessarily a problem but I would like to note on here that the building staff find some reason or another to enter your unit typically once every couple of months; they do this after providing written notice and it’s usually just to flush the toilet during the day. 
They are a good landlord overall, if you are anal about good hygiene and having things in good repair then I would avoid. Skyline staff if you are reading this - I mean no disrespect, I know some of you work hard to maintain the building and grounds, but people need to be warned in case they expect something cleaner/nicer given the high cost of rent. "
2255,ELLIOTT ST APARTMENTS,KINGSTON,"Never have I had a landlord make so many demands to enter everyone's apartments before. At least 4-5 times per year they are going through everyone's place which is incredibly intrusive and annoying. 

They are constantly raising the price of the laundry machines even though if you fill up the washer you're going to need to run the dryer AT LEAST twice. Awfully convenient to raise laundry prices while your dryer is barely warmer than room temp. 

They raise the rent literally every chance they can. Since moving out my current landlord has not raised rent one time despite my place being wayyyy below market rate already. 

The stove they provide is from the 70s or something. You know that gross yellow/beige coil element stove your grandma had? Yeah you still use that if you live with these guys. 

My apartment had no less than 5 different types of flooring. Basically made it look like I was living in a building made of glued together popsicle sticks. 

They added numbered parking spots which was nice at first but then people kept taking my spot as it just happened to be a desirable one and the LL did absolutely nothing, basically expected me to just suck it up. 
"
2256,MARCHIE ASUNCION,NORTH YORK,Nice at first but then became overly invasive and disrespectful. She felt as if I owe her something and wanted to control how I behave at the property. I left cause of that 
2257,NICK TAVERNESE ,NIAGARA ON THE LAKE ,"I just had to review my landlord. He’s honestly wonderful. In 10 years of renting we’ve never had a landlord this kind, this communicative and this fair. Can’t speak highly enough if this guy. He fixes things immediately, and respects our privacy. "
2258,JANE WOOD,TORONTO,"House is falling apart. Does patch up jobs instead of full repairs and the original issues ends up worse ie roof collapsing in winter, pipes so old clogging toilets water backing up every few months, steps broken never repaired in the 20 years she’s owned the house not one thing has been renovated. Shameless and disgusting. No respect for privacy enters units when tenants are not not there without consent."
2259,METCAP LIVING,ETOBICOKE,"25 Eva was recently acquired by Metcap, and since they have taken over the following has happened. We have bug infestations, have pictures of cockroaches in the hallway. Building management will call the police on you if you are loading your car of laundry if it’s not in a proper spot. Building manager was found to have been going into apartments without consent. Absolutely awful company to have taken over, the building is a dump now. "
2260,TOMSON JOSEPH,ORILLIA,Does not understand Ontario tenant laws.
2261,ADAM CANDON,KINGSTON,Horrible landlord. No communication. Mold in the house and moved in with all the smoke detectors off the walls. Says he will show up for repairs and then never does. Does not keep the parking lot in winter plowed or clear. Is rude when you contact him with questions. Do not rent from him if you can avoid it!!!
2262,SKYLINE LIVING,KINGSTON,"The biggest issue we've been having in the 2 years of living here is repairs. You have to constantly ask and things still don't get done. Holes and damages from water were left untouched for months before they even looked at it. Currently there's issues with the water mixers that are broken causing burns from water or freezes you depending on how the mixer feels that day. In the other aspects they are alright, no perfect but alright."
2263,KEVIN ROOT,PETERBOROUGH ,Despite multiple attempts this landlord would not complete repairs...he stood on my kitchen table to attempt to fix a ceiling fan three times until it fell on my head and caused a concussion. He would never give notice before arriving and would leave his stuff in our storage area or laying around our backyard. 
2264,SAGE,KINGSTON,"Generally responsive to complaints, though sometimes took months to fix issues. In fairness, said issues were generally not impeding use of the property. "

2266,ANNE MARIE CIRCELLI JENNINGS,KINGSTON,"Landlord is an older woman in her late 60's/early 70's. She screams at someone in her home, I'm not sure if it's her grandkids or her kids or a friend but she sound very angry. She's always acting like she's better than everyone else and in front of her friends or strangers she has this weird fake personality like she's trying to come off as perfect but as soon as people leave I hear her talking really bad things about them.  She is very disrespectful towards me, and acts like I should do everything she asks because I'm ""living in her house"". I can only imagine what she tells people when my back is turned."

2272,SHORELINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,"Terrible management company; terrible people; place is infested with bugs and pests, laundry machines have been broken for months, the maintenance people never give notice when they will arrive, and when they do arrive, they don't actually fix anything. Meth heads are constantly breaking into the building (or just living in the building, but Shoreline doesn't actually do any vetting of their tenants, so enjoy your crazy unhinged neighbours!) If the market wasn't so shit right now they  wouldn't have any people to pack into this building like sardines before they've even solved the massive infestation issues that continue even after treatments. Maybe its the fucking building eh? Maybe you need to actually do some repairs to the building?"
2273,SUE EMERSON,NEWCASTLE,"Moldy building, roof leafs, drafty. Ironic as drafty homes are supposed to keep mold at bay. Sue is mentally ill due to this the mold being everywhere. Paranoia, lack of privacy, nitpicking and manipulation are all common with her.

2274,EMPIRE HOLDINGS,OTTAWA,"List of issues since I started renting from Empire Holdings. 
1. Tried to tow my car despite being in my designated parking spot.
2. Fridge died and lost all my food. Was not provided compensation.
3. Radiator valve was rusted permanently. In the winter my apartment was so hot I had to leave all the windows open, even in -20 winter, just to regulate the temperature. It took 18 months of harassment to get them to fix it. 
4. Parking lot is never plowed or cleared properly. However 2023 I did see an improvement.
5. Attempts at rental hikes without an LTB hearing. 
6. Unreliable washing and drying units.
7. Roaches and ants despite maintaining an incredibly clean living space. 
8. Pipe burst some floors above me and rained down into my bathroom causing water damage. Building refused to acknowledge the problem. "

2285,BOARDWALK (KRYS) ,ST. ALBERT ,"Great place to rent. I feel my rent was actually valuable. The walls are a little thin, cracks form easily because of the buildings age, and the material they used to “Reno” the place was pretty cheap. The hallways are also not very nice but the cleaning staff do try to make it as clean as they can. Great place but just a few things to consider before renting. "

2293,DEEPESH AHUJA,MISSISSAUGA,"Deepesh was one of the most unprofessional and flakey landlords I've met. Four months into 12 month contract he told us that his brother was moving to Canada and will be moving into our rental. He gave us a month and told us that we had to move out. Being new to the country and still in the process of finding stable employment, we packed up and moved out. Thinking about it now, we should have stayed and fought back but we ended up finding an amazing place and ended up buying it a couple of years down the line. His wife and him were also quite nosey, only allowed laundry once a week during a 2 hour window. He also expected us to professionally clean the entire unit before moving out, randomly adding that into an existing contract. He plays this character of being an honest, ethical insurance/mortgage agent but I don't think is very successful.  "

Pros: very spacious, big windows, sunken living room with spacious balcony

Cons:

Holes in ceilings, holes in walls. Cockroaches and bedbugs + inadequate pest control. Water running down the elevator shaft walls at all times of day/night. Drug dealers loitering in the parking lot. Leaky pipes dripping through holes in ceilings. adjustable thermostats from a bygone era, broken, painted over and forgotten. Garbage all over the property. 

Clogged drainage at the bottom of the garage ramp so during heavy rains a mini flood would enter the garage every time the door opened. In winter, the door froze open on the coldest night of the year, causing the sprinkler pipes to burst and damage my car. 

Gang fight on property one day which ended in multiple stabbings. Yet they still didn't hire any form of security after that. 

dirty hallways, dirty elevators, other tenants treated it like a garbage dump. 

outdated and damaged. Previous tenants did 1000s of dollars in damage but corporation only gave management half of what they needed to fix it. She was crying when she showed me because she just had other tenants yelling at her about the shit corp refused to fix or upgrade. so we had to live in a partially damaged and shitty unit for the duration of the lease. "
2310,LANDLORD PROPERTY & RENTAL MANAGEMENT,VAUGHAN,
2311,MICHAEL TENENHOUSE,KINGSTON,"House is definitely old and in need of large repairs e.g. floors lifting, mold, leaks, broken appliances, and infestations. Problems are generally fixed within a week. Reasonable landlord managing a fairly subpar house."
2312,J. KIM,BRANTFORD,"The best landlord I ever had. The apartment itself was a little run down, but I wasn't paying much for it so it evened out. Mr. Kim was always super responsive, let me have the keys a week early for free, and gave all tenants a bottle of wine at Christmas. Genuinely sweet and kind man."
2313,MARTIN HICKEY,PETERBOROUGH,Excellent landlord. Takes care of his properties and responds promptly to tenent questions or issues. We are lucky to have him as a landlord. 
2314,KALA E. ,LONDON,"I rent a house in old east from this person. They have been responsive to any and all issues, no matter how minor. For example the hot water went and they had a plummer in the next day. The house has been exactly as described, well kept, and the landlord is available when needed. 
Honestly from other places I've rented, this has been the best experience I've had. "
2315,TILT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,ST ALBERT,
2316,R.PAUL MARTIN CONTRUCTION,KINGSTON ,A well maintained and clean building.
2317,RAKESH GUPTA REALTY LTD.,TORONTO,The Toronto landlord Raskesh Gupta is a negligent landlord with a long history of housing infractions.  One of his buildings burned down in 2022 due to lack of maintenance.
2318,ANDI REPPAS-RIND,KINGSTON ,"The worst landlord I’ve ever encountered in my life. She is incredibly nasty and rude to certain tenants and she also doesn’t fix anything, except for when everyone has to message her to fix something. She has never set foot here once and she also is a nepotism landlord as her mother is the one who just gave her the job, thus she is incredibly unqualified and horrible about repairing or getting people to repair important things in the house. I wish I had known about her before agreeing to the lease. "
2319,BARRIE MUNICIPAL NON-PROFIT HOUSING CORPORATION (BARRIE HOUSING),BARRIE,"Some things to watch out for:

1) They lie about the knowledge and presence of pests in their buildings, to both tenants and the media.

2) They often fail to thoroughly explain their policies and procedures, and many of them cannot be located unless you ask for them directly. There is very little transparency in their dealings with tenants.

3) Buildings are not maintained equally. Some are well looked after while others are slums.

4) Your lease might say you're in a non-smoking building, but what they fail to tell you up front is that the building is full of 'grandfathered' tenants who hotbox their units, stinking up the entire building.

Know your rights, and get everything in writing."
2320,DANIEL FARAH,KINGSTON,
2321,DMS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KINGSTON,Won’t fix water pumps in the building and pump fails after every  power outage. Smoking is allowed in some units which was not disclosed during showings or rental application process thus my washroom always smells like weed or cigar. Elevators are always a mess. 
2322,TILT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ,ST ALBERT,
2323,REGENCY GROUP LIMITED,EDMONTON,"Moved into unit and haven't been able to have mail delivered because mailbox is broken, been 4 months and nothing done.
Owner refuses to setup buzzer with our phones because people keep letting junkies in the building (they get in anyway)
Building Infested with roaches
Owner has called more than once harassing me about having my window cracked for fresh air exchange which is none of his buisness.

Complete Clown Show"
2324,DAPHNE DEAN,KINGSTON,
2325,AXON PROPERTY,KINGSTON,They are fine by most standards. Repair team is the best part. I wish they took more initiative to upgrade before things required repairs. 
2326,SHORELINE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ,KINGSTON,"When first looking into renting, I noted a history of cockroach and rat infestation from a post a few years prior. The leasing manager Holly assured me that there was no issues and the building is will maintained. Not only is there still a rat and cockroach infestation, but bedbugs as well. There is issues with other tenants keys not working, and having to use windows while entering and leaving their apartments. 

Trash is constantly found thrown and left in the hallways and trash cans, with zero accountability when trying to communicate with the PM. 

Would not recommend renting with Shoreline. "
2327,CHRIS SCHMIDT,EDMONTON,One of the best places I lived!  Chris and his dad were the best landlords any tenet could have asked for.  was a tough place to give up.  
2328,DAVID KAY,KINGSTON,
2329,KELSEY PARSONS,KINGSTON,
2330,ERIC TROUGHT,KINGSTON,
2331,NOMAD HOMES INC.,KINGSTON,"Rented from Nomad Homes, didn't really interact with the landlord at all, but the leasing staff was great to deal with, and they were quick to help address any maintenance concerns.  Beautiful house that we lived in for just over a year."
2332,LINDA PANNELL,KINCARDINE ,"Extremely nice lady, very understanding, very prompt and easy to get in touch with. She genuinely cares that the units are nice to live in. She’s not looking to screw people over, she is a nice person who wants nice tenants. She treated us very well!"
2333,HAZELVIEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,GUELPH,"Avoid all properties managed by this company, formerly known as Timbercreek Property Management. They are extremely disrespectful of tenants' rights and will make any excuse to raise rent prices. When they hire maintenance services or pest control, they will never do the job correctly, leaving their buildings a mess of poorly implemented 'repairs' and completely infested with cockroaches. The plumbing, heating and elevators break on an almost weekly basis and they will do only the most shoddy patch jobs to fix it. "
2334,SHAHINA KURIEN,PORT ELGIN,"Put the house up for sale shortly after signing a lease, which meant for a year, at the peak or COVID, we had strangers coming and going through the house. She tried to get us to move into a different property so the house would sell faster, but only at a higher rate. She acted like she was doing us a favour for following her legal obligations as a landlord. She cashed out key deposit cheque even though we returned the keys. "
2335,MARC HABIS,ETOBICOKE,"I have rented from Marc for 3 years now, overall he is a great landlord. He is understanding when situations arise (like during covid there was a month where I wasn't able to pay on time and he had no issues waiting until my next payday because I had communicated with him before the day I owed it that I would not be able to) 

He has never raised my rent my entire time living here, and he is usually quick to get back to me if I have any concerns or need repairs. He is a small time landlord, I believe only 1 or 2 rental houses and he is overall a stand up guy."
2336,DAN HORAN,OTTAWA,
2337,KW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ,CAMBRIDGE,
2338,KEVIN CARDOSO,TORONTO,
2339,CHESSJ,TORONTO ,"ChessJ has been my landlord for years. I've been looking to leave and buy my own place but he repeatedly peuesasded me to stay, convincing me the market will crash soon.

He raised my rents calling it a tuition fee and now all the prices for homes has gone up. 

He tricked me and now I'm priced out."
2340,RANI BEHARRY,TORONTO,"Owns multiple properties within the area, all varying degrees of liveable. Acts nice until you move in. Repairs are rarely completed by a professional unless you really fight for it, and she is impossible to convince to handle pest control, would always rather take the cheapest way out with no regard for tenants experience. Will threaten you if you push back for your basic legal tenant rights. 

Also takes advantage of young international students and at one point hosted 4 students in a tiny two bedroom basement apartment without firesafe windows.

She does not care for her tenants. Slumlord. 

Also is a doctor who isn't allowed to practice in Canada but does so anyways at her father's clinic under his name. Funny how tenants who apply have to jump through hoops when she is the landlord you apply to 

Avoid at all costs. "
2341,ORFUS REALTY,TORONTO,"Abhorrent conditions and pitiful management.

Mr. Orfus is a disgusting slumlord."
2342,BAOLING LIANG,TORONTO,Horrible communication. Refusal to make any repairs or address any of our concerns. They seem to be hoping that we will give up if they continue to ignore us.
2343,GUS SKARLATAKIS,YORK,"The split units at [address removed] are unsuitable for sharing. The landlords do not care about the tenants or encouraging a respectful and dignified separate living situation. They do not adhere to reasonable requests in a timely manner, or refuse to acknowledge the need for improvements. The units have zero sound barriers, and share utilities which is unfair and unsuitable for a peaceful living arrangement. Be wary of this house, the landlords who are just there to make a quick buck, and the property manager who in unequipped to handle your needs. "
2344,ELAINE PLATT,TORONTO,"Elaine Platt, and her family member Debra Platt are extremely unprofessional and unpleasant individuals. The lack of respect they have for the tenants and for their own building. No maintenance, just neglected and mean people. They will go out of their way to make you miserable and uncomfortable. Unfortunately there's landlords that shouldn't have that privilege or title. Awful experience renting from Elaine Platt at Overbrook Place, North York, ON Canada "
2345,JOSEPH FALLETTA,ST. CATHERINES,"Joseph and Annette Falleta are the worse landlords I've ever had in my life. 
The landlords coerced me to pay rent early and threatened to evict me if I didn't, and carried though with their threats with a fake n12. The rental complex has violent tenants that make noise and have overnight parties. The common area hallways in the building is saturated with cat urine, and cluttered with belongings from the tenant in unit 3. These landlords do not take complaints seriously about noise, violence. They do address maintenance issues and do remove bedbugs if need be. 
Joseph is a short tempered angry person that goes into rages. He even goes into rages at ltb hearings and has no regard for his tenants, the ltb staff or the RTA. My advice is to stay away from renting from them. "
2346,CHERYL BRANDON,TORONTO,"Cheryl is your quintessential ""slumlord"". She refused to make needed repairs, citing she was ""too busy"", and repeatedly threatened us with eviction and venous litigation. Even after Toronto bylaw had ordered her to make repairs, she refused. She even refused to replace broken smoke detectors until she was ordered to by city fire inspectors. "
2347,ALI CHAMS,LONDON,
2348,BARBARA JONAS (JONAS APPLIANCES),CAMBRIDGE,Landlord refuses to evict indoor smokers and uses a tenant who causes problems for others as her repairsman for the past 7+ years
2349,DAN DIVMOSKI,WINDSOR,"Landlord has let property fall apart. Fixes are all a Dollarama special if you manage to get anything fixed without filing a bylaw complaint. There are cockroaches and mice that they don't treat properly. Theres mold growing in the walls and laundryroom. Appliances don't work properly. Shower is leaking and was supposed to be replaced over 2 years ago. Theres no soundproofing you can hear the conversations of every other tenant. You unit will constantly smell of heavy cigarette smoke or meth from the neighbours. Landlord will not show up on time to conduct repairs or give proper notice. Landlord will cause problems between tenants by spreading lies about other tenants and blame them for his failure to be a good landlord. You'll want cameras in your home. Not a dime goes to matinence just in his pocket. Doesn't make crucial repairs for saftey, let the fire escape rot through and would not repair."
2350,LIYUAN (WINNIE) HOU,RICHMOND HILL,"Horrible landlord with extremely poor communication. She does not go by any laws and literally does whatever she feels like. She does not respond or provide any written notices, everything is through WeChat messages or voice clips. She ""does not believe in written agreements"" and this is where I fell into this scam because we did not sign an agreement so there was never clear details to the terms of the rent. When you inquire about the room, she will tell you there are no rules, that you can leave any time no strings attached, that she is very open and approachable and she will try to help you adapt to Canada. The longer you stay there, you will start to realize that she will impose more and more rules and restrictions leaving you no choice but to leave. When you try to leave, that's when she will tell you that the agreement is for one year and that you have to pay for her losses up to 1 year rent. This landlord rents our rooms to students new to Canada and she specifically targets these people to take advantage of them. I was a victim of this and I would absolutely recommend anyone to avoid this place if you had any other choice. If this is your only option, please please make sure you ask for an agreement detailing the terms of the rent, make sure she will provide you with a lock and key to your room and make sure you understand all the rules before giving her your money.

Some things that I have experienced during my time there....

She invades my privacy by entering my room when I'm at school during the day, she does not allow me to use the kitchen to cook (after cancelling the meal plan with her), she does not provide the proper heating or cooling to my room (I literally need to walk around with a blanket or have my jacket on in the winter time or have a fan blowing on blocks of ice in the summer). She did not provide proper lighting to the room and does not even allow the light fixtures to have all the light bulbs installed. When I informed her that I will be ending the tenancy next month, she immediately kicked me out without any proper notice, literally sent a WeChat message and excepted me to leave within 1 week. She did not return any deposit or let me use my deposit towards a last months rent. She constantly harassed me and emotionally abused me via WeChat voice messages until I moved my belongings.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
2351,SPICE CART LIVING (MANAGEMENT) ,TORONTO,"The building is falling a part, and property management deletes service tickets without replying. The 24-hour emergency contact information is just their office number and they never answer the phone. If you're prepared to live without heat, with mould and be ignored, then maybe live in one of their buildings. And the laundry machines break every week.  Otherwise, there are units that charge just as much in this city that are much more inhabitable than Spice Cart Management / Living "
2352,JONATHAN ZHAO,OTTAWA,Was completely mislead into renting this apartment. Not a true 1 bedroom as back wall is paper thin which allows even quietest noises from other 4 person bedroom unit to radiate into the apartment. Avoid at all costs. 
2353,JERMAINE COUSINS,ETOBICOKE,"Buys buildings, evicts the tenants by first making it so awful they leave, when that fails he evicts them for ""personal use"". "
2354,KATHY VUKOBRAT,ST. CATHERINES,Amazing lady. Once offered me a rent reduction while the backyard was unusable because of her dog needing the space but I’m already paying half the market rate of the unit. This review probably will never matter because I’m never going to move out but I just want to say something about the only decent landlord in Canada.
2355,FRED MONETA,TORONTO,"The house was very disgusting. There was a black fly infestation and mold in the bathroom. The landlord also showed up without notice all of the time and never gave notice. I decided to leave early because of these issues. I still payed out my two months noticed and was told that he would look for someone for those months. I was not allowed to advertise the place myself. He did not look and instead signed a new lease for after my two month notice, so I had to pay double rent. Overall while the house is in a really nice location not worth all the hassel. It is also extremely overpriced since all you get is a bedroom and a tiny kitchen and bathroom. Nothing is updated and while a cleaner does come in once a month everything is so old it's just permanently grungy and dirty."

2359,HARLEY SMALLWOOD,OTTAWA,I've been here six years and got extremely lucky how good it's been. We all know it's so incredibly bad out there so try to find a decent place and dig in for the coming storm.

2361,DOROTHY HOWLEY,TORONTO,"She's great! The unit was great so never had a reason to contact her. After signing the lease, move in was super smooth."
2362,ADAM HAMMOUD,WATERLOO,Adam was my first landlord in Waterloo as a student. He drove over promptly to address concerns and was an overall cool person to talk to.
