The property was in awful condition; dirty, smelly, broken light and fan above stove, doors off hinges, clogged drains, broken fridge light, stairs breaking and detaching from the wall, broken bathroom locks, the list goes on. None of this was considered important enough for them to fix prior our move in or after. They did not even bother cleaning the place before our move in, after we complained they sent cleaners that mopped the floors and NOTHING else. They charge an arm and a leg for rent as well, not worth it at all. On the bright side they don't show up without notice, since they rarely show up for any reason.",1,1,3,4,3

Then they did our balconies during the lockdown period of the pandemic and stretched the work out for the better part of two years. The noise was terrible. They have ignored requests for pest control or not done proper follow-up. They have tried to get tenants to pay for repairs on the property of the owners.

Sheldon and Garry had also violated my personal information by using my emergency contacts to harrass my mother everyday for a week. They have also harrassed the security of the building everyday to ask for information about me instead of getting in contact with me through my emails which he had to contact me along with my number. Building securities supervisor was also there when Garry Harrison broke in back in August of last year and nothing was done to address that breach of privacy and rights. Should have known rights would be violated from the beginning when Sheldon Rakowsky asked for 6 months rent up front on a Draft of a total of 11,900.00 and the next 6 months on post dated cheques. After the first year, rent was covered on post dated cheques and he didn't give me a new rental agreement for the next years and it got in the way of government documentation by making it difficult to get IDs renewed with the address and student information verified. Sheldon Rakowsky has also evicted me without warning or notice and there was nothing I could do about it, they only gave me 3 days to get my belongings and I was to get in touch with Garry Harrison to get access to my stuff within those 3 days. I tried to get in contact and was ignored, the next day Garry Harrison got back to me to tell me within the last 3 days my belongings were removed because I missed the window to get them.

They distroyed every other room of the apartment, threatened me. The cops did nothing, so did Ryan. In fact, the only job Ryan was good at completing was just collecting the money. The back door lock was broken and fixed by a bar over the door, the carpets were browned. Needles stashed everywhere. The unfinished basement smelt like piss. None of these issues were present until the previous other roommates left and he rented to two addicts.  I'm glad they had housing but they were awful roommates. I had been expressing the issues for months and nothing was done. Glad I got out before any physical harm was done. I would use extreme caution if he's your landlord.",1,1,1,1,1
18,GRACE PALLADINI,TRENTON,K8V2C3,"Grace and her husband own a few buildings in Trenton. They never repair, unless hounded. I had to ask for almost 5 years to get a new stove and when they gave in, it was like i had inconvenienced them to the max. They are terrible at lawn care and snow and ice removal. I have missed a few work days because we havent had snow removal. The husband is extremely vile and rude- hes screamed at me on many occasions, swore at me etc. He's also accused me of being untidy and leaving dog feces around. My dog passed away and it certainly wasnt me. My apartment is immaculate.

Bathtub was literally cutting my feet from paint chipping. They spray painted it. Great fix.

Kitchen floor was retiled, they took 2 full weeks to do (i had to be out) and didn't cover my furniture or anything. There was tile dust everywhere. I had to get rid of my couch as I was having allergic reactions and couldn't get it cleaned. 

They once accused me of paying rent late and sent me a snotty email regarding this. Luckily, I had all rent receipts (I pay my rent in advance). Once she figured out I was paid up 6 weeks early, no apology. 

During move in, the apartment was filthy, stove hadnt been cleaned in years, food i fridge and pantry, cigarette smoke stained walls etc. Took me 3 days to clean it. 

They have a washer and dryer- its $8 to use and never cleaned. Took me about 5 years to get a working set into the building.

They allow the neighbours to be extremely loud and do nothing about their chain smoking/ pot smoking/ extra people (im talking 2-4 car loads/ screaming.

He will often blame existing issues on you as a way to get out of doing the repair. He spends his existence squeezing every last penny out of his tenants.

A deplorable scum who with literately argue over every transaction and repair you could possible need. His entire operation model is “how can I make the most money for the least amount of work”. A man who cuts corners on repairs. He asks all his new tenants to meet at his penthouse condo to sign the paper work as if some weird and twisted display of power. When issues with cockroaches have been brought to his intention by multiple tenants in the building his response is always “you must have brought them in”. He will use scare tactics to try and pressure you into signing and then those same tactics to reassure you that the issues you are having are not real issues and not address them. 
He will give you building maintainence chores and then constantly berade you saying you are not doing them well enough. He will then try and reduce your discount saying you aren’t doing a good enough job while still keeping you on that task or just take away the chore completely.

All in all a deplorable human being. The size of the units may be nice but not worth an endless battle for basic human needs.",1,1,1,3,1
24,DAVID KAY,KINGSTON,K7K1E1,When things are going well he's great. One tenant cost the group building to get cockroaches it's like pulling his teeth out to try and get help with it. It's been 3 years and he hasn't fixed a tenant who puts out garbage all the time causing bugs and pests to be outside. Not to mention it blocking our doors. Check out the laundry without notice so we no longer have it on site did not get a rent decrease for this. Does not pay your interest on last month rent. Doesn't bug you about your pets subletting or ask for anything illegal like a deposit is good that way. Is responsive but is also a liar about how he's going to fix things.  It's kind of a mixed bag. He keeps the main building fire alarms in good repair. But he's definitely guilty of the landlord specials and just painting over issues. Downsized our fridge when our other one broke.,2,1,5,5,3

Policy for landscaping is ridiculous -- work done on the landscaping was so infrequent that weeds overrun the back yard. Promises were made about it getting professionally done that never went anywhere. A bathtub hose leak in the upstairs bathtub was never repaired (we were just told ""not to use"" the hose), and left water damage on the main floor ceiling that left one wondering if the ceiling might collapse. Tried to raise the rent above the LTA recommended maximum after a year, I pointed out that required a separate form and that a rent raise at all required written notice (the rent was never raised). We were N12 evicted, as far as I know the father still lives there. I don't think this was a case of being unhappy with our asserting our rights as tenants, I think we were interim tenants and the suite we were renting was always intended for family use. Nevertheless, I don't recommend a landlord who doesn't seem to have the time or desire to treat the role as a job.",2,3,1,4,3

Backed down when I pointed this out. Will raise the rent the allowable amount every year. Brings in a handyman to complete repairs in fairly good time, and has replaced appliances without too much complaint or question. Put the landscape care and snow removal on tenant-side -- again, this is not the tenant's responsibility in Ontario -- but I didn't make a big deal of that since I wanted to garden in the yard anyways.

Him and his agent (*********) will sell and rent the units he owns under a ""promotion"" of 9 months of rent with 3 months free when its truly a method to go around rent control and to ensure that he can raise the rent at a higher percentage than the legally allowed on a 12 month lease while also ensuring that your experience is so terrible that you end up wanting to leave so that you cannot maintain the rent you signed at the beginning. At most, he likes you to stay for 2 years.

He will over look, smells, infestation, noise complaints, privacy complaints and tell you you're bothering him and hang up on you anytime he doesn't like what you have to say.

The wife would literally become hoarse from screaming at him. She would stomp her feet and they would both throw things at each other. We ended up trying to get out of our lease because the fighting was multiple times a week, typically late at night, and would last for hours. We attempted to contact them and let them know their behaviour was inappropriate. One time, when we called multiple times in a row to get them to stop fighting late at night, the landlord stomped his feet on the floor above us in response to the call and yelled, '**** you!' at us.",2,3,3,1,1

Good: 
- it was simple to sign a lease with many friends
- place was kept clean, comfortable and safe minus exceptions under 'bad'
- regular cleaning service for shared rooms like bathrooms was nice
- they never cared that we all had our girlfriends basically also living there

Bad:
- landlord himself was never reachable once in 3 years. Always on vacation out of country
- management company would repeatedly put signs supporting their chosen political party on our lawn against our wishes
- extremely large mold issue in basement apartments that caused illness. Mold was wiped down by management but not removed properly so grew back immediately. Management said tough luck. One girl had to live somewhere else while still paying rent due to serious illness
- bat in the kitchen and managment said they looked but couldn't find it so that was that
- heat in apartment controlled entirely by other tenants
- management lost all the post-dated cheques we wrote them so I had to buy new cheques. Keep receipts for everything
- lost water for a few days due to city pipe exploding and had to fend for ourselves
- once got YELLED at by management dropping by because his wife was the cleaner and she couldn't clean the kitchen well because it was messy. I didn't leave it messy I just happened to be the one with class that morning. Also who cares just don't clean it if it wasn't left cleanable.

59,STARLIGHT INVESTMENTS,KITCHENER,N2P1Z4,"There were cockroaches, bedbugs, and other assorted pests that were never really dealt with. There was a point in time when a dog had defecated on the floor in front of the elevator and it was not cleaned up for 3 days. Landlords were unresponsive to any repair requests apart from the pest issue (and then, again, it was insufficient). When moving out (on Halloween), they said they would book the elevator off but then didn't until almost the end of the timeslot I had reserved (which was booked to align with the van rental, elevator booking at the new apartment I was moving into, etc). I ended up having to carry my belongings down 6 flights of stairs to the car until the superintendent showed up. She also left again before doing the walk-through I needed to get my deposit returned, so I had to call her. She complained she was away picking up her children and said I could just sign the paper (without her having done a walkthrough inspection or signing off that the unit was NOT damaged!). When I refused to sign a blank document for her to fill later, she said she would ""send someone."" A man did indeed come, take one look at the unit, and say ""I'm sure you didn't break anything"" before signing. I took photos of all the rooms and of the signed document, of which they provided no copies. The building was sold to Starlight while I lived there, and has since been sold again just 5 years later.

I would have lived here 3 years come August currently going to court for them trying to evict me after issuing a n7 notice for a ""safety concern"" after their landscaper ""trever"" was driving the plow dangerously in the parking lot so be careful after speaking up I was accused of threatening the said individual within not even 2 weeks I had an n7 notice saying they want my family out mind you I had a new born baby less then 8 weeks old at the time. My 4 year old and my wife were witnesses to this. Apparently because his ""supervisor"" heard this threat that I apparently uttered this was the evidence they had against me. I waited over a month to hear from Ryan (area coordinator) or someone of higher authority then the office staff as leasing agent is friends with any and everyone in the building and never took any claims serious. My wife was harrased for over a month from tenants above & nothing was done. As soon as this incident happened and there was an accusation about me thats when they jumped on it. Unfortunately not a safe environment to be around when their is gossip all throughout the building coming from the leasing agent thankfully we moved out for our safety of our family as it was not a good environment to raise our children around. The office has hardly been open in months ever since the nice indian man left were lucky if it's open twice a week seems like they make up their own hours and only work when they want. Tons of friends in the buidling are having issues with cockroaches everytime theyre gone they just come right back.

There is hot water interruptions every day it seem now at the same hours, early morning mid, mid afternoon and after midnight. I heard they are soon to be charging hydro. Only good is the buildings are fairly clean, safe and close to the subway. Another cons is Ryan/Wilstar having these terrible contractors. The building looks like a construction pit.  5 projects happening and none of them finishing. They did the garage 2 years ago and redoing it again. Why keep hiring terrible contractors? Also, what’s up with terrible pool and gym times. You sold the time to third party, who charges swimming lessons and
Yoga. I keep getting spammed with lessons. What else are you going sell to third party? Ryan, please hire proper contractors and have a project management on site. You are a disgrace and lucky to have this job. Roxor",1,1,1,1,1

They have no problem demanding rent but when we ASK for any sort of maintenance, we get ignored.
I really hate writing these kinds of reviews, but I honestly think they absolutely deserve it. Please start doing your jobs Wilstar Management. Please get rid of Ryan!!!! Also do something about the smoke, do something right. P.S hire real contractors if you want work done, stop hiring these terrible contractors that take on 5+ jobs but never finish them.

63,WILSTAR,TORONTO,M9A4X7,"Poor quality workmanship in the building considering how much they charge for rent. I heard Ryan wife is the owner of Wilstar, that explains how he got the job. I also heard Ryan has connections with the contractors, explains why they are so horrible and nothing gets done. Balcony restoration has taken far too long, 2 condominiums have been built in the same time across the street.

Garage repairs are a horrible fail, guess it can be considered a free car wash/shower depending where you park. Wilstar should be thankful they haven't been sued over rust damages to tenants cars because of the moisture/water issues. Highly recommend a car wash pass in the winter months or else your car will rust away.

Garage ramps are not heated and can become dangerous in heavy snow fall.

Elevator upgrades are somewhat a fail, service elevator is almost always off causing delays and electrical issues seem to be the norm every few months.

Units are hit and miss, windows are incredibly drafty leading to cold winters and warm summers. The new roof AC has a lot left to be desired, its energy efficient and weak so what's the point if every apartment has their HVAC running continuously to try and cool down. Portable AC is a must!

So much wasted potential due to poor decisions.

Laundry room has very early cut off hours so it gets busy. Laundry room machines will constantly break or not work as intended but still charge. Washing machines have flooded the laundry room a few times. It’s hard to say the rental prices are good compared to others advertised because the inconvenience and problems in the building make up for it. Thanks to this building I've learned to check company websites to see how often things like water are turned off for an entire day. Nightmare rental experience. Hopefully others have better luck or these issues get fixed/changed. Also there is a pigeon problem and residents have a constant fight with them taking over the balcony. You will constantly, constantly, have to clean up bird droppings on your balcony and be left with very few options to keep them away. Also we are not allowed to clean the balcony.

The fire alarm goes off 5 times a month it seems, and blares in your apartment for up to or more than an hour even when 3 fire trucks show up.

As for the replies you've made, you've told a few former tenants their statements are wrong yet so many have said the same things.

Faulty smoke alarms that would randomly go off for no reason, even when he finally replaced them after weeks, he didn't give us the right number of detectors so there were wires hanging out of the ceiling for months, gave up on asking for one more after a while.

Had a vegetable garden which was left untouched all summer, in August right when a lot of the plants were ready to be picked, a new landscaper he just hired ripped out all the herbs and vegetables with no warning. All while leaving garlic mustard plants untouched around the property.

Gutter above our main doorway was broken exactly above our main entrance so every rain we had to walk through what looked like water from a shower head, to get in or out, he never fixed it.

Asked to have the stairs by the main door fixed because we received a notice in the mail that they will no longer deliver our mail due to hazardous condition of the stairs to the mailbox.
He hired someone to fix the stairs. The stairs lifted off the cement in less than a week after the ""fix"" and he never properly fixed them

78,EDWARD ROSEMAN,TORONTO,M6G3G7,"The definition of a slumlord. The only person I've met in my life who I actually believe to be a *******. He sees it as his job to fight with his tenants. His default response is to reject, argue over and deny every single request no matter how innocent or reasonable. Nothing is easy. Nothing is straightforward. He employs a bizarre, inhuman, faux-legal tone in all his correspondence that is equal parts demeaning and passive-aggressive. He will pull incredibly shady tactics like listing at a certain price, then telling you that is the discounted price if you take on some of his duties (ie. shovelling snow, tending the garden), then harass you ceaselessly about not doing them to his satisfaction until you give up and accept the higher rent - which is what he wanted all along. This is just one example. He will pounce on any loophole and exploit any shred of naïveté in a new tenant to squeeze a little more out of them or be a little more derelict in his duties. 

He is a deeply unpleasant person utterly devoid of empathy. Again, I truly believe he is a ******* who sees his tenants only as income streams. Never in my time living in one of his buildings did I feel the slightest consideration for myself as a human being. I was an ideal tenant. I could go a year without contacting him, was never late on payment, kept the apartment clean and well-maintained. And I still walked away from it despising him and feeling genuine horror about the state of housing in this city. If people like Edward Roseman are able to be successful as landlords with these tactics and this attitude, something is deeply wrong. By all rights, his actions should result in penalties that make them untenable.

Repairs and inspections for apartment maintenance are regular, and things do get done when asked. Compared to my previous landlords, they are fantastic and certainly the best I've rented from in the KW area.

Some downsides? It still takes a long time to get things done. Some things are speedy, if they can just send their one property manager for your location, other things take weeks to book. Definitely remind them of things if you're waiting on parts/etc. as they will forget to check on things. Sometimes with contractors too they have some poor communication, and won't be told when something hasn't been fixed, so be on your toes to remind them when things are still not working.

Saddest part is that he gets away with it over and over. The Landlord Tenant Tribunal issues him a mere three thousand dollar fine. A slap in the face to the affected tenants.
 The Toronto Star’s reporter, Stephen Spencer Davis, has previously reported numerous times regarding David Weiss, the owner of multiple buildings on Queen Street East. Operating as “Life On Queen”

For the last nine years my wife has lived in one of his buildings. For that nine years she has been promised numerous times that the various repairs would be attended to.
Jennifer has resided at one of the Queen Street East buildings for 9 years now.

When she took possession she was promised that they would be installing kitchen cabinets as there were none existing. Additionally,  the management assured her that they would be repairing the bathroom floor as it is rotted out and the toilet is literally falling through the existing floor.

The supers are constantly calling the tenants “crazy” and/or “troublemakers”. 

There is a constant change of both maintenance and management staff. Often the management company will have tenants who are behind in their rent to do repairs in other tenants’ apartments.

Paint is constantly peeling off the walls because its not meant for a steamy/wet room, and no ventilation in the bathroom, so mold can quickly become a problem.

The building is also horribly infested with ants (common in toronto to be fair) and there is nothing we as the tenants can do to get rid of them, as they are in the walls and all over the entire building. They say they spray and treat monthly for ants and other pests, but I don't believe it. And as any place in this city, they over charge heavily.

Promised he'd come fix our cabinent and then proceeded to not fix it ever. Was relatively chill about us breaking a door literally the day before new tenants came to view the house.

Extremely hands off, only saw him maybe 3 times in the 4 years I lived there. Of those, they include the one time I caught him parked in the driveway and using our shed to store an oven he'd picked up on the side of the road and decided he wanted to install in our house (he didn't know anyone was living there despite me having picked up my keys a month before). The oven remained in the shed until we left, depsite a promise to ""be back Tuesday to bring it in"".

The second time I ever saw him was when he showed up unnanounced one night (didn't come inside) and demanded a girl who had left the lease pay him 4 months of rent. We reminded him she didn't live there anymore and it was a different girl sending rent money (always with our address in the memo) that he had happily been accepting for, you guessed it, 4 months, without question.

Didn't clean the house before we moved in. Did let us paint the walls however we wanted, and let us turn the fridge into a giant chalkboard.

Overall just a kind of okay landlord? He'll fix big stuff for you but any little projects, you have to do yourself. Never entered the house without 24 hours notice, the lawn service he paid for was awful, and snow clearing was tenant's responsibility. Didn't raise rent on us, except for the last year we lived there he informed us if we renewed, rent would be raised a grand total of $10/person for a better internet plan.

Most of the rooms are about the size of a one door garage, so the over $1000 rent is frankly outrageous.

Repairs are not done, period. There is mold in all of the bathrooms. The pool in the backyard has not been cleaned or uncovered in probably years, and there is a smashed and totaled car in the garage just sitting there. He appointed two house managers to take care of maintenance and nothing gets done. He stated on multiple occasions that he ""doesn't want to come over here"" to deal with issues and this is why nothing gets done.
Legally, a Mississauga house can have up to five tenants living in it. This house has at least nine at any given time. There were about eleven of us when I lived there. Neighbours complained and a fire marshal was sent to inspect the property. Jason instructed us to lie and lied to the fire marshal that there were five people living there and that anyone else was a ""guest."" I was there when the fire marshal came over, and I overheard him lying and saying that a tenant's room was empty and belonged to his brother. Clearly Jason is aware of the law and knows he is in violation of it and does not care about the safety of his tenants, he only cares about the money he receives.

He only buys refurbished appliances that are under a few hundred dollars (or did at the time), so things broke down. He would on occasion stop to speak to me on my way up to our unit (he and I shared the front hall) and this would usually lead to him trying to catch me in some lie he was convinced I was telling, or berate and scream at me. He asked me questions he knew I didn't know the answer to, and when I told him I didn't know, he would push me to answer anyway so that he could start a fight and call me a liar when I guessed wrong. He also accused me of being a witch who cursed his home because I hung red curtains up in our kitchen. I didn't feel safe living there.",2,2,1,3,1

Didn't run into issues until our ceiling collapsed in from a leak on the roof and created a 3ft hole above our living room. We told them about this in April and they said they couldn't do anything about it until July! This hole was still leaking and filled with mold- we had to call a Toronto Health inspector to look at it to get them to cover it up. 

They initially covered it with a tarp and then patched it without fixing the roof, so it started to drip again. At no point did they offer us a different apartment to live in while this was fixed.

My roommate and I moved out because this was not a liveable space anymore. They were actually showing the apartment to other people, despite this damage to the ceiling and the roof, and I doubt that they warned the prospective tenants about the ceiling or roof issue.

The house was a bit run down all things considered, but nothing awful (pretty standard for student housing in Sandy Hill, particularly in a ~100 year old building). Andrea also left her tenants little homemade Christmas cookie bags, which was very sweet and made us feel like she cared about our experience as tenants.

Supposedly the mysterious putrid smell was later traced back to a tenant who had unfortunately passed away in their unit and allegedly had passed long ago but despite repeated reports of the smell and concerns around its cause no investigation or check was ever communicated and in my time there the smell remained for months - I had left by this time.

The basics are attended to - there are cleaners who clean the lobby and hallways daily, including holidays and weekends. I've personally had good experience with quick response times to maintenance requests even including things like asking for our cupboards to be re-painted because we had chipped them. They seem to follow things to code running regular fire alarm testing, carpet and window cleaning, etc. However, quality has gone down over the years, in terms of things like amenities being taken away with no compensation in rent, the condition of the hallways (wallpaper, carpets, elevator paint, etc.) really going downhill and in need of repair, quality of flower plantings around the grounds going down. I have been to some other GWL properties and can see that here at High Park Village, they are not holding our building to the same standards as some of their other, higher priced buildings. They make excuses for not doing capital repairs like window replacements that they have been promising for years. And, as some others have mentioned, Dominic who is supposed to be our main point of contact for things is very very unresponsive and rude to tenants.

Mr. Khan put as little effort into managing his property as he did actually turning the property into rental units - when we moved in it was clear the unit has not been cleaned between tenants, even though he assured us it would be. I cannot even describe the amount of grease that was caked on the inside of the oven and on the range hood and cabinets (we had to clean multiple times before it was safe to use without being a fire hazard) and when we pulled the appliances out to clean the floor behind them there was a carpet of mouse poop like the stove had never been moved and cleaned behind. Further, within a couple weeks of moving in we notified him that the dishwasher (which was included as a feature in the listing and noted on the lease) was not working properly. He showed up within a day or so, but then proceeded to push every button on the dishwasher until it finally ran on the delicates/China setting and said “see, it works.” Needless to say we were not impressed by this response and never used the dishwasher (partially because it was as filthy as the rest of the kitchen and could only clean on the gentlest setting).

When he did request access to the unit for various reasons (for inspections required for his mortgage, etc.) he would always request access less than 24 hours in advance. We were accommodating the first few times, but finally mentioned that he must give us proper notice to enter. 

Finally, every year he would come to us with a story about how he needed to increase the rent beyond the rental increase guideline for one reason or another (sounds like you can’t afford to be a landlord then).

I'm not invalidating anyone else's experience with the landlords. The only comment I'll make is for the laundry room, as it's the only reason I'm in that building as a tenant of the same landlord. I agree that the shortened hours suck, and most of the time, multiple machines are out of service. I once had a washing machine malfunction while I was in the middle of washing my clothes. I've dealt with all three landlords/managers, and they were all decent. My direct landlord is the nicest of them all to me. Anytime my apartment needed something to be fixed, it was done in was done within two days. If I had a concern with any neighbours, it would be dealt with the next day.

Fighting over the hot water is what sucks about living in an old and low-rise building. If a tenant in my building uses hot water in another apartment, I must wait until they finish.
However, I brought up my concern about something else (by sending a text and a photo), and the landlord didn't reply, which was a slight letdown. The situation concerns ""safety"" but not smoke detectors, mold, or pests.

The apartment was COVERED in large holes from the previous tenants that had been ducktaped over instead of filled and there was no working shower head until *I* replaced it. There are two working washers and dryers for a building of over 20 people and most of the time, those machines breaks. We heard that another tenant’s personal property was stolen from the ‘secure’ laundry room that we had been advised was safe to store our bikes and other personal belongings and the landlords did nothing to help. On top of ALL of this, there’s a massive rat problem that they have tried to blame all the tenants for rather than admit there’s a hole in the foundation behind where they stack our garbage, allowing the rodents into the house. The only upside is the one maintenance man, Pino, who is always prompt and sweet when he comes to fix things. It’s a shame he isn’t the same maintenance man who takes out the garbage who photographs it if he deems it “inappropriate” and sends it to the landlords so we can all get an email scolding us as if we are children.

I have good neighbours, a lower housing charge than I could possibly get outside the co-op environment, and a unit that provides me and my family far more for our money than is available in rental buildings in the neighbourhood. Our volunteer board and committees work hard to ensure our co-op functions in the memberships best interest, and our office staff are efficient and diligent, often dealing with very difficult situations, attitudes and expectations. As a long term member, I'm impressed with how well our co-op runs, and how much positive change has occurred in the last few years. Many upgrades have been applied to our units and the buildings as a whole. We have low vacancy rates, repairs are dealt with quickly, and pest control is addressed far more proactively than in the past. Of course, it also depends on the members allowing this work to occur, and accepting that there will be inconvenience attached. 

No living arrangement is perfect, but our co-op is by far a better place to live than most rent-based buildings. We know our neighbours, share a belief in affordable housing and a mutual responsibility for our home and environment. Most of us in this co-op know how lucky we are to have this space downtown in a busy city - generally lower than 'market rent', member volunteers who are willing to give their personal time to co-op business, and an office staff that continues to function well regardless of pressures exerted by a few discontent member, many of whom struggle with life's challenges.

We had an agreement that we were gonna rent with her and already moved in, we didnt sign a lease at that point because we had a roommate agreement with a previous tenant that was moving out. We were working on finalizing a lease but kept sending illegal leases. We were trying to negotiate.

Then one day she sends us an email stating that we needed to vacate in Two Days otherwise she would get police involved.

We were incredibly confused and the reason why we needed to leave changed over 3 times, she came over and threw out our things in the common area into the rain, damaging them.

She also came without notice often. One time she did and shoved my roommate while yelling at him it was her house and he needed to leave. I wasnt home at this time but he recorded it and got it on other cams too, we put up cameras in the common area because we were fearful of her. She her clothes off and exposed herself to him too, the family member with her called the police and she tried to tell them that he assaulted her. After showing police the footage they escorted her off property.

Because we only had the roommate agreement with previous tenant and werent able to get a legal lease with her, we had no rights and she took advantage of this. For 3 months she promised we would continue to live there, then suddenly switched. We tried going to LTB about it but due to lack of lease we were told to vacate, despite her harassment and the previous agreement.

We had to leave without getting our last month deposit back.

I did lots of updates to the apartment and as soon as my spouse and I split he said he was moving in and gave me 2 months to leave. Then takes me to court and sends all my court documents to the address I no longer reside at so of course he won because it looked like I just didn’t show up.

If something breaks he will make the tenant pay for it even though it is his responsibility, and often the repairs are due to the shoddy workmanship done before the tenant commenced leasing. He will try to make the tenant do things like repair the mold, or he will deny that there's mold even though it is previous obvious.

It was a small apartment and it took me moving three more times and replacing countless beds, and furniture to actually be rid of the problem. I was dealing with bedbugs for years after leaving the infested property because they were resistant to treatments so I was forced to bag up everything and toss a lot of my stuff. She was not very personable and was not eager to continuously treat the apartment because of how rampant the bed bug issue was.

We had lived in this building for 2 years prior to Jeff, I moved in with my friend and then rented out anothwr apartment when I started dating my partner. We loved the location and the two bedroom was very spacious for us. When Jeff took over the property though he pushed out all the previous tenants, paid them out and RENOVICTICTED including myself. They refused to allow us back if we left since they needed to fix the mould problem. It wasn't safe to stay but we fought to stay cause we didn't want to go. We wanted to stay but he wouldn't allow it, he refused to work with us in a way that would let us stay, and we weren't gunna pay the doubled price he wanted for rent. At the time we were paying $990 for the apartment, now those same apartments are $1700. Eventually he paid us out of the apartments which are now obviously unaffordable. Jeff is very rude and disrespectful, he has no respect for tenants. I've encountered him other times since then as after we left, I'd still had a friend who lived in the building. I come over to visit him and help with chores and Jeff knew me from before and was very rude to me, and told me I had to leave the building and wasn't allowed back. He did this in front of his own kid too, he made me cry with how rude he was. Eventually my friend was also pushed out due to the landlord not addressing a cockroach problem and trying to raise the rent without making the needed repairs. My friend also had a fridge that was leaky. All around it's clear this person does not care for tenants and will kick you out of the building to raise the rent. Do not rent from this company or this person, and if they've newly acquired your building rest assured they will push you out. All they care about is lining their own pockets.",1,1,1,1,1

Property Management lady is rude and condescending. Treats the tenants like peasants. Treats us like we should bow down to her when she comes on the property like somehow we work for her, yet at the end of the day, she works for us, since you know, we pay rent and property management services are included in rent.

She will harass you and talk down to you and laugh and yell right infront of your small children and say that you’re a bad parent while doing so. Threatens to call loved ones and discuss your business you have with her as one of her many scare tactics. Asks you to request money from government assisted organizations so that she can “have a little extra cushion in the bank”. If she’s upset with you she’ll withhold vital services from you and yourchildren. Calls child services with false and extremely concerning accusations. The list goes on and on.

Immediately a ton of turn over in older tenants who had been living there for more than 6 + years. I found out when one the tenants was leaving they were offered a ton of money to leave. Then the never ending construction on empty units began. They left the back door to our building propped open, which was a fire code violation, but they didn't want to have to figure out how to ensure security for the whole building while the construction guys worked. This is an older building, that needed a lot of work, but they were only interested in cosmetic work to justify raising rents. The renovated units were fine, but with no real material changes to amenities, so no AC/or improved wiring for electricity. How to justify charging close to $2000 for a junior one bedroom is unbelievable. COVID hit and the provincial government put a work stoppage to construction work like rental unit reno's. The property management company did renovations anyways. Many of the workers never wore masks. And when you asked the building/landlords/property management they did not seem to care or understand what the issue was. Construction would happen till 8 PM at night in some of the units. To top it all off the turn over was high, so it was no surprise in our last year of living there, our unit got bed bugs. When scheduling to move day, I reserved the back alley for our moving truck on the appropriate day. The day of our moving arrived and construction workers were out in the back alley refusing to move.

Fast forward to yesterday (May 1st) when she asked if I wanted to renew my lease. This comes with a rent increase and she asked if I could start the new amount on JUNE 1ST. That's illegal. Had I not known my rights this monster would have happily increased my rent illegally.

267,TONY KROTIRIS & SAAVAS KROTIRIS,TORONTO,M4K2J8,"The landlords do not care about tenant health and safety, or to do the job the tenants are literally paying them to do - maintain the building.
A recent fire inspection found 4 fire violations, because it's been a few years since they had the equipment & alarm tested. They do not do regular checks on tenant smoke detectors, or hold regular fire drills. 
They have, on a couple occasions, instructed tenants to 'contact them before calling emergency services', which is ironic because the only contact info they ever provided is an office number (no after hours) and an email address which they frequently just ignore. They also try to make whoever called 911 pay the false alarm fees after calling emergency services when the building fire alarm is going off. I guess they just expect the tenants to send them an email and then wait outside all night with the alarm going off. 

Requests for maintenance are ignored. I have asked them numerous times to fix the building's front door, which I frequently find unlatched and open to the street. 

They don't even bother to give me the courtesy of a response when I send an email, and so far the M.O. is to just ignore the issue until the tenant gives up. 
They don't want to deal with tenants, but also won't hire a building manager/super...

268,AARON DUPUIS,TORONTO,M4J1A2,"The landlord runs a legal rooming house. However, there's many issues with the house that is ongoing. 
For one, repairs are done very cheaply and poorly to the point where it has to get redone after a short period of time or certain projects are solved with a ""band-aid"" solution. When the need arises to actually fix the issue permanently, it does not get repaired. 

Some issues I had where the carpet was dirty when I moved in and it was promised that it would've been clean but the opposite happened instead. The ceiling in my closet had water damage and it was only plastered, it occasionally chips and falls off by itself. My storm door screen is missing the glass and screen, the bedroom itself is an addition to the original home but it lacks proper insulation. 

A MAJOR issue: In the winter, it's extremely cold and very hot in the summer. He doesn't take into account that I would need a space heater which would cost more in the long run to keep the room at a warm temperature in which he then complains the hydro bill is too high when I try to keep my space at a reasonable temperature. The HVAC heating/AC does not efficiently pump the air into my bedroom either. 

Secondly, the property has had a mice problem for quite some time now. When I brought it up with the landlord, he insisted on using traps to catch them but never called pest control or used strategic measures such as not leaving the kitchen in a mess or leaving pet food on the bare floor to end the issue immediately. 

I'm aware that rooming houses are not RTA protected but the landlord insists on raising the rent by 8-12% every year; it's still cheap for Toronto but it's not worth the price where you have to deal with mice, an unclean home and the noise which consists of parties on weekdays by the landlord, renovations and loud music past 10pm.

We lived there almost ten years, when we got there they said theyre installing eves troughs, its now 12yrs after (moved out 2 yrs ago) still no eves. They order you to not garden at all. They come on the property outside and wander it because theres no fence. We had hundreds of things stolen and they did nothing fence wise. Multiple of my kids brand new bikes were stolen so we started keeping them inside they told us not to. Ken has a heart of gold, janet is coal. They told us they are gonna sell the house so i said screw that and moved out. House is not sold its still owned by them and still being rented by them. The house is shifting and falling apart. The walls are all separating at the corners, inside. Theres a basement but they refuse to let you use it. They claim fire hazard because of the furnace. Its not. If it was the wooden beams and wooden walls are also a fire hazard down there. Janet is all about controlling the tenants. Ken keeps things secret from janet to let you live normal, janet finds out hes a heavy hammer because shes in control.

272,SANDRO MOSCARELLI / MOSCARELLI REALTY,DUFFERIN COUNTY,L9W2P5,"Firstly, this landlord forced us into an illegal lease by requesting an ""animal damage deposit"" when he found out we had a dog.

It was an older farm house that we were told would be professionally cleaned and have new appliances when we took possession - was not the case

Roof leaked into the house in several areas, no proper fixes made. 

There was a makeshift sump pit that could not adequately house a float, so, a Christmas light timer was put on it. During rain events, it was the tenants duty to determine how quickly the pit filled and set the on/off timer accordingly. If not, the pump wouldn't turn on and the furnace would be under water. When the sump pump failed, it was our problem to replace it because he was busy, but, we ""better get on it quick because he was not replacing the furnace"". So we did. Took forever to get repaid for the new pump, and, he even went to the local hardware store to see if I had gotten the most expensive one on purpose ($200).

He literally admitted at one point that he chose us as tennants because he recognized I was a handy person and figured I could deal with the issues on my own (which I did). Shorting electrical outlets, failed gas fireplaces (which was the only source of heat for 50% of the house) broken entry steps, collapsed fences.

We took the rental because the rent was somewhat reasonable compared to anything in the area and we knew we could save for a down payment at that price. If the plan is long term rent from this partnership, I would take a good look at the condition of the property because you are on your own, if you bring up issues, he'll threaten to sell.

They will leave you alone for the most part (mostly because if he comes to inspect, he'd have a large repair list) so privacy is good, we were there 3 years and rent was never raised (mostly because of the ongoing issues) so there were some ""positives"".

273,RYNA,TORONTO,M6H4B6,Moved into the unit where the landlord (sheryl) knew the previous tenants had a mice problem and did nothing to resolve or alert the new tenants. The kitchen ended up being covered in mouse feces and we had to deal with them in the kitchen for the full 12 months we stayed. Contract was dishonest (claimed rent was split evenly 25% each but all of us paid different amounts). Took weeks to even take our complaints seriously. Air conditioning did not work when we moved in and kept dismissing us for nearly a month before sending someone to fix it. One of the bedrooms did not get heat in the winter. Backyard had been used as an illegal dumping ground when we moved in. Tenants were told it would be cleaned but after a month of no news took it upon ourselves to clean.

274,MCRS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HUNTSVILLR,P1H1C2,"this was absolutely the worst rental experience I have had in four decades. 

I had to involve the town bylaw office when I needed a necessary repair to my countertop; and also to ask the Town to get the property managers husband’s business to remove glass pieces from the parking lot after my bicycle tire got a slow leak. 

The property manager has zero knowledge of the Residential Tenancies Act. 3 of many examples: she tried to raise the rent in return for the countertop repair, she  insisted she could come to my door whenever she wished and she charged too much for the key deposit.

 I also had extremely dysfunction neighbours next-door neighbours who clearly wanted the entire top floor to themselves. the property manager ignored my evidence in favour of these neighbours. The husband was permitted to blow smoke onto me when I was outside on his deck, despite a clear anti-smoking regulation in our leases. he was permitted a propane barbecue, but I was not allowed an electric patio heater. this same neighbour also regularly informed the property manager that I was causing disturbances that did not exist. rather than investigating, as is her legal and professional responsibility, she always took his side at face value and kept serving me with unwarranted N5 Notices of Eviction. She even took sides against me when I showed her the efforts I had made to try to get along with my next door neighbours, telling me that I do not belong and should move out.  Eventually, I had no choice but to move when this property manager falsely and without evidence claimed that I was a danger to others. She wanted me out so badly that she was willing to lie to the police. Had she been more professional and dealt with all tenants equally, I would not have been in that position.

In general, she was good at handling the important things with a professionalism I would expect  from a landlord.  I would definitely want a landlord like her in the future.

283,LIVEWELL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,L8L2X5,"As a tenant of my residence since 2015, I obviously have a good standing as a renter. I originally rented from a private landlord who never raised the rent and was prompt on repairs. He sold the building to LWPM. We've been to court 3 times; a fourth in July.

As my unit is directly affected by the downstairs tenant such as heat, water and power I was never responsible for maintaining them. Why? The building is originally a used car lot. My apartment used to be the office. The fuse box, water line and furnace/hot water tank is all on the main floor, to which I don't have access so legally I am not responsible for paying these. If I were to be responsible, I would have access to the unit without notifying the tenant/landlord, thus these utilities were included in the rent.

When my landlord moved out, it was the responsibility of LWPM to maintain the bills. They didn't. They acquired the property in October 2018. March 2019 they were ordered to restore the power and heat.

2019 my house was home invaded. They refused to repair the door stating they were not responsible for the damage. Again, the court ruled the repair as the assailants were not known to me.

They cut the power again later that year; I was unable to cook or use the AC so I slept outside my front door and cooked off a borrowed camp stove. Again, they were ordered to restore the power and no longer interfere with my enjoyment of the unit.

It was not a legal unit, mold in closet due to poor outside drainage/ brick path needing levelling. Electrical panel was by the sink, furnace was inside a ""bedroom"" and not enclosed, carpeting was filthy on move in day, emergencyexit door to above unit nailed shut.

She failed at every attempt to fix things that went wrong with the house.  We had no warm water for months.  She treated us like servants rather than law-abiding tenants.  We loved living in her house and were friends with ALL neighbours, until she successfully made us leave.

Upon leaving she withheld the deposit for wear and tear. We had lived there 2.5yrs, first inhabitants of the space and the ebony hardwood had some scuff from wear as well as sun damage from the floor to ceiling wall to wall window. Inna did not provide curtains. The walls were painted that builder grade matte thin paint and had a bit of wear since you can't wash them and some small holes from art and 1 shelf. Perfectly normal wear and tear. We were not allowed to paint other than white so opted not to spend our money on a space we knew wasn't our forever. 
We had to deliver the keys to her in Markham instead of her coming to the property (that had security/doormen we could have left it with). 
We did damage a mirrored door on move out and told her to keep the deposit as a result. But she wanted to charge extra for wear and tear. She never did an inspection or entered the property the entire time we lived there. We dealt with the building management for repairs and she never made that more difficult than it needed to be.

He asked me to vacate if I was not willing to pay the illegal amount. Once there was a bed bug issue in the place (which landlords are supposed to take care of). He made me pay for it.  

He also did not return the key deposit ($600) when I moved out even though I returned the keys and left the place in good shape. He just stopped picking up my calls or answering texts when I called him about the deposit. So, I had to register a complaint against him with the Rental Enforcement Unit (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing). They sent him several notices which he did not respond to. Finally, they sent him a notice that said he has to appear in court if he doesn't return the deposit. That was when he returned the deposit. 

It was generally stressful to deal with him. He would not give proper notice before visiting the place (landlords are supposed to give 24 hours notice). I am glad I moved out of his place.",3,1,1,2,1

A lot of tenants have waited years for emergent repairs within units to be ignored and given excuses. Bed bug and ant problems have been out of control for years because its always a quick fix. Several tenants have been without basic needs for several years because the necessary repairs have not been done. There is never room in the dumpsters for garbage because people come off the street to dump their garbage for free and nothing is ever done about it. Elevators are constantly broken and out of service weekly. Elevators always have dog urine in them and is never cleaned. The ""secure"" door in the lobby is always open for anyone to come in, or broken. One of the tenants that did repairs in the building gossips to the rest of the building what the inside of their apartment is like which is not only disrespectful but a violation of privacy. Overall the health and safety standards of this building are absolutely subpar. If the health unit ever came into this building and did a full inspection I have no doubt this building would be condemned because the management and the landlord refuse to properly take care of the building or do necessary repairs. They just want to make money and put as little into the building as possible. Renting from this building means a run down overpriced apartment with kitchen counters that are painted over, appliances from the 1980's/90's that constantly break, have neighbors who are convicted felons and constantly steal from everyone in the building regardless of the security cameras because nothing is ever done, and having to pay for all your repairs and renovations out of pocket because the landlord will never come do them.

Flooring is in poor shape and won’t be replaced during rental period. Exterior repairs like missing shingles and siding damaged in storms is almost never done. 

Recently, Nathan himself stopped by under the pretence of a smoke detector inspection. He used the visit to threaten selling the property… unless of course we could agree to raise the rent by several hundred a month. Hard to imagine a holding company with hundreds of units is so hard for cash that they’d need to sell one particular unit unless they could get a few hundred more in rent. Felt more like a phishing expedition with no paper trail. We’ll let the LTB decide.

My biggest complaint is that they eliminated the on-site manager position a couple of years ago, so now all work requests have to be called in. This is definitely less convenient. Also, their upkeep of shared outdoor spaces in the townhouse complex is a bit lacking - basically, they just mow the lawn and don't bother with anything else as far as planting gardens, reseeding bare spots, etc. But, they don't bother tenants who put in the effort to spruce up their front or back yards, or pester them to remove items from their patios.

It appears to be a case of letting the building rot until he decides to sell to a developer one day. The unit is not properly insulated (freezing in the winter, stifling in the summer). The main windows do not open (one window that opened in the entire unit) so the renter must keep the balcony door open for any airflow.

The only heating/cooling came from a lone wall unit. The unit was not powerful enough to reach the bedroom. The hydro bill was so astronomical living there that running the heater or air conditioning enough to properly cool or heat the apartment would bankrupt a renter (on average $*****/month in the winter, without running it consistently).
 
The apartment had a pest problem which Orest chose to ignore. There were loud sounds of animals in the ceiling (scratching, movement, burrowing). When he was informed of the issue, he said the animals would ""find their way out eventually."" Then there was a mouse problem. Again he refused to send any sort of exterminators and said it was too costly. I ended up taking on the issue myself, sealing up holes in the walls that were the result of shoddy installation (huge holes/gaps behind all appliances—guess where the mice came in from). 

Finally, when leaving the apartment, it was revealed the dryer had been installed incorrectly and was a massive fire hazard. The maintenance person fixed the hazard but it was startling to find out the reason the dryer didn't work very well was also what could have led to a possible fire.

One of his basement suites is illegal (they don't have their own address, they don't pay for their own utilities, they don't have a fire exit, and the ceilings are less than 6ft tall throughout). The basement unit had mold growing on their ceiling due to a leak, but instead of addressing it, he painted over it and then blamed the tenants who moved in next for the mold when in penetrated the paint. Many issues we flagged the week we moved in have not been addressed (broken laundry dryer vent, hole in the wall, leaking kitchen sink, huge ice blocks that continually build up in the freezer, none of our inside doors fully close).

Several parts of the house needed repair, and Derek would hesitate to believe me when we would describe the issue and even when identified, would take several days or weeks to repair. 

It's stated in the lease that tenants have no ownership of garages and sheds, which is agreeable. But because these units are used for the landlord's personal storage, I found on several occasions, my driveway would be occupied for the purpose of large equipment being loaded. Though nobody was entering the property, it would at times block tenants from entering or exiting the driveway, which was a disruption for students with back-to-back schedules, relying on the use of a safe driveway,",1,1,1,2,3

We were renting a small townhouse unit in Toronto from Izhar & Shelha (less than***** ft) for roughly*****  Here's a list of some faults by category:
- Rent Increases: Asked continuously to increase rent above the federal guidelines without valid reasons as outlined by the Residential Tenancies Act. Challenged the effective rent increase dates as they never gave notice of rent increases on time.
- Deposits: Requested key deposit of $***** which is higher than the legal amount they should have requested.  Locks were never replaced before we moved into the unit and they refused to change the locks/keys at our request.  Asked for an additional deposit of month's rent (in addition to first & last). Kept the key deposit after keys were returned.
- Repairs:  They blamed us for damage that existed prior to us moving into the unit and challenged us on this until we found an old listing that was still active with photos of the damage.  Would not fix issues reported to them (eg. roof needed repair for***** - wanted us to repair dmg). Stated we did not need a new washer/dryer when washer broke (part of our lease).  Asked us to repair small things including leaking plumbing and missing vent caps. Refused to pay us back for hired plumbers even after stating they'll pay.
- Privacy:  Attempted to enter unit 2x without notice while we were sleeping.  Hired roofer without informing us work was being done and they saw my gf showering from the upstairs washroom window.
- Eviction:  claimed they wanted to move their daughter in but listed at 40% higher rent a week later. 
- Integrity: new listing after we moved stated 2,***** sq ft (it's***** reality).  Staged to look lived in after vacant home tax went in effect.

Entry notifications for repairs etc were not followed (eg. get a notification they'll come on one day, but they actually come a day early). When I lived there, they advertised the rent at a certain amount but that's actually after a ""pay on time discount"" - so, effectively, you are charged if you pay late. If you are late you need a money order ($25) or you have to go to their office and pay in person (office isn't in the building, it's downtown, and only open during the day).

The units themselves are nice, and they do paint them when tenants change and make sure they are clean - no complaints here.  I haven't had any problems with management - they are all very pleasant to deal with and have never been rude or abrupt with me.  My issue is with the general cleanliness of the three buildings - there is no proactive approach.  For example, the garbage chutes are always dirty and it's gross (the exterior door you pull open and the interior flap). Not sure why they can't include wiping them as part of the weekly cycle when they are vacuuming the place.  Also, no one can explain to me why they shut down the recyle/organics after 5pm and on weekends so all garbage goes directly to actual garbage outside of 8-5.  There is ridiculous in this day and age and should not be happening. Dog pee stains on the carpet are never properly cleaned.  When mentioned, they say ""It's been cleaned"" which I know they did, but perhaps use something different that works? It looks revolting walking through the lobby with dog pee stains all over the place.  There isn't a regular **** patrol of their grounds so it's most often disgusting as alot of people don't clean up after their pets and I don't get the sense they think they should do it even though it's their property. Either figure out who is doing that and deal with it, or clean it up regularly.  The rooftop patio is closed again ""until further notice"". This is one of the reasons I moved here and they give no idea when it will be reopened. The gym is way, way too small for the number of tenants they have so it's impossible to use at times.

This is how much they disrespect people. 
I had an elderly neighbour who asked to switch units because of bright sunlight. They agreed, and though she'd been long term and her utilities were included, they said nothing, and then sent her utilities to private companies. Her first hydro bill was in the hundreds of dollars.

If you're in one of the LivMore buildings, take note: these are recent builds, and they are not subject to rent control. If you're flush with cash this isn't a problem, but who really wants to pay up to *****$ for an apartment, especially if the service is poor, and if the rent will increase above the provincial average annually??

When they finally showed up, they covered it with paint to HIDE it. Rent was increased by seven hundred for two years, despite their promises they'd follow rent increase guidelines in Ontario. They blamed me for the unit not being rented out, though they posted a higher price, neglected and ignored to fix the unit. They never returned the key deposit, claiming they need to pay for cleaning and painting.

I left the property fairly clean(even steamed the floor). I just wanted to be respectful until the end of the tenancy. All the ""dirtiness"" they pointed out was some dust in the drawers and fridge and some scratches on the outside of the entry door(which the building management properly inspected that I didn't do any damage when I moved in and out), and stains on the wall caused by sunlight or furniture due to natural use. The building has issues raised by other units, but they blamed me for taking $***** key deposit. They were confrontational and spoke in Korean conveniently when I tried to argue. This was completely unfair and unreasonable, but I didn't want to spend any more minutes with the hopeless people, so I let them keep the deposit.

Overall, I strongly advise against renting from them, but if you unfortunately already moved in, make sure ALL damages on the ceilings (there are so many cracks adjacent to walls and ceilings, but especially the bedroom has a leak at the north side corner window) and water pressure are fixed, the unit is PROFESSIONALLY cleaned and NEWLY painted, as that's what they took my key deposit for, and most importantly, scrutinize the unit before you move in and demand that they PROPERLY FIX any issues you find to avoid them blaming you when you leave.",1,1,1,1,1

I am going on two years of living in one of his many rentals. The units he owns seem to all be in desperate repair. You must know what your rights are and be prepared to fight for them. Every turn he has tried to con us. Here are just some examples:
1) Tried to charge us because we did not shovel the sidewalk snow in front of the house. We had an argument through email, citing many times over per our lease and the landlord and tenant act outside maintenance is the landlord's responsibility. 
2) Every maintenance request we have filed was an ordeal. After almost two years parts of the house still flood and have extreme water damage during rain. We have sent videos and requests for repair and nothing.
3) Like the other response here. We found mold in the bathrooms and he told us to go buy mold cleaner form Home Hardware and do it ourselves.
4) Times when contractors do come to do repairs we are not notified and they often do a horrible job. We complained that*****
5) When we asked him about getting a pet he said no and that he does not allow pets. We again cited how that is not legal in Ontario and he simply replied back with "" you are right""
6) We had bikes in the backyard that was only accessible through a locked gate. One day when the contractors came to fix a pipe in the backyard, again with no notice, two of the bikes went missing by the end of the day. This has not been remedied yet. 

He is incredibly frustrating as he will try to violate so much of the Landlord and Tenant Act but once you quote it and show him you know he bends. Times when we have spoken he does not know who I am or even what unit the address is. He clearly does not care at all about the properties he owns or the people who are living there.

They enter without notice, slam doors, and leave garbage everywhere. They don't shovel in the winter and leave tenants garbage all over the property in the summer. They make fun of our belongings and our living situation in our hall. They leave our front doors wide open and unlocked and then claim we did it, despite not even being home. We've had intoxicated neighbors and random kids enter our house and when we reported it, they just claimed we had reports against us leaving the doors open. They dump plaster and paint into our own personal garbage bins. They ignore and block maintenance requests by turning off settings on your tenant portal. They are negligent and left the upstairs unit unheated all winter which lead to burst pipes and flooding in our unit.  They did nothing to help us. It took them four days to call a plumber. Somehow, despite coming in and seeing the two inches of water on our floor, because we turned off the water ourselves, they claimed there was no leak. They left drywall all over the floor in the hall,  which we ended up cleaning up after a month because it was covered in mold. It took them three months to patch up the walls. They didn't replace any wet insulation or drywall and told us a mold inspection wasn't necessary. They only did this because they're now renting out upstairs for profit. We expressed concerns about mold within the wall and we were belittled and gaslighted. Amber Lynn is awful. She is unprofessional, dismissive and defensive.

Turns out they converted a single family home without making any of the necessary adjustments. The electrical panel was wired as a single family home, which meant multiple rooms on different floors were on a single circuit. The entire kitchen and half our floor was on the same circuit as downstairs. so the power cut constantly if we used multiple devices at once. We told the landlords and they did nothing. We didn't have access to the breakers, so if the basement tenants were out we were screwed. One weekend it went out and they refused to reset the breaker. They told us to buy an extension cord to power our entire kitchen for the weekend then return it for a refund later.

They blamed us every time something went wrong and any repairs took upwards of weeks, or they didn't happen. The fridge leaked for almost a year before they finally replaced it. The doors were too small for the frame, which meant all of the sound leaked and we had no privacy from the downstairs tenants. We could constantly hear each other. The dryer constantly broke and when they fixed it, they did it with a non-compatible machine and the machines would move when they operated. Our unit would rumble and because the doors were too small the sound drowned out whatever we were doing.

When we decided to move on, they'd either give us an hour's notice that people were coming by to see the unit, or just show up with viewers. We always paid rent on time and told them in advance of any issues. There was a high turnover of renters, and everyone we talked to said it was because of the terrible landlords.

One night this roommate confronted us and threatened us, we were able to get recordings of this incident to show proof to Andrew how uncomfortable and unsafe this living arrangement was and nothing was done.  When the topic of eviction came up, i was told to consider this tenant's mental health and ultimatly the problem tenant was allowed to continue on with his behaviour.


When our house was finally sold to the next landlord, Andrew fibbed and said the landlord's two sons were moving in (even tho it was the landlord himself and one son). I do not think this was miscommunication between the landlord and Andrew because the landlord was surprised nobody knew he was moving in.


 Andrew said he was meant to ""streamline"" interactions between tenant and landlord, but when i had issues with this landlord, Andrew replied  ""Deal with him."" before sending a (much more nicer) worded email to everyone saying he was no longer involved.

We have turf for grass that isn’t properly installed so it blows around and is hazardous. Wood fencing that looks like it was put together by preschoolers. We had a pipe leaking in a wall, the plumber came by to fix it (after we called the landlord who never return emails or phone call) plumber said they had dry walled over the water pipe to turn on and off so they had to shut the entire complexes water off.

While Vic did a lot of  much-needed repair and cleaning in the house, his approaches were invasive and rude. If you worked the day he was going through a  room to clean, he would not give you notification - meaning there was risk to having  your things (shoes, dvds,etc.) Being thrown out.

Vic has little regard for Tenant's boundries and space. He would use the tenants' things even though the agreed rule was we used our own things, and he would argue with you about it.

He would not give you proper***** 

He would impose rules, such as never allowed to do laundry at night, even though it was never a problem for anyone during the years i lived there.

Often Vic would hover or watch his tenants as they made food in the kitchen, making it uncomfortable to cook or clean. 

There is a tenant who may still live at this location; they have plenty of complaints, a drinking problem and as a result they create an unsafe evironment, however Vic has taken no notice or action despite knowing this occurs. 

Vic also has no awareness for those with ""disabilities"", and would berate my other roommate for cleaning despite the fact this roomate had a visual impairment to consider.

- Putting up an ad saying the apartment was available now, when it had not even been treated yet, and my belongings were still in there. This is when she tried to harjass me to get my belongings out before treatment was finished.

They have also ********* the security of the building everyday to ask for information about me instead of getting in contact with me through my emails which he had to contact me along with my number. Building securities supervisor was also there when Garry Harrison broke in back in August of last year and nothing was done to address that breach of privacy and rights. Should have known rights would be violated from the beginning when Sheldon Rakowsky asked for 6 months rent up front on a Draft of a total of 11,900.00 and the next 6 months on post dated cheques. After the first year, rent was covered on post dated cheques and he didn't give me a new rental agreement for the next years and it got in the way of government documentation by making it difficult to get IDs renewed with the address and student information verified. Sheldon Rakowsky has also evicted me without warning or notice and there was nothing I could do about it, they only gave me 3 days to get my belongings and I was to get in touch with Garry Harrison to get access to my stuff within those 3 days. I tried to get in contact and was ignored, the next day Garry Harrison got back to me to tell me within the last 3 days my belongings were removed because I missed the window to get them.

599,DOMUS INC,KITCHENER,N2H 4H6,"I live in a regular apartment (not student housing) that is run by Domus Inc. It seems that the experiences of people who live in their student housing are very different, so this review should only be considered for their non-student housing.

Repair, Health/Safety, Stability and Tenant Privacy Ratings: I would describe them as a very ""hands off"" style of landlord. They do not interfere with tenants and generally do not seem to care what happens on their property. They are responsive when complaints are made and their response time to building maintenance issues is generally adequate, especially for issues inside of tenants' units. The maintenance staff are also very kind and seem to genuinely care about the wellbeing of tenants. However, their repairs in shared areas (stairwells, laundry) or for more labour intensive issues are often band-aid solutions, and the shared areas are often unsanitary. The also run their laundry on an app based system but they do not provide an internet connection in the laundry area, forcing tenants to use their phone data if you want to use the in-building laundry.

Respect Ratings: While my experience living in a Domus building has been much better than my experiences with other landlords, I give Domus a very low rating for tenant respect because of their ******** and shady leasing practices. When you rent a unit, Domus will not actually show you the specific lease for that unit. Instead they will show you a ""standard lease"" which is a generalized lease that could apply to any of their units. Additionally, they put ******** clauses on their leases such as no pets, limited guests, and that you must pay by post-dated cheque or automatic deposit which is ******** to require of a tenant as per the RTA (aside from the payment options, they don't actually enforce any of these ******** clauses). If you are living with a partner or roommate, they also will not allow you to add the second person's name to your lease (I think this is because they use the standardized lease and are too lazy to change it for each unique tenant situation; your partner/roomie can still live with you, but they may be at a legal disadvantage due to their name not being on the lease). They also ask for an ******** key deposit (it is much higher than the actual cost of replacing their keys).",3,3,4,5,1

I'm against the concept of landlords at all, but since I need a place to live I can't believe I lucked out into one like this. While he's not perfect, he's definitely the best landlord I've ever had. He's a little slow on repairs, but not on the stuff that really matters. Like for example we had a busted sink and he was over same day fixing it. Whereas we have a busted bathroom fan and it's been that way for over a year. Health and Safety takes a hit because the slow repairs have resulted in some problems. Like for instance, there's mold in the bathroom that I deal with because the moisture from the shower accumulates due to the lack of ventilation. I clean it with a sponge mop, but I shouldn't have to deal with this at all in my opinion. Fixing the fan would fix this problem completely. So they get a mediocre rating on repairs and health/safety (it's not dangerous, but it's not hospital clean - that's the scale I'm using.) As for the rest, they have great prices, are more than reasonable with their tenants, and even when serving an eviction notice, discuss it a full year in advance to give you plenty of time to get your stuff sorted out.

We agreed to a fair raise in rent if he made some changes to the apartment, to which he agreed. However, he somehow got it in his head that we would seek out companies, arrange for the improvements, pay for them ourselves and then he’d “pay us back,” which was neither agreed upon or appropriate. Once we argued that this was his responsibility, he took months to make the changes and sought out the cheapest, most poorly done changes possible.

Some people don’t get along with her because she has standards for her tenants but for those of us who like to live peacefully, pay our rent, and not cause issues- she’s awesome. There have been a handful of times over the past 15 years I have had to be a little late with rent because of unexpected circumstances - as long as you’re a good tenant and honest with telling her ahead of time… she’s super understanding.

Our rent was always paid weeks or days in advance, and I even bought my own materials to repair things that had broken

Eventually when we found a new place to move, I called the property management to ask how to properly give 2 months notice (it was my first time renting) she told me that I had to give it in writing, so right away I went and wrote out a notice for her and called to ask where to bring it/mail it bit never got an answer, called back many times and left voicemail after voicemail and eventually decided to leave a Facebook message and text message with my notice thinking it would be fine, months later she calls me out of the blue asking how I expect to pay her the ""months of rent I owe' I asked her what she meant and she told her I never gave her notice that I was moving, so I reminded her of out call and all of the other calls I sent with no answers, sbe didnt like that answer and I ended up having to block her

Someone I know actually was meant to go for a viewing there not long after I moved out, I'm not sure if it was the same unit so I could very much be wrong, but I feel like they failed at renting it out in the first few months after I moved and wanted to still make money for those months as they know I'm a very honest and anxious new renter and they might have assumed I'd let them take advantage of me

Flooding frequently occured in the basement, across multiple units.

Interestingly, Tariq did not provide utilities bill, even though I asked at the end of every month. On the last day of my tenancy, while moving out, he gives us the utility bill, which was extremely high (>$8000). This was impossible. I realized that this was almost definitely some kind of scam he was running as I talked to another tenant in the same building who was also given an extremely high utilities bill by him while moving out.

Additionally any email we sent was replied to with a formal tone scrutinizing the littlest of details filled with passive aggressive threats. The landlord is a psychologist and to think she would be manipulating and abusing her rights over young students should be considered against the exact oath she sore to. The day of clean out they talked down on me and the my other house mates infront of our parents because the house wasn’t as clean to their liking. Yet when we moved in the house was a mess, there were earwings and insects all around and as I said before food and crumbs on the floor. Yet they seemed to all of a sudden expect us to clean more when the living conditions the house was given in was FAR worse then what we tried our best to keep it as. Also they are very sly and sneaky and will visit without giving notice. They violated several tenant act agreement rights KNOWING that tenants have more rights than landlords yet abused their power simply on the bases that we are students and easy to take advantage of. We have rights to. I hope no one ever experienced what I went though.

The rent starting point was a wonderful $725 and only went up to $750 in the summer of 2019. However once 2020 came around the company was bought out 3 DIFFERENT TIMES by different companies, the first one raised the rent to $790 still fine, then the next company bought us out and upped the rent to $850 and barely looked after the place. There was no cleaning, there were no inspections of how the place was looking, the apartment building ended up getting bed bugs as a result of how poorly the place was being looked after. These rent price increases kept getting worse and we were only told a week prior, and didn't even tell us where to send the rent until we looked up the company name and ASKED and now this THIRD company came and bought up the property which is the one mentioned above and once again DID NOT look after the apartment we were in and boosted the price to $925.

728,Q RESIDENTIAL,ST CATHARINES,L2N 6T3,"Repairs : It's a corporately held building that since we moved in has gone downhill precipitously. I have encountered problems getting Residential Managers to get things done, often taking a week or more from reporting an issue to receiving assistance. Most recently it was a problem of the sinks in the kitchen not draining. I was having to bail out my sinks like the US has to bail out banks... It took 2 weeks to get a plumber in to fix it, and when he did, it took him about 10 minutes to fix the issue. He also fixed my water pressure issue, no idea how he did it, but he went to ""the mechanical room"" and when he came back, my water pressure was almost back to where it was when we moved in. Pool was closed during COVID, which I understood, but didn't reopen (not because of repairs) until the last week of summer last year, and was open for that ONE WEEK. The pool was the only reason we took this apartment.

Health and Safety: Never had cockroaches before... Just killed my first one in my kitchen today. Black mold on the bedroom ceilings in the winter. Only goes away if I run my Air Conditioner all summer, but inevitably comes back after a few weeks of fall weather.

Rent Stability: Oh the rent is stable. Stable on the increase every year. Whether or not they've done ANY repairs. 

Tenant Privacy Rating: The building has ONE Residential Manager. When I moved in we had 3... She's ill, and is breaking down from having no help for going on 8 months (since our last Residential Manager retired). And is supposed to be not working after April 30th. And as of April 29 she has not been replaced. Our Residential Managers have all been amazing, but one by one, they fell, and no replacements were found... Guess we have no one to call for repairs and such as of May 1st...  They are good about not being overly intrusive with me. But. I think they know better than to bug me too much.

Respect: I don't feel respected when they raise my rent for no reason, cut the amenities, and don't replace the people who make living here easier. I'm not sure I would reccommend this building to my ""friends and family"" I would in fact probably be embarrassed to tell anyone Q Residential runs my building.

741,TOM SCOTT,WINDSOR,N9B 2T8,"F/21 I was a tenant of his for about 6 months before breaking my lease due to domestic violence. This was a student rental accommodation shared with 3 other females. The basement was full of mold and the stairs were not up to code, so bad that my mother slipped off the bottom step and broke her foot. She did not sue as she did not want to cause issues with the landlord at the time. 

Tom was okay with housing a tenant who was $1300 behind on rent and figured the best way to remedy the situation was by refusing to come fix the single functioning toilet in the only bathroom we had. Our fridge went out as well days before the incident and he still refused to come and fix it until her missing rent was paid. 

The tenant who jumped me was the one behind on rent. I kept saying pay your rent to her until she snapped and lunged at me. I do think that tensions were running high in the house as our appliances and toilet were breaking down. It was added stress to us as young students in school. 

I called my parents to let them know I was breaking my lease as the cheques for payment were from their account. My father spoke to Tom about the situation and all he could keep rambling about was how I had an obligation to pay my lease. (I broke the lease legally as domestic violence is one of the top clauses for breaking a lease in Ontario) He kept repeating that he would be getting his $500 monthly no matter what. My father had to tell him that his disregard for the safety of all involved in the altercation was disgusting. He did not ask if everyone was okay, if anyone was injured etc. only cared about where his $500 was coming from. That was when my father started discussing the issues with the bathroom, fridge, with the basement and how my mother had broken her foot. All he could say was “oh I see. Because I won’t let her end her lease you’re going to pick at my house now”. My dad just simply stated that he didn’t appreciate how little this man cared about our health with all the mold and the fact that we had no running toilet for days at a time. 

I moved out within 2 days after the incident, 2 streets over under a different landlord. Tom continued for the next 4 months to attempt depositing my “owed” rent. He never once reached out to me formally to discuss what had happened and instead decided to try taking more money from me/my family. 

He only stopped when we had to put a block on the cheques through our bank and explain the situation to them with proof.

Getting repairs done, whether it was an electrical issue with appliances, a flooding drainage line in the basement from tree roots, a rat infestation in the yard, or various leaks in plumbing leading to damage to drywall and flooring, you could guarantee that it would take ages to address, the work would be the cheapest and shoddiest fix possible (screwing a window with a broken lock shut and writing ""window lock"" beside the screw in marker, putting caulking on a hole in a pipe instead of replacing the section, running extension cords to appliances to avoid fixing broken outlets), and the crews sent to do the work would only be getting paid to fix a single problem per call, even if it was multiple problems they theoretically could resolve.

At one point, after two years of paying the rent in full, promptly and on time, the rent increased (they max it every single year) and we hadn't adjusted our PAD form for the fifteen dollar increase, and they sent us an eviction notice instead of simply calling to resolve the error.

When we finally gave our notice that we were leaving, they listed the full address of our rental on Kijiji, so along with the multiple (four I think?) scheduled showings they set up (often with 2 or more prospective renters at the same time, and once sending 3 couples to our front porch and never actually showing up themselves at all), we also had daily randoms coming up and looking in our front windows, and when we complained about this, they brushed it off like it wasn't a problem.

The best way I can describe them is that they have big city corporate ambitions and attitudes with small town never had to deal with competition unprofessionalism. They have a large share of the absentee landlord market locked down in Windsor, but if you can avoid them, do so.",1,1,1,1,1

There are lots of supporting poles to support the ceiling which is about to fall. It is leaking everywhere, the cement is falling; therefore, there are lots of wholes. It looks scary and unsafe! The tenants in this building is always making fire, so you will get sick and tired of the fire alarms. The tenants are also smoking Marijuana and the smell comes through every hole in the apartment. The management only has money in their eyes. My mom is very sensitive to mold, we start to cough and sneeze every time we come home. There must be some substance in the wall that was not removed!

They even went so far as to threaten me by putting smoke detectors beside the shared door, and without a 24 hour notice! And not because of fire safety, no they were trying to intimidate me and scare me into not smoking indoors which I wasn’t doing to begin with. I also professionally painted the basement kitchen which has a broken window. He didn't say a word, not a single thank you, but the paint job is beautiful and adds value to his  rental unit.

765,MORGUARD NAR CANADA LP,TORONTO,M4H1J3,"Trying to be vague in this review for fear of retribution.  I have lived in my apartment for over a decade so I pay substantially well below current market value thanks to rent control.   For this reason it is nearly impossible to get them to do repairs.  One of the contractors told me when they finally did come to do the repair that they were told by management to only fix the worst part and not replace another part that also should have been replaced years ago.

Some of the repairs they do are done so badly that on several occasions I have to re-do the work after they leave.

Pest control for the building is done by a big name company but they must have a deal with them to do the least work possible so on paper they appear to comply with the landlord tenant act.   I have caught them faking a bug treatment and when I brought it upstairs to management they shrugged their shoulders and said ""yes, we have had reports like this before"".

The building super uses the fire department intercom to make general announcements such as contractor cars parked in wrong spots.   This intercom blasts in every apartment at 200 decibels.   To make matters worse the building super repeats everything twice like the fire department does as if it is really an important thing.

I have a stack of notice of entry papers where they don't even bother to show up.   I like to be home when they enter the apartment so this is extremely annoying when they are a no show.   I have seen them enter my apartment the next day after they missed the day given (they knocked on the door but I sat silently just to see what they would do).   In my opinion this is a form of break and entering.  The super at the time who opened the door for them just blamed the lack of paperwork on the contractors!",1,2,3,2,4

Within six months Rakesh and his wife had relisted the home for $750 more than my parents had been paying. after minimal renovation. Rakesh also asks for two cheques to pay rent, one made out to him and one to his mom, which tbh sounds like tax fraud to me - if you want to partition your money you do it yourself.

When these mechanical issues breakdown, they apply to the new municipal ignorant system favouring landlords, for NON-STANDARD increases to the rents you agree to when you sign on initially - and repairs for your simple living pleasure, will then come out of your pocket (or depending on your finances, potentially leave you unhoused), EVEN, as they make incredible gains in a system that is broken by lack of affordable units in Ontario - and particularly, Toronto.

770,DEREK GREEN,PETERBOROUGH,K9J2V5,"Unit was in subpar condition, but habitable. I got splinters from the floorboards multiple times because they were so worn. There was also a mouse problem. Other than that, my biggest issue was this landlord’s communication. When I told him I couldn’t afford his apartment a month into the pandemic, he was very rude and said “don’t expect to get 24 hours’ notice” for showings. He conducted in person showings despite public health officials’ recommendations, which I had flagged for him, and despite the fact that many if not most other landlords were doing virtual showings at that time. I offered to film a complete walkthrough for prospective tenants, but he said my choice was to either deal with strangers walking through my house or pay him the $1500 he was concerned about losing. He had three weeks to find new tenants by the way.

If you do everything exactly as this man wants, you will likely have few issues, but know he is quick to anger and will become oppositional if challenged. Based on the direct quote above, he also takes a flippant attitude toward tenant rights when they inconvenience him (and yes, he did end up doing showings with less than 24 hours’ notice).",3,2,4,4,2
771,MEHRI FALLAH & PEGAH OGHABI,TORONTO,M4W1M4,"I want to stick to the facts so that nobody ever rents from this mother daughter duo. 
We lived at 825 Church for almost 4 years when we were handed an N12. Not for a minute did we believe they were being honest but we didn’t want to fight. Instead, we kept an eye on the unit in the event that they were in fact lying. During our tenancy, they regularly showed us that they had very little understanding of their responsibilities as a landlord. They tried to charge us “the first $50 of any repair” when the track lighting needed to be fixed, they included a no dog clause in one of the schedules attached to the lease, they tried to withhold the one months rent owing to us as part of the N12 for potential repairs, attempted to have us pay for our last month rent accusing us of not paying for one of the months during our tenancy, and tried to avoid paying us interest on our last months rent claiming “they’d never paid any other tenant any interest”. Thankfully, we were well versed on our rights as tenants and didn’t get swindled by them. The condo was a brand new building. We complete the initial inspection on move in and marked up the walls for them to have them repaired. We dealt directly with the condo when our track lighting broke and took great care of the unit. Every single rent cheque was cashed and paid on time. We were model tenants. 

Turns out that they were lying when they gave us the N12. They ended up signing a 3 year lease with a luxury rental company and got an extra $500/month in rent from them. Thanks to our detective skills, we compiled evidence to prove they gave us the N12 in bad faith and sued them at the LTB and won. They had to pay all our moving expenses and the difference in rent for a full year, nearly $10k. I would have been happy with $0 if it meant they would never be landlords again. Alas, we knew we couldn’t prevent that but we know we caused them a lot of grief. Hopefully this site and this review helps someone too.",3,5,1,5,3

This includes; removing amenities, attempting to make us pay more than the lease agreement for air conditioning in lump sum ahead of time (including tenants who do not have AC as a separate charge). If we don't agree to pay they have said they will remove the AC unit at cost of the tenant.

781,SKYLINE LIVING (SEAWAY TOWERS),WINDSOR,N8S 1E8,"Constantly find excuses to enter your apartment.  It's only April, and they've already entered my apartment five times this year, for a whole sundry of reasons.  Landlords should only be entering once a year for checking fire alarms/smoke detectors, and then only coming in if I request repairs, not to constantly fiddle with the water tank and the hydro meter and the windows.  Also, they just put window limiters up, so since we don't have AC, we will probably succumb to heat stroke come summer.  They claim it's a safety issue.  But when I complained that rainwater is pouring in through the exhaust vent above my ELECTRIC stove and soaking it and my kitchen floor whenever it rains, they refuse to do anything to fix it because ""it would cost too much to rent a crane to go up the side of the building to cover the vent.""

The breaking point was when she moved back to the city and realized how high rent had gotten, and began seeking reasons to evict me so she could renovate and re-rent for more. She started throwing accusations including things like keeping the front sunroom too messy (this was a shared space, and most of the mess was old supplies she had left there), and paying rent late when the rent had been paid on time via EMT, she just didn't deposit it on time. :S  In a fury one day she discarded everything out of the sunroom including a pair of boots and several coats of mine.

796,VINCENZO COMMISSO,HAMILTON,L8P 2S2,"When I was shown the home, Vincenzo (""Vince"") and his wife Angelina seemed like a dream come true. They were polite, friendly, helpful, and just seemed like the kind of folks who would never present any issue. I would be renting in a house, starting with one upstairs roommate and two more empty bedrooms on my floor, that might get filled. I was fine with that. I moved in around March 1st 2016. There were a few growing pains, but nothing I considered out of the ordinary for a new rental (we were his first tenants) and new tenant/LL relationship.

That all changed the morning of 13 April, I woke up to strange noises coming from downstairs. I went down to the kitchen and found the noises were coming from the unfinished basement. I feared someone had broken into the house. I found it was actually construction contractors. Vince had decided to do work on the basement without letting me or my roommate know (24 hours' notice required). He also had not told the *contractors* that he hadn't told us they were coming, and for their part the workers actually supported our shocked and angry response. They were also hugely embarrassed by what happened and on Vince and Angelina's behalf. This also meant we could not use the laundry facilities, which were part of our lease. We were told the work would take ""10 days"". By May 31st, it had been 49 days and the work was still ongoing. Construction was to take place weekdays, Monday to Friday between 8am and 4:30pm. It also took place outside these hours, and Vince would show up unannounced on weekends with construction workers in tow. Initially the work specified was to ""underpin the existing rubble foundation"" and ""install weeping tile"". Past a certain point our relationship and communication deteriorated and he would not explain what other work he was doing. I noted at one point that the wall insulation was touching the hot water tank on two sides and the furnace on one side. The construction was so loud, we couldn't sleep or were woken up. My girlfriend stopped visiting due to the noise level, and my roommate and I both stopped having friends visit.

He did not provide us with a garbage can until evening 29 May / morning 30 May. So between March and June, he blamed his tenants for ""not taking out the garbage"" when in fact the city workers would refuse to collect the garbage from the curbside unless it was in a garbage can. No green bin (composting) was ever provided that I recall. Also when I first moved in, the blue bins (recycling) were filthy and full of assorted pieces of wood; this had to be dumped out and stored (lest the landlord accuse us of destroying or dumping his property), and then the bins had to be cleaned.

There were no carbon monoxide detectors present (as required by law) when we moved in, these did not appear until 24 March. When they did appear, they were the plug-in kind. CO detectors for tenant units are supposed to be hardwired into the electrical grid with battery back-ups. There were smoke detectors installed before we moved in, but the batteries were dead. I bought batteries myself and was never compensated. There also was no smoke detector on the upstairs roommate's floor, and to my knowledge one was never installed. No smoke detector or CO detector in the basement; not sure if they were installed after it was finished. No CO detector on the ground floor. Also when detectors were finally ""provided"" he left them on the kitchen counter still in their packaging, we had to install them ourselves. 

On 20 April I asked Vince for his email address; I never received it. I don't think there's a legal obligation for him to provide it, but I was trying to facilitate communication and thought it was a reasonable request. I also asked for a phone number and email for Angelina. Eventually got an email, but no phone number, and she said she only checked the email ""every couple days"". God forbid something important come up.

When we saw him in person and we made comments, complaints, asked questions, raised concerns etc., he never wrote any of it down.

The refrigerator had a built-in water dispenser which leaked, causing water to seep out from under the bottom of the fridge. This was never addressed.

We conflicted over access to, privacy in, and responsibility for common spaces. Vince's view was that we were renting our bedrooms (or in the upstairs roommate's case, the entire attic suite), and that the common spaces were not ""ours"". Yet if the common spaces were not ""ours"", he would not take responsibility as though they were ""his"", refusing to provide such items as a broom, mop, vacuum, dustpan, or dustbuster for months. The rented space being ""limited to a bedroom only"" was not mentioned on the tenancy agreement, I never agreed to it verbally, nor was it discussed when I viewed the home, or when I came to sign the lease. 

Various HVAC vents were stuck throughout the home, and the furnace/AC was inoperable for several days, in 30+ degree Celsius heat. I later found out that he had been lying about it being broken, when in fact he had turned it off intentionally using a switch on the wall. It actually worked fine, he just didn't want to pay the bill which he was responsible for. He also tried to tell us what we could and could not set the temperature at.

The place was advertised as ""furnished"" and, as I mentioned, Vince said he ""owned"" the common spaces, yet he did not provide a tablecloth, coasters, placemats, or curtains. Not that I required the tablecloth and stuff, but I also didn't want to damage his furniture. The furniture feet had no felt on them, so we had to be careful not to damage the floors. No iron or ironing board, no oven mitts, no microwave, no toaster, no shoe rack, no bath mat, no stoppers/plugs for the tub and bathroom sink. Upstairs roommate bought a toaster and microwave herself, and (rightly) took them with her when she left. She attributed her departure to, among other factors, gender-based harassment and other harassment she faced from Vince.

No coat rack; I had a coat rack that my mom had gotten me, but not a screwdriver or screws, and anyway at this point I was leery of ""damaging"" VInce's walls in case he got angry about it.

""Inspections"" and entry without notice; he would repeatedly show the empty rooms on 3 hours' notice, repeatedly enter the basement without any notice at all. The basement had a separate side exterior entrance, which had a lock. Then from there you could go down a set of stairs into the basement or up a set of stairs through a door into the part of the house where we lived. This door between the basement and upstairs did not have a lock on it -- meaning that despite the basement eventually being a fully finished suite with its own kitchen and bathroom, the downstairs roommate would have full access to the rest of the house, despite Vince saying otherwise.

The stove was a gas stove and we never received any confirmation that it was safe or approved for use. Not a fan of gas stoves in general as I came home at one point in the early hours of the morning and someone had left the gas on with the stove off. (It was not the upstairs roommate as she had had enough and moved out at this point, but several others had moved in.) I can't blame Vince for someone else leaving the gas on, but as I said, we never received word that it was okay to use in the first place. Anyway I vented the home and nobody died, yay.

About developing the basement, he told us to our faces that he ""didn't know what he wanted to do with it"", then I overheard him talking outside to someone about showing her the basement and renting it out, so he lied to us about that.

After a certain point when he kept coming into the house without any notice, I literally called the cops. The cops claimed it was a civil matter and not something they could intervene with. But they did point out that it looked nothing like a ""rooming house"" as he claimed.

Then he brought up renoviction and relativiction, gobbing off about how he could kick any of us out at any time if he decided he wanted to work on our rooms/spaces or have his daughter live in the house while she was in college, or have his dad move into the house for whatever reason. Just absolutely gross harassment and nonsense. We got a threatening letter from his fancy lawyer up in Toronto. I called the lawyer back and the lawyer never returned my call, probably because he knew they didn't have a legal leg to stand on. I was frankly surprised the lawyer agreed to write the letter in the first place given he must have known how much trouble it could get them all into. 

Vince demanded post-dated cheques for rent (which I had not realized are actually illegal in Ontario), yet he would not provide proper rent receipts. He repeatedly and proudly referred to the building as a ""half-a-million-dollar house"", but clearly hadn't bothered with inspecting it and acted like anything we asked him to do that could possibly cost him any money at all was financially impossible or extremely difficult (such as issuing proper rent receipts - like, are you trying to tell us you can afford multiple houses but can't afford a printer and a few sheets of paper?). The receipts didn't even have his name on them.

It was clear they hadn't bothered with inspecting the house, because every little detail we brought up - and even the big, blatant, obvious things that nobody could fail to miss walking by - to do with the house, they acted like it was a complete and total surprise and shock to them. I can't blame them for the way the house was before they bought it, but it was their job to inspect it and make sure it was up to snuff before putting it on the rental market and letting us move in. Like the smoke detector batteries, that cost me $20. I asked them, would they want another landlord to treat their daughter like this? Or Vince's dad?

The dryer squeaked. The dryer, that was in the basement, squeaked so loudly you could hear it in the attic loft, with all the intervening doors closed. Oh, and the dryer also ran on gas, and squeaking to me always implied metal on metal, which implied the possibility of sparks, which did not seem to me like a good thing with a gas dryer. 

I offered to mend the relationship, but they weren't interested, asking me to move out instead. On the previous occasion where police attended (after I called them), the officers noted to me that none of the rooms were individually numbered; there were no separate mailboxes; two of the bedrooms shared a vent; etc., i.e. there was no reasonable way to construe the accommodation on reflection as anything resembling a ""rooming house"" as Vince and his wife tried to claim it was. 

In general, Vince seemed to make a habit of agreeing to things and then forgetting or disregarding them. I told them I was going to start recording any conversations we had in person. 

Oh, also one of the post-dated cheques bounced and they tried to make an issue over the NSF fee ($75), but dropped it when I said I'd learned that stipulating post-dated cheques was illegal, and that they violated the law and my rights by not providing information about the Landlord and Tenant Board, and our respective rights and responsibilities, when I moved in -- despite knowing that I was a new resident to Ontario. If they'd provided that information, that would have prevented any question of an NSF fee. 

By the end of it, Vince stopped talking to me entirely and I was dealing with Angelina. She denied receiving post-dated cheques (like we didn't have an entire text message convo between me and Vince talking about it), and characterized my emails as ""threats"". (If it's threatening to know and discuss your legal rights, call me a threatener, I guess.) I had to spend fifty bucks to buy new cheques from the bank, too.",1,1,1,1,1

807,BOB PERKS,KITCHENER,N2N3R1,"We rented an executive townhouse, we were in the 2nd unit in. There were 6 units in total, I'm numbering them 1-6 starting from the left most unit. Bob ""hired"" the tenant in unit 6 to manage this property. These units were all advertised as ""executive townhouse for families"".Within the first week it became very apparent that unit 1 was rented by 4 people in their late teens/early 20's. 2 of the four were a couple that argued and threw objects while fighting at the shared wall. The bedroom wall was shared with our 5 year old son. From Thursday to Sunday they had non stop parties with the stereo cranked until 4 or 5am, and police regularly called not just from the noise, but their guests were parking in other people's driveways, passing out on lawns and even a few times on patio furniture they removed from other peoples yards. The police were already fed up before we moved here and had stopped responding and referred everyone renting to landlord tenant board, and other property owners to the city or lawyers.
The tenants in unit 3 (we met at the school, our son and their daughter started jk together) and we walked them to school together almost daily, after the first week or two they let us know the previous 2 tenants in our unit complained about the tenants in unit one and were forced to break the one year lease and move in less then 6 months because Bob refused to do anything other then refer everyone to speak to the manager in unit 6. Unit 3 had regularly complained as well since they could hear the music and banging from unit 1, it was quite literally so loud in unit 2 that they heard it clearly in unit 3. When unit 2 sat empty the manager said it was loud to unit 3 because it was echoing in the empty unit.
By the end of the third week we were regulary packing up our 5 year old and 7 month old and slept in the basement Thursday to Sunday with ear plugs in and a mobile running non stop to try and drown out some of the sounds from next door.
Bob asked us to mediate with unit 1 and the manager. Manager said for us to go and knock when they were being ""too loud for the babies"" and ask them to keep it down. The way she said it I'm confident she meant us and not the children. Thursday rolls around and I gave it until midnight to go and ask the to keep it down. Knocked and rang the bell for 10 minutes until someone was leaving and let me in. I stood in the doorway uncomfortably until a very drunk girl came and said she was one of the ones who paid. I assume she meant rent but she was quite hammered and could have thought I was delivering pizza since she tried to tip me and offered me a drink. When her boyfriend clued in he came over and told me to ""have a beer and chill the f@#% out"", and told me how they disconnected the door bell because of the cops and everyone showing up and pointed at the lines of coke on the kitchen counter and winked. Wow. I just repeated I've got 2 kids under 5 and we need to sleep, please lower the volume. It was turned down, by next to nothing, I walked out and got to my door to hear everyone laugh and the stereo turned up louder then it was before. Friday night I was back at midnight, this time their front door was wide open so I walked in to find the manager (in her 50's clearly trying to recapture her youth) doing coke with a bunch of 20 year olds. It was clear at this moment we would be also breaking our lease.
Found out Bob had signed contracts with the utility provider to have regulators put on the furnace to shut it off during high peak times. I found out first day there when my air-conditioning didn't turn on in 35° weather while trying to unpack. He did everything he could to save a dime and it was always at his tenants expense, even when utilities were not included! I had to buy a couple of portable air conditioners for during the day when the central air didn't work.
Second month in I gave our notice, my son's teacher called us several times because he kept falling asleep in class because of the chaos we were forced to listen to. We moved here from 3 hours away and had no friends or family in the area, and we couldn't afford to stay in hotels so we were left with no option. Bob didn't appreciate that I served him this paperwork at the real estate office he worked at. He was very angry and demanded I speak to him in front of everyone there and asked me what was the issue and I explained (what I said above) and several more lovely moments we had, including not being able to use our yard with bottles and drug bags (sometimes still containing product) made it unsafe for our kids and was utter BS for almost $3,000 a month. (Westmeadow Drive, lower upperclass neighborhood at that time). The strange people on my patio and in my back yard, etc. Since he wanted to discuss it at that moment his coworkers heard everything and that's when I found out one of the tenants in unit 1 he told them was his daughter (later found out not his daughter but sugarbaby and saw explosive fight when he caught her with someone her age and the manager who he was also ""dating"").
After notice was given Bob sent his son 3 or 4 times a week to ""inspect or show"" the unit with no notice, and quite often forgot to bring people with him to ""show the unit to"". 
We were able to move with 3 weeks overlap of both places. On the first Thursday of the overlap we stayed at the new place and came back Sunday evening to missing boxes, damaged property and our kids piggy banks smashed and money gone. (Sentimental value as these were built by a relative that passed away a month before we moved and devastatedmy oldest). Bob told me the manager hired the tenants from unit 1 to clean up our unit and must have given them the wrong date. 
If this man's name is on your lease, RUN. It was an utter nightmare to live through and I found out with the tribunal he started putting his properties in his kids names to make it harder to sue him as this was one of MANY properties he had ""a daughter"" at.
Ask before signing a lease if the name on there is the manager/owner/caretaker. When you have to deal with the tribunal its a hassle and adds a year (before covid) to the process to track down who is actually responsible for the property.",1,1,1,1,1

He also shared my personal information with my neighbours, misgendering me and revealing to them that myself and my partner are LGBTQ. He keeps the building as cold as he is legally allowed and slacks off on snow removal. When I moved out, he had a new tenant (with a young child) in my unit before my lease was up, before I had even moved all my belongings out or given my key back.

There have been countless building superintendents, property managers and companies in charge of this place literally it can change weekly you get notices of someone new who has come in and they are all useless and some of them are literal criminals with warrants out or straight out of halfway houses. They don’t fix anything here. They updated the electrical because it was more than 100 years old and just placed new wiring on the outside of the walls and left massive holes several feet long inside tenants units opening directly into the inside of the walls that were not repaired, mold and bugs everywhere. These units are so flimsy you can literally hear everything that happens in other units and the tenants are also so disrespectful and constantly loud but the buildings don’t care, main buildings  front doors are open and broken for months on end and homeless people are often found sleeping in the hallways directly in front of tentants doors. Rent is also not stable or controlled - they have illegally raised the rent every year Inclduing the rent freeze year they still sent notices of an increase when should have been 0 and the next year increase was triple the legal limit and it has just kept happening then they send you eviction or arrears notices.

Building is totally infested with cockroaches and very little is done about them despite numerous complaints. The infestation is so bad, that they've practically taken over my unit, destroyed my oven, and caused the bathroom fan to stop working. Despite the unit being in clear disrepair, nothing has been done about it despite sending work orders. They're constantly trying to evict us over the stupidest of things, whether it's because my special needs children are being ""too loud"" during their meltdowns, ODSP not paying the right amount and the landlord demands I pay the full rent amount rather than the difference owed, or being blamed for the roach infestation that they've done very little about and are trying to make ME pay for all the renovations and maintenance that is THEIR responsibility to do in the first place. Despite the landlord staring at the security cameras 24/7, he somehow has a problem with me taking out my trash ""one-too-many times"", but not the drug addicts that I've caught about smoke crack in front of the entrance and had to shoo away. During unit inspections, they'll take a photo of my recycling bin having a couple of plastic bottles and call that ""clutter"". Simply put, if the landlord doesn't like you for whatever reason, he makes it very personal and tries to evict you by any means necessary, and even by illegal means.

You know this place is going downhill when they have to merge with a bigger housing company to keep themselves from sinking, AND get a housing official that works for the city of Cambridge to inspect the place, who was called in by the elementary school next door because a roach decided to stowaway in my kid's lunchbag.

Highlights include: Ineffective pest control resuling in long term ( over 6 months) german roach infestations (multiple units/floors).  We have had several security breaches where property has been taken- they have done nothing. It seems likely that the reason is to drive tennants out early for demoviction purposes. They have already applied to rebuild on this lot. During pandemic (when many tennants were exclusively working from home) they started multiple unit demolishments WITHOUT PERMITS to cause extreme noise distress for weeks. They are extremely poor communicators and tennants can expect suprises in general. A minor point: small community initiatives in our building: free item swap area, mini laundry library and holiday door decorations seem to be a preoccupation for this company and well worth their time to trash/ remove or harass tennants about.

849,SKYLINE LIVING,BRANTFORD,N3P 1K6,"My review reflects on Skyline Living, not on any specific Resident Manager. 
I have lived at this location for 5 years as of May 1, 2023. Within that 5 years, I have lived in two different units. First unit was a 1 bedroom, and then we later upgraded to a 2 bedroom. Upon moving into our 2 bedroom apartment, we were signing a lease agreement and for some unknown reason the Resident Manger (at the time) felt it was necessary to assure us that ""there has never been a cockroach issue in that unit, but we exterminated the unit before your move-in date"" - Keep in mind, we didn't ask that question. 
About 3 weeks into living in the new unit, I'd wake up in the middle of the night to get a drink or use the washroom, only to be jumping over cockroach obstacles. I notified the Resident Manager right away, where we were then put on a list for a dusting extermination. This was back in 2021. It is currently 2023, and we are STILL battling the cockroaches. My partner and I both have contacted the Regional Manager of Skyline only for her to brush us off. We have expressed that this is is a building wide issue and that the entire building needs to be exterminated to put this pest issue to rest, but we get told ""it's too expensive"" as a response. We currently pay just shy of $1,800/month PLUS utilities. There are 83 units in the one building alone (there's two buildings on site). Hypothetically speaking, if it costed 10K to have the building exterminated and those 83 units were rented out at $1,600 each, that's a profit of $132,800 MONTHLY in Skylines pocket, but ""it's too expensive"" to exterminate cockroaches so their residents can live comfortably????

In that, time offers were made to 2 units for repairs with the agreement our rent would almost double after completion.  Now keep in mind these renovations were actually repairs that were in desperate need of completion.  Our unit agreed. Paperwork was completed based on the work being completed in a timely manner and remember the word “completed”.  Work began in our kitchen the middle of May 2022 and we were told one week to complete everything maximum.  Fast forward 6 weeks later with no kitchen.  A parade of various “workers “ coming at all hours of the day and night.  Some of which we discovered had criminal records when the police showed up and one of them fled our place by jumping the backyard fence and leaving.  By the beginning of July we had a functional kitchen of you call it that.  Not up to much standard but we felt we had no choice to accept this.  Bathroom renovations began in October.  What an ordeal.  Contractors, if you can call them that didn’t bother to show up until late afternoon and completely gutted our bathroom. We were told in order for it to be completed, they would have to stay until the early hours of the morning or they would leave and go back to their office in Windsor and they didn’t know when they would be back. Well common sense would prevail that if your townhouse unit only has one bathroom in it you have no choice but to accept this to the.  To this date April 29/23 our bathroom has still not 100% been completed. The work that was done was not done properly and we have submitted numerous texts and emails to the owner and the maintenance departments none of which have been responded to. We now get threatening emails every month by being issued N4s because we paid our rent but we pay the original lease amount and not the amount that the owner is expecting- when the renovations should have been completed. We have told this person multiple times that we have no problem paying the new amount when the job is done. She refuses to reach out to us by text, email or even phone call and all communication has broke down. This company and this woman have property all over Windsor, Sarnia, Corunna, London, and St. Thomas Ontario.  They have clearly taken on more than they can handle because they don’t deal with anything.  We are reasonable people to get along with, and all we have ever asked for from her in the beginning, was respect and open communication, we’ve given it and not been given it back. Sad that people think this is acceptable. I’m not one to badmouth people by any means, but I’m on here just to make people aware- stay away from this company.

However, by the next month, the Landlord stopped using the Property Management company and we were told that we were to deal directly with the Landlord.  He seemed ok at first, but, when we noticed that he lied about our Enbridge, Hyrdro and water bills and let him know that he had purposely deceived us, he didn’t apologize or claim that he made an error.  That was just the beginning of the horrific ordeal that we experienced with this Landlord.  We had to ask over and over again to have items fixed which were very essential to having a safe living environment.  I mean, what doesn’t someone understand when it is the winter and the furnace isn’t working? How many times does someone have to ask to have a toilet replaced because it doesn’t work? These are basic and essential to living in a safe environment.  Not to mention the rats that were in our backyard, ants everywhere in the house, bugs in the basement, wiring and breaker boards that had not been kept up properly, window screens that were either non-existent or in need of replacing, and many more issues that shows that this Landlord should be never allowed to rent to anyone ever again!  How about  The final showing up unannounced at the house and demanding to be let in so he could “check out” the premises and then hand us a N11 and demand that we sign it or he wouldn’t leave!!!!  When we wouldn’t sign this bogus N11 he freaked out and we told him to leave or we would call the police.  The Landlord also tried to evict us by giving us a N13 saying that he needed us to leave the premises because he was putting the house up for sale and that he needed to do renovations and fix it up in order to sell.  Finally, the Landlord hired a Paralegal to his dirty work.  When we were informed that the Landlord wanted to come and “inspect” the premises again, even though he was at the premises 2 weeks before, we were informed that the Landlord would be changing the locks because he didn’t like our reply!!!!  This is illegal when the tenant is currently occupying the rental house.  We informed the Paralegal as such but it took over 2 days for the Paralegal to get the picture when we informed him that if the Landlord comes and changes the locks we would call the police.  All this stress took a toll on our mental health along with the constant harassment and threats.  We ended up moving out. Even after we moved out and some mail came that we wanted to pick up, we asked the Paralegal if we could come an pick it up.   The Paralegal, on behalf of the Landlord, demanded that we pay and that we give him our new address and other personal information in order for the Landlord to give us our mail.  We had to file a complaint to the police and it was only after the police contacted the Paralegal that we were able to get our mail.  order for us to get our mail. DO NOT EVER rent any house or whatever else that has anything to do with this Landlord.  As well, this Landlord has several other names that he goes by as well as the one that is listed on this rating, one being Ketha and another one is Sinnappu Ketha.  We have no idea what this Landlord’s real name is but be aware and steer clear of this person. This whole experience turned out to be an utter nightmare.

They paint the walls of graffiti, but do nothing to deter the addicts gaining entry and making a wild mess of things. It's unsafe. There's no peace. I dream of the day when I get out of here. Incessant demands for financial checks, threatening eviction once every 6 months. It's too much.

The super assured me when I went to see the place that there had never been an issue with cigarette smoke. Once I moved in I found out that this was not true and that many tenants had reported having problems with cigarette smoke in their unit. The A/C and the supplementary heat were unusable because it piped in cigarette smoke from smokers who are in the building from before it went 'non-smoking'.

Also the office manager is known to give people who work from home a hard time. She is an obstructive bully and if you go over her head to head office you will be met with further resistance from her superior.  I understand that tenants have left Westdale because of bullying from these two individuals.

Hasn't been the worst experience, current landlord also not the worst but not the best. Have to push to get certain repairs done. Windows are a disaster. Lots of the repairs done are cheaply done, Bandaid fixes. Had major ant issues summer and fall 2022 - landlord ignored at first telling tenants it was their fault, clean better. Never had any issues in 6 years, only when they do cleaning/repairs of outside of building there becomes a problem. Rumors of bed bugs. 
Many tenants with dogs are ignorant owners - don't consider others around them and don't pick up poop, some take their dogs to parking garage to do their business. One REALLY annoying tenant in 102-2767 very loud daily and very nosey in everyone's business.
Office assistant has been the same for YEARS. Sweet kind lady(Olga)Best part of this property from Paramount. Building management has daily cleaning of all floors done however a few things that could be better - laundry rooms seem to get highly ignored for cleaning. Frustrating the cleaners put elevator on hold while cleaning floors especially during the morning when everyone is going for work or taking dogs out, would be great to see them wait for an elevator to come back instead of holding one of the two elevators.
Landlord has also put a lot of money into upgrading their office to a nice modern-day look, even adding a back deck from their office... Would have been nice to see as much effort into the over-priced apartments that look like they're from the 70s still.",2,2,3,4,3

These landlords were constantly wanting to come in to our unit for example saying they wanted to check the unit every 6 months which i understand that a yearly check maybe would be reasonable as  we are two grown calm adults not distorting everything and I know that these checks are done to make sure everything is in order  but this was brought up AFTER we had moved in and not prior or mentioned on the contract. The landlords started complaining that our GARBAGE which was kept in the garage as was another tenants and the landlords garbage but for some reason it was OUR garbage that smelt as if garbage is not suppose to smell. 
(The landlords 2 lived upstairs with their mother 1 and three to four children) in the basement they had two units with my husband and I in one and another gentlemen’s in the other. 
The house started smelling like weed sometimes while we were living there and the landlords were adamant it was one of the two units down stairs because it smelt like it was coming from downstairs but part of the basement was also not accessible from downstairs but was from upstairs and was a space the landlords and their kids used. The wall between that basement space was shared with our unit and we can hear everything down when they came. The daughter would come down a lot and pretend to work out as she would tell her parents but I was able to smell the weed at that time. It was her daughter smoking in the house not any of the downstairs tenants. 
These landlords proceeded to install cameras inside the house when you come in through the side door which was the downstairs tenant main entrance. Mind you they did not have cameras outside the house. Living in this house felt like we were constantly being controlled and some ridiculous issues were always coming up (being made up by the landlord) even though we were following the rules set out on the contract and we’re NEVER not once late on rent or anything.

The paint in the bathroom is peeling, the countertop is sagging, the faucet at the back of the counter is held in 100% by solicone because it's deteriorated. Missing a layer of sliding windows.  1 of the 3 radiators doesn't work. Balcony door is drafty. These are ALL things I've been told ""will be done when  you move out"".
Sure, if you have a ""real issue"" like water not running they'll come fix it, but they absolutely refuse to work on anything else in my unit or give us a unit transfer to a new one at the same price. They want us to pay a few hundred more, or continue living in this degregated unit. 
During the yearly inspection the superintendant came and took photos of all the ""damage"" I've previously put in requests for, then tried to submit an eviction notice claiming it was us to cause all of those issues. I pointed out that the last page of the eviction wasn't filled out by the LTB and requested it to be filed properly and they never tried to evict us again. Absolutely terrible, no respect for long term existing tenants, they just want us out to make a few hundred more a month. We're not going ANYWHERE.",1,1,1,4,2

However, if you remind him of his legal duties as a landlord, or push back when he attempts to use his position to intimidate you, he will quickly lose his temper. He does not want to invest a single cent into his property, leaving windows cracked and moldy, bathroom tiles loose, paint peeling, and countertops in poor condition. The apartment is not well insulated and the windows are old and drafty, resulting in an average indoor temperature of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius during the winter.

First of all they changed the terms of the agreement to suit themselves whenever they felt like it. They lived upstairs and I rented the basement and the door in between would only lock from their side. When they wanted ti they just walked in and came into my home on many many occasions. The kitchen was totally out of code and the kitchen cabinets were so close to the ceiling that they actually caught fire on the pot light. 
They never helped me shovel the way into the basement and refused to cover the stairs so I was constantly shoveling upwards. They told me that my children couldn’t go in the backyard and all but that is how we walked into the apartment. I had two parking spots and one day came home to find a boat parked in my spot and was told it was no longer my spot

The maximum amount of time they give you for notice on anything is 24 hours. Even if you're doing a bed bug prep, it's only ever 24 hours. They have entered my apartment without providing notice before. I was told to just, ""Call management and complain"". They are constantly looking for excuses to intrude into your apartment. There is zero privacy in that building.

In addition to pests, there is a big black mold problem that they never fix. If you ever want to notify management about anything, you have to directly speak to the superintendent Mike. He refuses to do any correspondence through email or through text. It all has to be in person, verbally. He doesn't want a record of any interactions on paper, in case he gets brought to the landlord tenant board, he doesn't want anyone having any proof of any of the things he does.

When I moved out, they tried to charge me with a whole bunch of spurious claims of damage to the apartment. There was a little bit of a mess that I cleaned up, and that was about it. When I got a lawyer involved, they dropped all the charges.

Avoid this place at all costs, as they will not respect your privacy, they will intrude into your apartment, you will have pests from the moment you move in, and they don't handle noise complaints at all, of which there is a ridiculous amount of noise in that building.",1,1,1,1,1

1. Threatened with eviction for not following unwritten/unposted ""rules""
2. Threatened with eviction for their own paperwork mistakes
3. Threatened with eviction for denying them access to my unit after receiving illegal entry notices

Every time I call the main office to talk about these issues or maintenance, they ask if I've spoken to the on-site property manager. When I respond that after my prior interactions with him that I will not speak with him, they concede that I'm not the only tenant who's taken that stance and they know there are issues with him. The office manager for this property never returns phone calls and somehow is never in the office when I call at any hours of the work day. When there are issues with winter maintenance (parking lot ice that both myself and my child have fallen on) I'm told they're having issues with the contractor. Not my problem, Eiwo is ultimately responsible and needs to figure it out. There is no accountability or sense of responsibility at Eiwo. I have been renting in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for over 15 years and Eiwo is by far the worst I have dealt with so far.

I'm not a difficult tenant to deal with. Screws came loose on my door knob, fixed it myself. Cheap cupboard door fell off, fixed it myself. Toilet flapper leaking, fixed it myself. Fuses, light bulbs, smoke alarm batteries, I handle all of it myself. I was raised in rentals and my parents always handled whatever they could before asking the landlord to look after it. The only significant issue I've asked Eiwo to deal with in the unit is sewage backing up into the basement. Which has been a repeated problem for the past 2 years! Instead of fixing the actual pipes they just keep calling in a company to snake the drains when someone complains about them backing up again.

The windows aren't sealed correctly and leach humidity into the walls and cause black mold to form. There's black mold on our blinds.

1035,DEVI,RICHMONDHILL,L4C3G8,"This is rated based on the last year we lived there. She was good up until she had to sell the house. Devi hired a real estate agent to take over. She refused all communication with us. She gave us a false promise that she was going to help us find a place to live but never did. She also did not want us to leave until her house was sold and put us in a situation with children to have 3 months to leave or POSSIBLY be able to stay. We didn’t want to take that chance and wanted to move. We asked her if we could use her as a reference she said yes and made a letter for me. When my real estate agent found us a house we didn’t get the place because SHE TALKED HORRIBLE ABOUT US! So we couldn’t move early. We lived there for about 10 years! Had a good relationship and understanding for a long time. The tiles in the bathroom fell and she wanted us to fix the tiles and lied to me that the downstairs gave her the cock to put on the tiles. The basement people were violent and abusive. She aloud them to live there and they were vulgar. Screaming and yelling breaking our kids toys (electric car) and waved a tool in my face. I asked about the tool to use for the tiles. I ruined the tool because I am licensed and I didn’t know how to fix the wall. When we did finally move she tried to come after me for damages. The walls were peeling due to the paint that was used, and the tiles were falling. She also didn’t give us our interest every year nor gave me receipts.

I forced her to have things in e-transfer because she did lie to me about money. I came straight from the bank with cash money in the envelope. She wouldn’t count in front of me and said we can be friends you don’t need the receipt. After she closed the door she quickly re opened it and said I was missing money somehow. I was always upset about that. So I forced e-transfers. I was glad to because when I was paying utilities she would lie a few time oh I didn’t pay the portion. Then realized I was pregnant and said oh I see it here never mind. 

She aloud the real estate agent come every single day and forced us out of the house everyday because they had viewings everyday. We had to look into our rights to stop them from being invasive and not kick us out with kids pregnant during winter time everyday because of viewings. 

Devi told us that we didn’t have to pay full rent on the first but pay majority and then a few days later the rest. She said to be helpful and be able to give us a break from anything. She used that against us saying we don’t pay rent on time even know that was a verbal agreement. She was nice enough to allow us to have internet under her name and we paid her the 100$ every month.

She was trying to get access to the elevator to move in and, after being rude to her, he made us give him $100 to use the elevator as a ""security deposit"", money which he refused to return to us until we argued with him. ""Who you gonna complain to, eh?"" was what he said. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

I had a work vehicle with a sticker on it in my parking space (which I pay $100/month for) but despite that he didn't believe I had the right to park there and called in parking complaints four times, getting me over $100 in tickets, which caused friction with the company I worked at. His complaint was that I was parked in the wrong spot. I wasn't. None of the spots in the lot were numbered and he wouldn't tell me where I -could- park. In the mornings he would wait at my truck and yell at me. After I escalated this conflict the building repainted the parking spots and issued me a permit for the same numbered spot I'd been parked in. A few months later I came home from a weekend away to find someone else had parked in my spot. I had a highly recognizable vehicle which everybody passes on their way out of the parking lot. I parked in another spot nearby and the next morning came out to find my vehicle had been towed across the city which cost me half a day's work and $350.

It's a private 1 bedroom in a building. The superintendent has entered my unit without authorization or notice, changing smoke detector batteries and doing other things. I have a silent security system so this is how I know. A few weeks ago he tried to force his way in with threats, when I was home, because a neighbour's sink was clogged. I asked him for 24 hours notice and refused him entry and he returned handing me a slip of paper dated for the previous day, forging a document granting himself entry. I continued to refuse entry and he started yelling. Ultimately he went and snaked the sink from the neighbours side. He didn't need to enter my unit, as it turns out.

There are cockroaches, fleas and bedbugs in the building. There was feces smeared on the wall in the hall for 5 months and there's dog shit, from a very large dog in the back stairwell at least once a week.  The laundry machines never work, which is ironic because I'm pretty sure it's the Landlord's family which also owns the laundry business. Every few weeks someone gets evicted from the building. It's almost always a man in his 40s, who sits on the lawn outside with all of his possessions, looking bewildered, until the police (who the building calls) come and make him leave before throwing the possessions he can't carry in the garbage. 

The building's stairwell and lobby are used as temporary shelters by people who may or may not be former tenants and because of this delivery drivers will sometimes refuse to deliver for safety reasons. And it's not a low rent or community housing building. Also, the same man has yelled racist obscenities from his top floor window between 3AM and 6AM for the two years I've been here and management has done nothing, despite complaints from the whole street and multiple visits by police. 

It's a brutal place and we're being farmed for profit by uptown millionaires who are unashamed to declare that they hate poor people. This is Toronto at its worst.",2,2,1,1,1

Additionally, she is unresponsive to emails (once quoted, ""Emailing tenants is at my discretion"" and ""Emails are not protocol""--what century is she working in?), noise complaints, and incredibly unclear in her communication when providing directives to tenants. In addition to noise, she does not provide clarity on why garbage and recycling is scheduled for pick up at all hours of the day including early AM on weekends (as early as 6:30 AM). She's been informed the super wheels garbage out of the building at early hours in the morning, which has gone unchanged.

She would show up and want to look around when I was at work and told my children that I gave her permission. They would call me to confirm and the she would argue with me over the phone about just letting her in. 
Utilities were included in the lease and I received a notice to resident of the hydro being cut off for nonpayment. And when I called hydro to advise that I was a tenant in which my lease included utilities my landlord called me to tell me hydro made a mistake. The guy who lived below me told me that when he first moved in the hotwater had been shut off and it took a month to repair. 
When I first moved in I told her about 2 screens that were missing and the entire 2 years I lived there, she never repaired it. The ac broke twice, both times when i first turned it on for the season, I had to argue with her to repair it after she blamed me for breaking it. When the repair man came he told me that it has needed to be replaced for several years and she calls every year for a quick fix that he advises after the fix would stop working again. When I moved in the place was filthy and was not cleaned and she would not let me pay for someone to come in and clean before I moved in even after offering to pay per diem rent for the few days before so the cleaners could come in. The place was vacant.
Overall she was constantly argumentative, pushy, rude and insulting. I am in the legal field and I would constantly  advise her of my rights as a tenant and her responsibilities as a landlord and I can't be bullied. 
It is obvious that she bullies tenants and me standing up to her escalated her behaviour. She made living in that place a nightmare.

It often seems as if he procrastinates and gives little concern to the problems of his tenants as a passive-aggressive way of getting them to move out of their own accord, so that he can get new tenants in for a higher rental agreement.

It is a three-storey building with one small elevator which takes 3 minutes to travel from the basement to the third floor. We are also not allowed to use this elevator for moving. Understandable considering its size and type. Meant primarily for wheelchair access. Recently, the Lobby Intercom System was not operating. Deliveries were unable to contact individuals to tell them their delivery was there or, if they phoned, they had to go down to get the packages, heavy or not, by themselves. It was very inconvenient and took from April 5 to April 22 to be rectified. It took a month for someone to fix a broken dryer vent in my apartment. The landlord has just advised us to remove all belongings from the balcony if possible, so they can clean the windows. I can clean our windows easier and faster than it will take me to remove all belongings. There does not appear to be any compassion from this company.",1,2,3,4,3

1130,BOARDWALK PROPERTIES,LONDON,N6J1W1,"I rented from Boardwalk Properties a few years ago and it was the most horrible experience I ever went through. Whenever it rained my basement would leak and flood. Water would literally stream down the walls and I would have inches of water on the floor- I can’t count the number of times I had to call their head office in Alberta bc the property manager in my area would no longer take my calls. After MONTHS of calling and threatening legal action they repaired the exterior bricks (which only fixed part of the problem) and then MANY more months later they had a sump pump installed. I finally had enough of living there and bought my own house. 3 months after purchasing my house I found out that my old neighbor had a really bad case of bedbugs, which Boardwalk knew and didn’t tell anyone else, and I brought them with me to my new home. Bc I had no warning I wasn’t looking for bedbugs and by the time I realized I had them it cost me a fortune to exterminate. 
The new tenants to my old unit reached out to me and told me that they wished they never moved into that place bc the old pipes burst and ruined so much of their things. 
Also every time the maintenance guy would come over my cat would hiss and get upset- he never did this with anyone else in his 17yrs alive- I’m almost positive that guy hurt my cat when I wasn’t home. 
I could go on and on about how horrible they were but you get the idea.",1,2,3,3,3

While York did bring us space heaters and eventually offer us a rent reimbursement it didn’t make up for the logistics of living through a cold fall and early winter with no heat. The worst part was when we finally heard back from a York rep after many unanswered phone calls and messages they claimed quote “they didn’t know we were cold.” At the end of the day you’re always just going to be a number to a company like this, and even when they’re doing something illegal you have very little recourse. We still live here because we love the building and our neighbors, but this situation really showed us York’s true colours.

He really did affect my mental health because renting from this man has made me feel unsafe, unheard and my rights completely ripped apart by the Landlord and Tenant Board and the Ottawa Police Services. So much so I moved to the US to live closer to family. Canada and especially Ontario allows the rich to do whatever they want to the little people. Greg Shannon has abused his landlord status and every TENANT WILL GET HARASSED, UNFAIRLY SUED because he knows how to work the system as a slumlord, he will manipulate the LTB and law enforcement to get his own way and of course bogus judgment orders. He did tell me if moving day that he did sue his previous tenants, so this is a pattern: RENT, PAY RENT, MOVE OUT, GET SUED BY THE LTB!! Your safety and mental health will suffer because you are literally dealing with a dangerous slumlord....and when I mean dangerous, I mean you will feel so alone that even the Ottawa police services would sneer at you when you ask for help and protection. As a woman, I am worried female students or women will be mistreated by this man. I hope this post helps save some vulnerable people HELL from Greg Shannon.",1,1,1,1,1

They constantly allowed their children to play in the hallway that leads to our apartment with their  all at 7am when they have a whole backyard to play in. When I spoke to Loise about the noise nothing changed.
They told me laundry was once a week (I chose Sunday and they said they do theirs on Saturday but yet, they did laundry any day of the week and expected me to pay for the water being consumed. No repairs done prior to me moving in (the shower head literally fell off in my hand and no hot water at random times).
They told me I had to shovel the ""barely there"" snow that my windshield brushed off my car, yet I had to hop the curb every day just to get into my ""parking spot"", ruining my tires and cap. I had a slip and fall because they never cleared the walkway to my apartment or put salt, just their driveway (even though they said it wastheir job to do it). Unfortunately I could go on about more things but needless to say all they cared about was their mortgage being paid but lacked respect for me and my family and didn't care to do any home maintenance or encourage a peaceful living environment.

These people were confronted and shooed off. After this incident, XY called the lower unit tenant and told them that “under no circumstances are [they] supposed to ever speak to potential renters” and only backed down when the lower unit tenant threatened to file a police report.

1214,ANJANI DIAL-HOWIE,TORONTO,M6E 2E8,"You’re in for a wild ride with this property!

Before I begin listing off the problems with this room, here’s a little info about it.
It is a small and really narrow 2 story house with a basement(you share the house with the landlord btw), located in the heart of Little Jamaica in Toronto.

Now to the fun part. The rent for a single room here is 1000$ CAD a month which I wouldn’t mind if the landlord and the property would actually be of the quality expected for 1K a month. Starting off the list, there is no heating in the room during winter nor cooling during summer, I was freezing my ass in my room and to be outside was warmer than being inside, texting the landlord would not fix this issue; during summer the house would become a big hot sauna and changing temperature on the thermostat would be punished and turned back to normal because it is “too expensive.” Moving on, the internet quality is complete trash, I would even say that the internet doesn’t exist there, so if you’re a student, or a work-from-home worker, or just simply want to use Netflix or play on your console, then you simply can’t, because the internet doesn’t work. Continuing the topic of tech, there are often electricity outages on this property, because the landlord has too many dollar-store appliances connected everywhere that constantly put pressure on the electricity leading to shortages that happen regularly twice or thrice a month. Also the washing machine experience is just painful, because either the landlord or her boyfriend do not know where to put tide pods and instead of putting them in the drum the put it into the liquid detergent dispenser and simply clog up the washing machine causing it to stain your clothes with the leftover tide pod bits in the dispenser. Moving on, the landlord steals! Yep that’s right, they steal, i caught them once stealing my food from the fridge, I have also caught them using my detergent that I forgot to take back into my room, also worth mentioning that the fridge space is limited and you also don’t get any space in the freezer, on top of that the fridge space that “belongs” to you can be used by the landlord even though they told me(before I moved in) that the fridge space won’t be touched by them. Next, we have pest issues, I have witnessed countless amounts of cockroaches and since the landlord, once again, did not care , I had to invest into my own cockroach traps, ohh and also the landlord leaves their fruits and other food out for long periods of time so fruit flies are very common. Finishing up, the room quality… while the room itself is spacious the furniture there needs to be freshened up, the bed is broken in some places, there are also holes in the wall that were left from pictures hanging there. 
So yeah, it was my little complaint about this property and I want to save people their money, time, health, and nerves(I myself moved out on the brink of a breakdown) so I strongly suggest you to avoid this landlord and their house at any cost, because there are many other rooms that are better than this and cost less!!!!


P.S. 
Worth mentioning that during hot weather, the landlord has a really bright idea to open every window and door inside their house and leave it open during all night, so theres a high risk of someone breaking into the house and there’s also a high risk to your own safety!!!!!!!",1,2,3,3,1

They still claim that I never put in a work order( even though i have literally keept documentation of all the conversations/emails regarding it) talk about gaslighting!! 
It took me six years just to get the mould in my bathroom fixed( which was part of the lease agreement when I moved in)- they did a horrendous job! Gaps between the shower/wall and door frame/wall, and only painted the patchwork they did for the mould! and even then it took 5 week for maintenance to come back and do it properly… unbelievable. 
  I never had a working buzzard when I moved in, they had three maintenance workers and the Tenant & Community Relations Specialist come to see for her self, I was as told “ WRH will never pay to fix it, as they would have to replace the whole building”.  I was left speechless! 
Fast forward to 2020 and Covid, I was sick and awaiting test results. Since I had no working buzzard, and the Key Holder refused any home aid/pharmacists entrance so that I could get medical help, i had to break quarantine, not knowing if I had Covid or not ( mind you alot of elderly people live here).

He was caught by the LTB for CHANGING the date of my rent cheque and cashing it 2 weeks early and then issuing an eviction notice when it (obviously) bounced. I have this all documented from tribunal. The house had mice, most of our furniture was destroyed. They chewed up the bottom of my sofa and dedicated all inside it.

1254,NJS CAPITAL,TORONTO,M6K 2C9,"I am a tenant as of 2018 and can confirm the landlords, NJS Capital, are demons. I've lived here since 2010 and NJS only took control of the building in 2018. Needless to say, it has turned my peaceful home completely upside down.

We have an active T2 claim against them with the LTB after they put us through 6 months straight of daily renovation construction noise during the first lockdown of the pandemic when we couldn't leave the house. That's when they were busy doing shoddy renovations of the units they had evicted using confusing zoning rules they use and abuse at their leisure. Now we have had no choice but to file a second one because they rented out the basement unit directly below our unit for $5000/month to a bunch of idiots running a music recording studio that uses their unit like a party space day and night. 

There is very little soundproofing to speak of int building. This is a former textile factory converted into live-work units and has never been properly soundproofed for occupancy. The only thing separating units is a thin layer of hard wood. I can hear people cough, burp, fart, cry, fuck, even sing in their shower. If I spilled a glass of water, the entire content will flow through the ceiling into the music studio below us. Before NJS owned this building, the previous landlord was an elderly man who charged below market rate BC of the substandard soundproofing and warned every new tenant about the lack of soundproofing in their lease agreements. We also had a superintendent who lived on site to help mediate noise complaints and for the first 8 years I lived here it was an amazing place to live and I absolutely loved my unit in spite of the lack of soundproofing.

Obviously NJS is not telling any of the new tenants about the lack of soundproofing. New tenant pay nearly 3X what the old tenants pay (who all have rent control). As a result, NJS has resorted to seedy, unethical methods such as weaponized noise pollutoon to get older tenants with rent control to move out so they can start a new lease and charge higher rent. When they first took over the building, they removed the common area laundry & dryer for months, saying they ""needed repairs"", only for the machines to come back later 2x more expensive than before. They are lying scumbags and are actively turning affordable rental buildings in low income neighbourhoods throughout the city in Parkdale, Regent Park, East York, and Scarborough into overpriced slums. They are also developing condos — they bought the former Guardian pharmacy at Queen and Lansdowne. New tenants in our building's newly renovated units report long lists of repairs needed, cosmetic and structural problems, and property management that never reply to emails.

Well we moved to a house in the same school zone (for $2600 for a 4 bedroom) and found out there was a family living in the house because one of the new family's kids was in my kid's class. Their daughter didn't have school aged kids yet. She never intended on moving in. They just wanted more rent so they thought it was an easy way to get us out without argument.

They have put in an application to increase rents above the guidelines and they can't even keep the building clean and maintained.  For example, major water damage that is seeping through the concrete foundation near garage main entrance to building has been ignored.  It has caused a Niagara Falls situation and tenants have to be hopping, skipping and jumping  over the pond that has formed on the ground.  This issue has totally been ignored.  Garbage is always scattered on property especially near the door entrances.  Carpet vacuuming has ceased since December 2022 because they do not want to invest into a new vacuum to clean carpets.

1259,DEVONSHIRE PROPERTIES,MISSISSAUGA,L5J 4M9,"Overall I believe the landlord overseeing the apartments at 1201 Walden Circle does a very good job. The only concerns I would have are that repairs that are performed for the units tend to be quick fixes rather than solutions, so upkeep of the unit over the years can be questionable. For example, we had a counter with no framing or support underneath due to previous damage and it sunk down enough to prevent the cabinets from opening. When they arrived to make the repair they were ready to simply cut or remove the cabinet doors rather than support the counter itself. Thankfully I informed them of what I thought was needed to fix the problem and they actually listened and were able to add some framing. We also put in a few orders for pest control due to ants and it was dealt with quickly, however, we did have to get multiple treatments done on separate occasions for a suite higher than the 15th floor. My other concern stems from the fire alarms and elevators. The fire alarms go off frequently so I know they work, but I believe they need to be changed because they emit a high pitched noise that I know my partner and those with decreased hearing abilities do not notice or wake up to in the middle of the night. Additionally, one of the two elevators is frequently shut down for maintenance/repair, and yet it still lurches from time to time which is absolutely terrifying. Otherwise there is always someone in the office during open hours that is ready to help and the staff are very friendly. Tenants receive any notices for interruptions and advanced notice is given for any lease changes.",4,4,5,5,5

1282,KAMRAN TAJADOD,RICHMOND HILL,L4C9M5,"Disappointing Experience with Kamran Tajadod, Iranian Realtor in Richmond Hill, Ontario

I had the misfortune of renting a property managed by Kamran Tajadod, an Iranian realtor based in Richmond Hill, Ontario. While I was initially excited about finding a place to call home, my experience with Kamran quickly soured due to his blatant disregard for the law and a lack of professionalism.

Firstly, Kamran attempted to force our family to vacate the property without any legal grounds. He seemed to be well aware of the laws that protect tenants, but chose to ignore them in favor of his own interests. His primary reason for trying to get me to leave was to illegally increase the rent for the next tenant, which goes against Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.

To add insult to injury, Kamran threatened that if I didn't move out, a family member of his would move in – a clear intimidation tactic meant to make us feel insecure in my own home. This level of unprofessionalism was shocking and left us feeling uneasy throughout my tenancy.

Furthermore, Kamran showed a blatant disregard for the maintenance of the property. When a part of the ceiling became damaged, he refused to repair it, claiming that it was too expensive. This negligence not only caused discomfort but also posed a potential safety hazard for me and other tenants.

In addition to the lack of repairs, Kamran never took any responsibility for the upkeep of the outdoor areas, including lawn care and snow removal. This negligence led to an unkempt appearance and posed additional safety concerns during the winter months.

Overall, my experience with Kamran Tajadod as a landlord was incredibly disappointing. His disregard for the law, unprofessional behavior, and refusal to maintain the property made for a stressful and unpleasant living situation. I would strongly advise prospective tenants to avoid renting from Kamran in the future.",1,1,1,3,2

1295,ANONYMOUS,MISSISSAUGA,L5K 1C1,"Leave landlord name blank for privacy concerns. However it is the worst rental house you can ever imagine! My bf and I live with landlord on second floor of a house, and there are two more in the basement - before we sign the contract, landlord lied to us saying basement is empty. No more than a month we moved in, police came once because we were reported as rooming house. But that is just the beginning of the nightmare. Landlord refuse to turn up AC in the winter, so room temperature is always below 70. She warned us several times for eating upstairs instead of in the kitchen - but she is always cooking there so we really need privacy! The worst part is that, we signed a fixed term contract for a year which allows us to renew it after one year. However, she refused to continue the lease, by complaining that her stuff was stolen by tenants. Her son begged us not to go to police, so we just moved out quickly with some really bad memories. If you are looking for a house in this area, take extra care!!",3,2,1,1,1
1296,JUDY BOODRAM 41-10 RODDA BOULEVARD,SCARBOROUGH,M1E 2Z6,"NOTE: This review is for house 41 at 10 Rodda blvd. My experience IMO is a great example as to why we need landlords to be licenced and rentals regulated. At first there weren't a lot of red flags, however the female landlord tried to trick me into giving her my SIN# ""in case of an emergency"". Do not ever give anyone your SIN. Next, take the name I've given with a grain of salt, because I'm pretty sure it's a fake name. They never gave receipts, rent was paid in cash. The landlord was not declaring the extra income they were taking, which is illegal, as was renting this house. With a full house, the landlord was making $2500.00 a month. The landlord was renting a basement apartment and two rooms upstairs, and I was in one room for almost a year. This house is not meant for sublets. In case of fire, there was only one exit out of the house that was accessible. The kitchen was on the main floor, and only one bathroom upstairs. The rooms had a bed with three drawers, a dresser, a mini fridge for food, a chair and a t.v connected to cable everyone was allowed to access. The landlord had cameras all over the house, used to spy on us. She accused one tenant of cooking for someone else and threaten to charge extra for gas or throw the tenant out. She accused another of bringing too many groceries home. She regualrly broke into the rooms and searched them, and when she saw something she didn't like, she would send paragraph long text messages, or stick post-it notes in the kitchen and washroom. If she felt you had too much stuff, she would threaten to throw you out if you didn't store it somewhere else. From my understanding, no one had a lot stuff, as these were small rooms. The post it would say things like, take a 15 minute shower only. Don't let things accidentally drop in the toilet. Only cook food that you yourself would/can consume. Very petty notes. She was renting to adults, but acted like a headmistress in a boarding school. Tenents were not allowed to have guests sleep over, or visitors without getting her permission. She claimed years back it was because she had a young son. Not sure what the excuse is now. Pets were not allowed, and later on plants beause she claimed it would create some sort of bug that stung really hard, just weird. The scariest part of the house was it was maintained by friends of the landlord. Wardrobes were taken away and replaced with four planks of wood and a pole to hang your clothing. This was drilled right into the floors. All the eletricity was done by another friend. In one room, two of the outlets burnt out, one was located right behind the bed the tenant would sleep in. 
The Landlord also rented to very scary people. One tenant was seen on camera dragging out the body of their friend that had OD'd in the basement apartment. Turns out the friend was ok, and the tenant was kicked out. Another tenant hadn't moved in, but was having their welfare cheques sent to the house. They were fresh out of jail with new tear drop tattoos on their face. It feels like this landlord was renting to vulnerable people, people who she could manipulate or kick out easily with minium damage to her. I noticed people who were legit and stronger she'd coniviced or hassled to force them to leave as soon as possible. Basically my experience was bizzare, annoying, and at some points dangerous, and it wasn't cheap, and she should have issued receipts. IMO the city needs to pay this house a visit and note all the red flags and shut her rentals down. The Federal govenment needs to get involved and charge her all the taxes she owes. 
I do not recommend this rental to anyone. It's absolutly illegal. You will not be able to prove you live there or get your money back if something goes wrong. This person is scamming people, and is taking advantage of the rental situation and it's wrong. I'm posting this review to warn people, but also to hopefully get some justice for all the tenants, myself included that were ripped off and harrassed by this woman. Ideally, I hope one day she is never able to rent to anyone again. If it was up to me that would be the reality now.",1,2,1,1,1

1298,FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC.,TORONTO,M4B 2T5,"My review is on the Forest Hill East York location

George is an ok guy. He can sometimes be good & easy to talk to but other times especially when it has to do with other tenant issues & management he can be shady. He has the right intentions but maybe doesn’t want to deal so much with tenant problems. 

For example, if you’re having a dispute with another tenant he doesn’t do much at all unless you keep nagging him about it and have other neighbours who are having the same issues to back you up. And don’t even get me started with Ally. 

She can be a pain in the ass to talk to. She is quick to dismiss your issues and immediately tells you to talk to George or “send an email” rather than actually listening to you and making you feel welcomed living there. I know she is just the front desk person but don’t just make people feel like their problems don’t matter. 

Other issues besides management. Not sure if it’s just this property or a lot of Forest Hills residences but there is a huge problem with roaches. Landlord approves anyone at this point. Also their laundry rooms are horrid! So dirty and dark. Half the time the machines don’t work and take your money. Oh and did I forget you can hear everything everyone is doing in their units throughout all hours of the day? Really just a horrible place to live. Would not recommend.",1,1,3,4,3

Nothing was ever repaired, they consistently sent out notices to enter the apartment but did not give 24 hours, only one or two. Laundry always broken, security doors never shut, garbage everywhere. Their property manager ended up stealing my rent so they took me to court with their fancy Toronto lawyers for non payment of rent. I had all my receipts and they were so unorganized (not even sure what month they were accusing me of non payment) so the case got thrown out. Gave my notice and left after that stress.

Once I stayed up all night to continue to bail out the sewage that was backing up into my back tub so it didn’t flood my apartment. I was constantly straining to hear any sounds of water or dripping so no backup went unnoticed. I set up a camera so I could monitor the area when I wasn’t home. It was the most stressful time in my life.

In the end, he used the disrepair of the house due to longterm neglect to evict all three tenants for repairs and renovations, saying “you know, this place hasn’t really been maintained for 40 years.” As if it wasn’t his responsibility.

I was threatened with eviction a year before the final eviction, but when I got a paralegal they withdrew the first filing. In the end, his lawyer daughter negotiated with us, 6 people who had lived a cumulative 27 years in the building, less than $5000 each to move at the height of the pandemic.

They then spent what is probably $500K to gut and reno all four units and re-rented them for triple what we were paying.

I rented the Basement, throughout the years, it seemed like for 2 of the 5ish years they'd be doing renovations upstairs which started early in the morning and messed with my sleep, it was really loud and often shook the whole place. 
There were no bedbugs or roaches, the place was pretty nice (there was centipedes and Silverfish bugs but I didn't mind them too much). They respected my privacy but did have a cleaning person come in once randomly and wake me up thinking they were going to clean the basement too (no one told them there's a Tenant?) 

Wiring for some things were questionable, the fan above the stove worked intermittently and we had a light fixture or something randomly start a fire in the middle of the night due to faulty wiring, fire dept had to come!
Promised some repairs / fixes I never got, I'd have to bug em for anything to really get done. Oh and the entry way was always leaking water when it rained, had to scoop out dirty water to prevent the place from flooding a bunch of times! 

After about 5-6 years of staying there, also during the Covid Pandemic when it was pretty bad, they said they wanted me out to 'renovate' the basement apt. They said I could come back but I'd have to pay more rent.  They never gave me any proper notification in writing, but did email me and mention they'd give me a months rent back If I left in 2 weeks as they were planning on starting their renovations. I think it was even before that they started renovating, so that wasn't a lie, they were literally tearing through the ceiling and pieces were falling down on me and my friends as we were moving my stuff out, and I never got that months rent back as promised. He claimed the Fridge or Stove was disgusting and had to throw it away... which we actually cleaned so that was NOT the case.

1314,INFINITY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - LEE CORBIN,TORONTO,M5N 1A2,"This review is specific to the rental building at 122 Fifth Street in Etobicoke ON managed by Lee Corbin of Infinity Property Management. This is a small building with approx. 12 units rented by several long-term tenants, and some newer tenants.  
With all the nightmare stories out there of horrible landlords, I feel like we are very lucky to have an owner and property manager who are helpful, respectful and take care of this building and are respectful to the tenants.  
The building was purchased by a new owner about 3 years ago and they hired Infinity to manage the property.  I was worried that we'd lose personal access to a building manager with a ""property management company"" being involved  (our previous property manager was a private individual vs. a company and he was fantastic). But, I needn't have worried. Lee Corbin from Infinity was assigned as the new manager for our building and he is personable, makes his direct contact info available to residents, he'll respond to texts very quickly and responds to issues/inquiries right away. 

Also, the building owners ensure that the building is maintained well, and follow LTB rules with respect to rental rates. I've never seen them or Lee the property manager be unfair. 
I'm sure this site will have plenty of poor reviews, but I thought I'd emphasize that there are great landlords and property managers out there too.",4,5,5,5,5

She's SO bad, she's got THREE (3) names/aliases! This review is for 171 St. Clair Ave. E. in Toronto, Ontario, however she also owns 500 Dawes Road which is an even WORSE property! BOTH have the same Superintendent Dan Anderson, a 60-something, alcoholic, potentially retarded, misogynistic, obese and abusive waste of human excrement. He and his constant companion Courtney, make up Dumb and Dumber in managing this property. For years, interior corridors has had peeling paint, bicycle wheel tracks on the walls and uneven leveled stairs at the back entrance which MANY people have tripped on as they were NOT properly torn down and replaced but ""patched"". Patch, should be the nickname for this property, incidentally ""the jewel"" in this old lady's crown. She owns the place and is in her 80's (evil never dies!!), and has her middle aged son come and pick up the rent checks. If you want to enter from the front, you'll need to climb over the jumble of filth that is the humanity the Superintendent ""socializes"" with, including any sexist jeers that come free with the price of passage that is almost always blocked! The place is so hot (furnace has been broken for years!), everyone routinely walks around in shorts and tank tops in the middle of January (unless you're ""lucky"" enough to live on the same floor as the drunken Super...and endure his staggering and mumbling as he makes his way down the hall in the late evening hours after chugging his body weight in Heineken!!). Complain about anyone in the building and they'll just pay for his silence in beer. Meanwhile, you live in a near constant racket as the building is so old you can hear EVERYTHING and I mean....everything. I should NOT know my neighbour's ""safe word""!! The Super will go ""investigate"" the offending noise and then go and join in the merriment, point and laugh at you, while you pull your hair out seeking a modicum of calm. It's a vile, disgusting boys club. Don't bother trying to call, visit or serve the Slumlady. She doesn't answer calls (it constantly goes to messaging), and her address up in Richmond Hill is to a Plaza with a PO Box. I'm sure she's made it her life's work to avoid being served legal papers! She is SHAMELESS in her attempts to money grub -- yes, I think she DOES plan to take it with her! She routinely tried to implement illegal rent increases INCLUDING (get this!!), trying to get those increases to apply RETROACTIVELY - before she EVER served the papers. The Super just lies and says he served them. No man, you were OVER-SERVED that night! NO notices went out and what do the people that live there do? THEY PAY THE ILLEGAL INCREASES. Why? Because they CANNOT find anything cheaper or more centrally located in the city than The Inglewood. I've spoken to some who don't dare complain for fear all the complaints make the Slumlady sell the property. Her idiot son will be set for life. I think that's the plan. Just run it into the ground! There are also a lot of nice Filipino residents here who don't necessarily know the LTB laws and again, are too intimidated to stand up to Dan the bully, and they can't find anything cheaper/better. I honestly think 171 St. Clair is where hope goes to DIE. Do NOT rent here. The place is full of backwards-thinking people; the pack rat on the 2nd floor, the 3 guys who drink and drug themselves to the point of near death in the 3rd floor unit in the elbow of the building... The only people I can recommend to live here would be young, single bachelors who don't care about sleep, safety or filth or those that simply cannot find anything better.

The common areas are kept clean by a superintendent who communicates if there are any issues and always responds to concerns.

It is a revolving door when it comes to keeping maintenance staff, been down to one again since January. Security is so bad that anyone can enter and leave the building any time they want. Water leaks were so bad that tenants were getting sick from the mold, Morguard answer was to contact your insurance company and have them pay for a motel room for 3-4 months and put your furniture in storage, one tenant did that and moved back in, two weeks later it was back to leaking. The list is to long for this review, tenants have been recording their stories and plenty of pictures to backup everything, The Property Manager is rude, refuses to do anything and becomes very confrontational when you complain, it is her way of not having to deal with it, you get warning letters that you will be evicted for not paying rent, even when you show your bank statement that the check was cash by the landlord, you are expected to go to the bank and pay for a copy of the check. How hard is it to assign payment as paid when the unit number is on the check?

1359,SAICKLEY PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,K2P 0A9,"Saickley was very hands-off with our unit, which contributed to privacy - they weren't hovering around like I've had with other landlords, but they didn't come in for anything. We inherited the unit from other tenants who passed along the lease from other tenants, all of whom spent multiple years in the same unit, which made the rent very cheap at the time. They would cross out some names and put the new ones above it, so when we got a new roommate, there were over 12 crossed out names on the lease.
That was decent, but it was very telling that the landlord was just making money off of us with absolutely no work, besides owning the place.
When we did need repairs due to the older unit becoming decrepit from regular wear and tear, they became hostile and much more involved in our lives. The front doors' hinges and keylocks were rusting off and breaking, making our unit incredibly insecure, to which the landlord accused us of ""partying"" that lead to the hinges and locks being broken. When we actually did a walk-around the unit, our personal items were commented on and ridiculed. It wasn't until we made legal threats that they did the bare minimum of repairs.
Finally, when we moved out, they charged us extra and illegal fees. They charged us a cleaning fee despite not providing a walk around of the unit, an additional month of rent on top of the 60 days notice we provided, and removal of appliances which was their responsibility. While these were disputable and illegal claims, they never took any of us to claims courts for these and could be ignored - it was definitely an attempt to get some extra cash off of us before they did the necessary massive repairs or renovations for a new lease of tenants.",1,1,2,3,1

The one bedroom was a bright blue colour & we wanted to paint it, so we all agreed on a colour! We moved in a month before the COVID lockdown, and during so they checked in on us and asked us if we needed anything. They treated us like family. We later got the opportunity to rent a full house rather than a smaller condo, and they were more than willing to work with us to an agreement on ending our lease early.

1363,CHESOO (CHANEL) JUNG AND JUSTIN,ETOBICOKE,M8W 1L4,"Worst experience renting in Toronto I've ever had. They kept revising the rental agreement well into a month into my time in their basement apartment so I didn't entirely know what I was getting into. They offered no privacy. We started off sharing laundry machines. They would come down into my apartment with only 15 minutes notice every other day ""for laundry"".  They would also come into the apartment with no notice when I was not home to ""do repairs"".  It was completely un-liveable.   They were just constantly in the apartment. There were many problems with the house, including heating. The heating was not properly functioning and I had to go without heat in the fall and winter for quite awhile. They supplied space heaters but not right away. I froze.  They had two giant rottweilers that suffered from separation anxiety. Whenever the owners would leave in the morning the dogs would bark and cry for at least an hour every single day. There was no sound proofing or sound insulation so I had to hear this as a start to every morning in the house. The relationship with them soured and they began to bully me mis-using various landlord notices to intimidate me. They bought a separate washing machine as noted by the maid but were still invading my privacy to wash the dog's things every few days with the machines I used for my clothes. When I told them I wanted to move out quite early they wouldn't return my deposit for last month's rent even though I wasn't going to stay there more than a few days into the month. They also made move out difficult refusing to open the side door to allow me to maneuvre my furniture out the cramped side entrance of the house.  Horrible experience. I lost money. They profited. My entire time there was torture.  They even called the cops on me and my father when my dad put himself between me and the rottweilers when Justin was trying to bully me.  Truth be told I think the wife was jealous or concerned and that's why she was trying to exert so much control over me by invading my privacy all the time. Otherwise I can't imagine why things would start off so negatively and then just get progressively worse to such a level of toxicity.

She knew we had a cat and allowed it despite the no door for us. Eventually, she said that our family member had ""over stayed"" despite him being on the lease and paying rent? Also told us to keep our cat downstairs, which is impossible considering we have no door. So I put my beds headboard at the stairway. She gave her boyfriend the code to the front door, and in the middle of the night i was home alone, and i heard the door code being entered and opened. Then boots being taken off. I was in the middle of doing laundry, so i eventually had to go upstairs to switch it over. Only when i went to do so, my clothes had been tossed to the side so he could do his. She had come downstairs early in the morning to get someone to come look at the furnace, but had not told us before hand so we were unaware they were coming. My fiance worked shift work so he had quite literally just gotten to bed. He yelled towards the stairs ""where's the notice"", and she yelled back ""what notice"". Our family member decided to move out due to her constant harassing of him being there. She's a flight attendant for the military and lived in Kingston, so she was only in town during layovers.

Work orders have always been dealt with promptly, with proper notice given and respected for unit entry. The building has a debit machine in the office to pay rent with if you like, and they will also take interac transfers which I appreciate, I think it shows that they want to take our convenience into consideration. At one point a resident's family was expanding and building management offered them first dibs on a larger apartment so they'd have more room for the baby without having to move, which was very sweet to see because they could have just posted it at market but they gave it to them instead!

Do you like black mold? How about fridges without shelves, or appliances so old they die? Or, for the truly brave, how about living above someone who has a locked door while you have absolutely nothing, not even a baby gate?
She was caught on camera sneaking into the rental living space around midnight on more than one occasion. Under the kitchen sink is full of black mold that she refuses to remove because then she'd have to replace the countertop. The washing machine died because it was over 20 years old and she did not replace for two weeks. Between September and December 2022, she harassed the previous tenants over a drip she claimed to hear even after at least 4 plumbing or other contractors told her there's nothing wrong. She accused her previous tenants of lifting heavy weights on the top floor and somehow damaging the room, even when the tenants had nothing of the sort and weren't even home at the time she accused them of lifting weights. She planted sound recording devices in the common area and the garage (which was supposed to be just for the tenants). The by-law office was called when she cut the power to the central heating and let the temps fall to 16 degrees in November. After she got in trouble for that, she had a technician move the thermostat to the basement (which is her private residence with a locked door). She has no problem shoving her personal life on tenants, including blaming her ill health on your cooking, having you intervene in her fights with religious institutions, rambling paranoia about the Chinese government, and telling tenants the neighbours are mad at them even if it isn't true.

He barged into our apartment to check a water meter in our bathroom without any consent. He blocked me in the driveway so I couldn’t get to a job interview. He also would yell at my boyfriend and I on multiple occasions. He snipped our camera line. He would bring the ex landlord that sexually harassed me onto the property after knowing this and claims he wasn’t told. He also did nothing about the fire alarm that wasn’t working. He  made creepy sexual comments about a woman I knew. He also did not have common courtesy to let us know that people would be measuring the broken door in our house.

I spent a month repainting, refinishing the hardwood floors, replaced all the trim and had an electrician fix and replace the faulty (arcing in some cases) electrical outlets and switches.  

They never came to inspect the interior of the property for several years, including failing to inspect the fire alarms or co detectors.  

Eventually one of them came to check the detectors and was blown away at the quality of the home.  Said that the difference was remarkable!

That’s when the bogus and harassing LTB claims started coming in.  They also screamed at me in my front yard on a unannounced visit and accused me of “stealing electricity” because I plugged in a diesel truck for an hour on an extremely cold day. (No where in the rental agreement did it mention anything about how I could use electricity with the exception of window mounted AC units) 

I fought and won several times at the LTB because I had done nothing wrong.  Eventually, one Tribunal ruled against me not based on the facts of the case but the fact that I had been in front of the LTB so many times in quick succession…

Months and months go by with no repairs completed or even started. The only weathertight door to our apartment had a large hole in it that the previous tenant placed there to make it easier to serve her clientele.  Needless to say in Northern Ontario a big hole in your front door let's alot of freezing air in and alot of paid heat out.  Temporary fix was a wee bit of insulation and a cold air return vent you would see indoor for a heating system, on each side of the hole. When the warmer weather came request was submitted to replace the door. (Bylaw in our city stated this is a required item and is owners responsibility).  Response was he would get someone to install a door but we were responsible for purchasing it. - uh no. Many of the items that were noted in the tasks to do were actually bylaw infractions.  If i was smart i should have revealed to our city bylaw enforcement. Once i signed the eviction i was not able to submit the infractions as it would be taken as retaliatory. This inability for me to file complaint save hundreds of thousands of $ for him. 
Lets just say the list of violations was lengthy. Communication-he his a downright bully. Has no problem talking down to you and mentioning he knows more as he had worked years in real estate.  It got to a point that i was required to attatch and highlight our provincial landlord and tenant act to any email i sent as he my ideas were simply pulled out of thin air.  No action and never appology when i was correct. Finally after numerous threats of eviction with no validity he came up with an eviction to move a family member into the unit.  That was his only legal route.  At this point I had enough and agreed. Needless to say with little housing we became homeless 4 months all possessions in storage and had only the bare necessities to hold our family together.

When they first bought the building they were entering units without permission for ""insurance"" reasons until a tenant told them that they weren't allowed to do that. They have applied to have the building demolished to build a new one to get around rent control regulations. Since they applied, they have stopped caring for the building. Cleaning in the common areas is done on a wildly inconsistent basis (it seems to be done when they have  showings for available apartments). There is regularly trash strewn about on the lawn and the green space in the back is not maintained. They take days to shovel snow, if they do it at all. When they do it, it's just a narrow path, not the whole sidewalk. When people move out, they renovate the apartment and charge 2-3 times as much but the renovations are done poorly, with new appliances that are laughably small and break easily. They shut the water off multiple times a month with 1 or 2 days notice and keep the temperature remarkably high in the winter (tenants do not control heat).

Bedford does a once over pretting up the Properties they buy by glueing cheap vynal flooring, a coat of paint, and ""new"" appliances.  
Their maintenance is sub par to say the least as they have no care for the tenants, expect high rent for Cookie Cut Properties, long wait times for necessary repairs, and if that door doesn't shut properly its okay we wont fix it anyways. 
Amenities included are
 basement apartments- nightly floor sweats *so dont keep anything that might get wet there*, bugs, no soundproofing for that upstairs neighbor, extra fees for parking *60$ keys*25$ unknowingly sharing your neighbors hydro bill and more! 
Second floor and up- experience state of the art sinking balconies. That curve is no structural damage they were just updated in the 90s! Don't worry about the glue seeping through the floor boards, or that any appliance isn't properly mounted to counters just enjoy that they look nice! 
Every apartment has new and improved water savers that will give you a dripping shower worse than a gutter spout in the rain! 
We assure you this was done as fast as possible with all the corners cut! -literally idk where he tossed those things... 
Parking- when it snows we do 1 straight line down the center of the lot and expect you to care for your spot, but since your paying for it understand only cars go into it, no motorcycles, ebikes, big trucks, etc.
Theres no cameras so that we can keep the cost of parking low, after all we did just paint it.

Major pest problem went on for five years and was never solved.  I literally thought about suicide weekly and my physical health took a huge nosedive which I have never recovered from.

311 never did anything.  I believed he paid off the swarmy city inspectors who would visit and literally look at me like I was the cockroach.  Vile corrupt careerists.

He bullied me into a lease weeks before I wanted it, but I blame myself for not walking away at that point.  I let him take advantage of my desperation not to be homeless.

He would slap illegal eviction notices on people's doors just to enjoy the look of terror on tenant's faces.  He did it knowing full well the LTB would toss these notices out.  He enjoys inflicting misery.

He underpays his staff and overworks them.  If they dare to complain he fires them without even trying to negotiate for ten seconds.  He's a shark who can't pass by a coin lying on the street.  He lives in a mansion worth $10 plus million but he will take you to LTB court for $43.

Would not consider any of these properties safe for women as superintendents tend to be misogynistic bullies Staff turnover including property management like you change your underwear:  frequently.   The only way to get things done when it comes to building standards is to call by-law to issue a mandate.

The illegal basement apartment was completely full of black mold after some time with no idea why or how it started. The family members living down there had to move upstairs with us. The deck was also literally falling apart due to the fact that they didn't treat the wood when they built it so the weather changes over time caused it to decay.

Plus the patio door was stuck shut with what I think was icotine when I moved in. It also usually smells of mold and mildew in the halls.

Would regularly show up unannounced or late at night and when we would not allow him in due to it being past the legal hours of entry he would text/email us after calling us immature and rude. Very misogynistic and rude in most encounters. On top of that, the house was in disrepair with significant issues such as mold, broken windows, and a barely functioning stove.

Administratively, they are pretty weak. They have one person managing the leases for 24 properties. Her response time can be anywhere from 2 months to a full year. Adding people to a lease, reconciling rent issues, transferring leases are all excruciatingly long processes.

1522,MUHAMMAD F KHAN,BRAMPTON,L7A4N2,"Khan Muhammad Furruck is a landlord from HELL! 

 Everything is a 1 but if I could say zero and have his license revoked as a ranking I would. 1. He illegally came into the home and put a lock box onto the thermostat.
2. Mice!!!!! Mice mice and did I say mice! He refused to hire the terminator to get rid of these pests. There were large holes underneath the footsteps, getting through the garage, and the backyard
3. There was a horrible leak in the roof. He only started to do something about it after there was a compliance letter from the Brampton town. 
4. FIRE SPARKED! Underneath the sink we have sparks and smoke flying because it was a circuit away from starting a fire. The fire department had to come. This landlord left a live wire exposed underneath the sink where a dishwasher used to be. He then tried to accuse us of putting a dishwasher there and then blamed our cats chewing on it. They would’ve been fried and dead. 
5. He would unlock the door and come into the house with an improper notice. (Sent a 3 am notice)
6. Would bring his dog without a leash or muzzle which is illegal in Ontario because his dog is a pit bull and around knowing we had small children.
7. Turned off the hot water and has turned off the electricity on us
8. The washer and dryer broke the first year and he never replaced it
9. We cleaned the backyard cause he refused to do it. 
10. Tried these long notices from 12 to 9 and then try to linger for as long as he can
11. End of the year contract instead month to month he threatened for a new contract for in crease from 2900 to 3600$ and another first and last months rent. Then harassed until we went to court and he lost both L1 & L2.
12. Brings strange people around the house. A worker went into the backyard and tried to break the window to the basement because I refused him inside the house. He thought I was a women home alone and tried to scare me. Husband was home.
13. Would go into our closets and cupboards and tried to take pictures of our belongings
14. He parked his car in the garage and he does not live at the house. Lied to the basement people telling them it is our car. 
15 1 am in the morning I caught him in the window with his phone and flash looking side my home. Several times he would stare at me from the outside looking inside.
16. Uses his body to push through his way through the door.
17. He does 24 hour notices EVERY SINGLE DAY
- Had to get a cease and desist
- Had to get a lawyer
- He purposely makes it difficult to live in the house 
- His one intention is to kick people out once every year so he can raise the rent to the market value. Plus greedy wanting more on top of it.
He tried to use dependants under the age of 16 as his reason to kick us out

Wanted to restrict any visitors to the house and would tell us he has friends around here to watch his tenants

He does not care about safety health
Invasive and very scary behaviour. I do not recommend ANYONE ESPECIALLY A SINGLE MOTHER THERE.

Basement is an illegal unit that he is renting out to people. It is a fire hazard in the basement. Fire department also clarified it

For 3 years the house did not have a proper fire alarm either for the whole house.
Will not give you your receipts at the end of the year either

So while at church they help the homeless, in reality their goal is to make people homeless for their own personal gain.

 They are the definition of slumlords who threaten their tenants because they believe they are smarter and can trick them into agreeing to illegal notices.  No consideration for people's time, proper notice of entry, or any form of personal respect.  

He is an ex addict with an anger management problem who threatens women and uses his new ""faith in God"" to pretend he has changed and turned into a decent person.  We moved out because I did not feel safe being home alone with my young child with the landlord on the property.

Notably when I moved in the apartment had not been given any care after the previous tenant left meaning there were many dents and chips out of the paint and drywall from millimeter ones up to about 6cm across. Often maintenance is done as a quick ""patch job"" as opposed to properly repairing things (eg calking tiles back together instead of fixing grout).

There have been a few incidents of maintenance requests taking far longer than they should considering the risk involved (ice left on steps for 4 days and having to advocate strongly for specific maintenance during COVID - the latter might have been a failure of management to understand the risk/benefit and their obligations to avoid non-essential work in units).

People consistently smoke at the entrances, on balconies, and in apartments despite the buildings being called ""smoke free."" Landlord's efforts to dissuade this have been marginally successful. Laundry is not available in all buildings, is expensive, and not particularly user friendly (one small washer and dryer together meaning multiple trips).",1,3,5,5,5

The contractor was still working on renovating the bathroom and said it would be finished prior to us moving in, almost 2 months goes by before we moved in and upon move in date the washroom wasn't even usable, there was mold all over the ceiling and stuff left from the contractor all over the floor, nothing was touched, the entire back half of the house from the day we had went for the viewing. We called the office to get some sort of an answer as to what that was about and nothing took them 3 days to get back to us and said the contractor was needed at other properties,  we explained that the washroom wasn't even usable and that there wasn't even a washer and dryer like they said, they told us to use downstairs facilities till the contractor had time to finish, now a month goes by nothing from either and then one day after work I come home to the door to down stairs screwed shut which was where our only washroom was at the time, the door knob to the garage busted off and no notice of anything, turns out the property manager came over and didn't have keys to come in didn't give notice but felt it was okay to come in and damage the property, my partner tried to call the property manager no answer then we received a text that he admitted to coming in.

1569,KAP PROPERTIES,SUDBURY,P3C 2E8,"Kayla with Kap Properties was the worst landlord/property manager I've ever experienced. We never missed a single rent payment, never asked for anything that was unreasonable, never trashed the apartment. For one, our rental agreement had 2 completely different addresses on it (did not notice until after we moved out). We never met her, or the house owner. We were given a key via lockbox outside on the porch. Everything was handled by email/text message. We did a viewing with the tenant at the time and the place seemed pretty decent. Upon move in day, the entire place was trashed, old furniture and food in the fridge. Dirt and sand all over the floors.  The house had rats, mice, ants and moles. We demanded they send someone to clean, and she agreed. They hired a lady to clean the floors and that's it. There was grease up and down all of the walls in the kitchen we had to clean ourselves. They rented to us saying we had 2 parking spots. We found out she was telling the other units they also had exclusive drive way access and we had to share the drive way with both other units when they moved in. Causing arguments for months with one tenant where we had to get the cops involved constantly for her threatening to destroy our cars/property. The porch light was never fixed even though we asked because it was a shared entrance and dangerous in the winter.. They never once checked smoke alarms or fixed the dryer when we had issues. The rental agreement showed snow/yard maintenance was taken care of by the owner of the house.. We were constantly having to shovel the drive way/sidewalks.. Eventually we got a text right after Christmas saying the owner was renting to a family member and we had to move. She offered to pay our moving expenses as long as they were reasonable because of the short notice and breaking of the lease we signed. We never got a formal eviction notice, but were constantly being told a realtor was showing the house and needed access to our unit. We refused to let them enter because we were not given notice. She turned nasty and refused to pay moving expenses/communicate to us. We eventually moved out and we found out they rented out our unit right away. I asked for rent receipts it took 6 months and eventually she googled a sample and wrote out the amount and names on top using MS paint. I give them a 1 for absolutely everything.",1,1,1,1,1

First they tried to evict us as commercial tenants so they could give our apartment to the scam artist they moved in upstairs (she was charged Samantha Stevenson or Evanna Lopez as she tried to go by, many news articles on her) they then let this scam artist harass us. The scam artist and her family did everything to try to make us leave from keep our apartment at sub-legal temperatures because the controls were in their unit to they would intentionally make loud noises in the middle of the night to physically intimidating us to making a false claim about us to police when she was caught driving her 2 young kids off without car seats to deflect from having driven 2 young children in car seats. We had recordings, we had paper trails, we had proof and this landlord did nothing about it. During the harassment, the landlord attempted to evict us 3 more times, all illegally. The landlord also revoked the backyard amenities when the neighbours moved in and offered to pay for exclusive use. Tom Rosa tried to get my partner in trouble at work using his position in the same company as part of their tactics to get us out. When they finally realized they couldn’t pull a fast one on us and the scam artist was charged leading to a quick midnight move leaving them high and dry, they sold the house but not before trying to illegally evict us during the process by claiming the house was already purchased and had to be empty for the new owner, the realty company said otherwise and then suddenly we were kept out of the loop entirely.

1598,RITA AND LARRY FROM GRAND RIVER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,N2B1N3,"Horrible landlords. The property management is also horrible. They never answer your calls ever. They only returned my call when I  threatened to file harrassment charges on my spying landlords. At first I thought my landlords were ok. Minus them talking trash about people in my building. This all started when I was dating a guy and we broke up and I had given him keys to my apartment. He refused to give them back and for my safety as we didn't have a lock on the building at the time I called them to see of they could change the locks. They came over and gave me so much attitude about it. Saying I'm not allowed to give ANYONE a key. I live alone and have no family and have 2 pets. If something happens to me then someone will be getting a key(atm haven't given anyone a key though for the past 3 years since this happened as I have trust issues now) one day in April 2021 I was waiting in my lobby for my Uber eats.we have a lock on our lobby door so that no 1 can even get into the building. Larry the male landlord was in our building(3 story walk up) I'm waiting down on the first floor. I'm waiting about 5 minutes. During this time the whole time he waited outside in the hallway spying on and listening to me and my transaction(receiving the food) as I'm going up to my apartment on the second floor I finally hear him go inside the third floor area(the hallway is small and u can hear everything) when I got back I'm livid. So half an hour after this occurred I called them to tell them my disgust on them spying on me. I told them I don't appreciate it. My landlord rudely retorts that is what happens when u are a drug addict and drunk. I'm disabled(Take prescription meds so if u are looking through the garbage you are a creep) secondly I work in a Brewery. I get free alcohol. And I don't even take my meds if I drink. I don't take my recycling out every week I take it out when my large bin gets full. Last I checked though prescription meds aren't illegal and neither is drinking. Even if I did weed (I didn't then, I take CBD now with a bit of thc for pain) that was legal since 2015. I moved in 2016, and this happened in 2021. I was so angry I called the property management several times(3 total) and left 2 messages about this and the last 1 threatening to file a harrassment charge on them. Only then did she call me back. (Grand River Property management) She came to take down a statement from them first and a day later me. I know because I saw her the day before with them outside. Doubt anything got done. She never said anything back so I again called her repeatedly and asked on a voice-mail what was being done. I got crickets. No response. Left a message to call me back. Last time i called and left a message demanding to know what she was going to do about this. She tells me she told them not to talk to me and advised me not to either. Like I have to when things need to be repaired. We have a note we fill out and they bring in amateur people to fix things 90% of the time. 
To note our building was built in 1964. I needed that info to set up my Hydro. Which my landlords told me. So our buildings electricity is always going out. Mostly in the summer, the dryer in basement trips out all the time, and the kitchen outlet I've had problems with since I moved in. So I called the fire department because I feared for my safety and cats when I work 12 hour shifts(ya still working disabled) he asked me to ask how old the building was. So I called them to inquire. Because I wasn't sure if it was 1962 or 1964. So Larry answers the phone again and denies he knows the answer to this. They have been living here years mind u(people setting up Hydro need to know that information) he tells me he doesn't know. I tell him well u had to give me that information when I moved in to set up Hydro so u do know. He starts yelling at me I'm wrong and he doesn't know. At this point I've had it with this jerk. I yell back u do know, and who's on drugs now?! And hung up on him. Fire department comes over and talks to landlords. He sent me an email telling me he told them they need to fix any issues that are a fire hazard. So I write out this page of 5 issues with 5 separate issues with different electrical issues. My kitchen outlet, my power always tripping out, the dryer tripping out in basement and the lights in the hallways always out so it's dark(I work nights and come home in the dark and sometimes leave in the dark depending on time change) he sets up an appointment with an electrician and I've had it with him. I decide to video him while he and this guy are in my apartment. I tell the electrician about all the issues and the guy says I'm just here to fix the kitchen outlet. I say but there is all these other issues and he says u need to talk to him(Larry who was standing in the kitchen with him) and I said I would but the last time I talked to him I got yelled at. The electrician sees my phone and asks are u recording me? I say im recording him being in my apartment as is my right(my property and i consent as I'm in the video and narrarated a few parts of the interaction. He doesn't say anything else about it. During this time Larry doesn't say a peep. Trying to be nice as pie in front of this guy. If I was alone he would have said stuff I know him. As they walk put the hallway i can hear them talking trash about me recording and i hear Larry say ya shes like that. Lol. I wonder why. I have to know protect myself. In case i need to go to court for these jerks. I've been here just over 7 years. So late last year they started fixing up the building. They put on a new roof, touched up paint in our apartments, put in brand new mailboxes, fixed the lights the ones in the front and back that go out every 2 months(no joke, the electrical is bad) they finally got brighter ones. Come to find put a tenant made a complaint about it being dark which is not allowed by landlord and tenant laws. I figure at this time they are fixing to sell the place. So anyways talking to a neighbor he is suing them. They took out the lights in the garages a couple select people have(12 garages and landlords own 4 for whatever reason. There are 22 units in both buildings combined.)anyways this tenant had heart failure. He was on the ground and thankfully someone taking garbage out found him in the dark. He also has black mold in his apartment they refuse to fix and they took away his stove and refuse to replace it. So he is suing them for the mold and almost killing him from lack of light in his garage. No 1 would have seen him and he could have died. He spent 9 days in the hospital and got a larger heart monitor put in from this accident. They tried to kick him out for them getting a negligent plumber in that didn't seal the sink in his apartment so it ended up flooding the downstairs apartment and they tried to say he owed over $1000 for water damage and if he didn't pay they would kick him out. Eviction. They gave him an N5 or whatever paper. That was last year. Clearly they don't have proof it was his fault and haven't pursued the eviction letter they sent. (N5 I think, I seen the paper and read it today) probably why they want to sell. Most of us are long term tenants some 20+ years. And are paying below market rent and they are getting sued for thousands of $ from this guy. They were sued before from a girl who slipped and fell. Also on that note 2 people slipped and fell within 24 hours because our landlord refused to salt the entry way. His wife ended up in the hospital as did another tenant in the basement. This happened this year a few months ago. Maybe February or March. Both had an ambulance. They are the negligent 1's, won't replace stoves which is against the tenant rights they MUST replace them, won't fix electrical that has high probability to start fires(which they would probably try to blame on us. Sorry Larry I have proof. I took pictures of the letter and time stamps of when I asked to get these issues fixed and u stood there and said nothing while the electrician said he was only there for 1 reason only) accuse people of being on drugs and alcohol without knowing the truth, are rude, abusive, gossiping about other people and harassing. I kinda do hope we get new management, and hopefully new landlords. These ones are probably early 70 to late 70's and are bitter people. Grand River Property Management Inc. Is useless also.

1607,CAPRIET,TORONTO,M4K 1V3,"I absolutely love the building I live in because of the people and location, however Capreit is not a great landlord. The lack of communication with tenants is terrible. Repairs take a long time, and when they are completed (by the cheapest contractors they can find) they aren't done properly. Often things need to be repaired again. There has been a lot of problems with maintaining staff in the office so they keep on having to redo things like locker or parking spot inventory because the person who did it before didn't keep it in a place where the next person can see it. It's not the end of the world, but it certainly cause inconvenience to tenants who have to keep filling out forms over and over.  There has also been a lack of common sense and competency when it comes to knowledge about repairs and the order in which things need to happen. They are consistently doing unnecessary cosmetic renovations like changing the furniture in the lobby or the office, or painting the walls, or updating the lights in the pool, but don't do the things that are really necessary like repairing a sauna that hasn't worked properly in decades, or reducing potential for mould by clearing water out of storage areas every time it rains, or fixing issues in tenants units in a timely manner. They also are as often as possible doing above guideline increases, and will fight property tax rent decreases from the city every single time. I mean from a business perspective it makes sense for them, but from a human rights perspective it's terrible! This February they reported a record 24.3 per cent average rent increase on turnover (increasing rent for the next tenant, after the previous individual moves out.) So if they take a really long time to do mediocre at best repairs, of course tenants are going to want to move out, which then allows them to increase the rent, and by making things look pretty cosmetically they can ask for higher and higher rent for new people coming in.  All that being said, I do acknowledge it could be a lot worse, as I've seen in other places, but it could also be a lot better! I wish Capreit would remember that their actions or inactions affect the life, physical health, and mental health of their customers, and would treat us, and encourage their staff to treat us with respect and dignity.

When the other tenants raised concerns he told them I didn’t wash my walls frequently enough.

Also, for a guy who threatens to charge his tenants a cleaning fee if the house is not clean to his standards, there was a layer of dust on the furniture in my room when I moved in, I could not walk barefoot in the house the first day without getting my feet dirty, and the kitchen cupboards were not clean either.  He was also disrespectful toward my housemate, who was an international student from India, speaking to her with a rude tone and not following up on his word to provide furnishings for her room (he kept his word to myself and our other housemate-- both of us had parents involved in the rental process whereas she didn't).

They made a giant fuss about a medical cannabis grow in the basement, which had a fully isolated environment.   These are legal under the ACMPR, providing the person it's designated for is also tending the garden.  They tried to argue using an outdated 1996 law, that doesn't apply and is fully superseded by the ACMPR.  This led to try to evict my family, and the stress and headache inducing nature of the ordeal caused me to move the garden.

They accused us of modifying the electrical panel, and making ""unsafe"" modifications to the house, neither of which we did. 

They gave us a large rent increase of ~14%, moving the rent from 2100 / month to 2400 / month.  After raising the rent they rapidly tried to perform a bad eviction on us, and refused to offer up any evidence of their endgame, which caused legal problems, resulting in us being unable to move.

When we were finally able to move, they wanted us to paint the walls, replace the carpet, replace counter tops, they essentially wanted a full house renovation.  

One time I was unable to be home well they wanted to ""inspect"" the property, my partner was there, they belittled and degraded her the entire time.

They refused to put any money into the house, so any minor interaction with most of the interior left smudging, staining, and marks.

1683,WAYNE AND LINDA WATT,SOUTH PORCUPINE,P0N1H0,"Initially thought they were personable and friendly when I first met them. As our tenancy went on, they evolved to become very intrusive and abrasive. We kept them informed about any issues that arose, as there were a few that would adversely impact their property value/cost a lot of money in the long run if left without intervention. They were quite hostile to us informing them about issues and acted like they were doing us a favour by fixing it. They lived around the corner, so repairs were pretty quick, though fixes were often “half-assed” and ineffective. They did seem to care about safety, as they did conduct a number of inspections throughout our year long lease, though they abuse the 24hr inspection rules and conducted numerous inspections over a 4 month span, that definitely could have been completed in  1 or 2 visits. The inspections felt intrusive rather than practical, couldn’t help but feel like they were trying to catch us doing something that they could berate us for. Smoke detectors all worked, we purchased our own carbon monoxide alarm because the ones they provided were ceiling mounted. We observed that they drove past the house frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, and our neighbours informed us that they saw them trying to peek into our windows on numerous occasions. The next door neighbour informed us that the wife was bragging to him about entering the unit without our knowledge or consent. We had hoped to live there long term, as it was a nice and spacious apartment listed for a reasonable price. Unfortunately living there was not worth the reasonable rental prices as the landlords were intrusive, disrespectful and abrasive. There were a few uncomfortable situations, but there was one in particular where the landlords screamed at me in the front yard for all the neighbours to hear when I responded to their question with an answer they were unhappy with, it was embarrassing and made me cry. I no longer felt safe in the dwelling and we moved out as soon as our one year lease was up. After we had moved out, we learned that some of the neighbours had taken bets on how long we “the new couple”  would last in the apartment, because the units have a history of being a revolving door of short tenancies due to the disrespectful and unreasonable nature of the landlords. I wish I had known that before signing the lease! Ultimately it is a nice and spacious apartment in a decent location for a below market price, the unit was clean and there were no issues with mold or pests (aside from the landlords themselves).

They will also raise your rent (within the bounds of the law) yearly.  They definitely overcharge based on how hot the market is.  
In the context of Longwood Apartments, the new superintendent is trying to catch up with years of disrepair in this building, so repair can often be slow or left incomplete.  However, the new superintendent keeps the building very clean and is very responsive to questions.  There are no issues with bugs or rodents of any kind (to my knowledge).  The building is quite old though - so while this means the rooms are better insulated than newer buildings, it also means that there are no anti-scald valves on the showers so they are prone to scalding you (on the bright side, there is always hot water).  The building is hot-water heated, so you cannot control the temperature of your apartment.  It can get very hot in the winter, and there is no air conditioning in the summer (no window AC units are allowed, but you can use other forms of AC).  The shared laundry is kept clean, but there is only two washers and two dryers (coin-operated).",4,5,4,5,5

One person let his dog defecate on the corridor and on another occasion a homeless person gained access to the laundry room and slept there. Security does nothing and tenant parking is also a mess.

As a current tenant, I can attest that the shared areas of the condominium are consistently dirty and never properly cleaned. It's clear that the landlord is neglecting their responsibility to maintain a clean and safe living environment for their tenants.

My unit is outdated and poorly maintained, and I've had to deal with several issues related to plumbing, electricity, and heating/cooling. When I've brought these issues to the landlord's attention, they've been slow to respond and often provide band-aid solutions rather than addressing the root cause of the problem.

Finally, the repair and maintenance procedures in this complex are simply terrible. The landlord seems to have no interest in investing in quality repairs or maintenance, and as a result, tenants are left to deal with ongoing problems that could easily be prevented with proper care.

He fixed kitchen plumbing, reinstalled a hoot handle and realigned a doorframe for us, and even reinstalled a lighting fixture.

We had a few problems with other tenants (usual noise complaints, etc) and Bernie and Oksana mediated as best they were allowed when things escalated. The issues with those tenants were eventually why we moved, but when we had to take possession of our new place early, they were happy to refund our last month's rent (as they found a tenant to sign a lease for what would have been out last month of tenancy).

Overall they were reasonable people taking decent care of a much older low-rise building by the Lakeshore.

I did learn, upon move-in, that Hanlyn provides incentive to their tenants and contacts to leave positive reviews, however the incentive would certainly not be enough for me to keep quiet about any day-to-day issues if I were to have any, so I don't see this as particularly ""scammy"" - more like thanks for helping out with a little Tim's card.  Regardless, my experience from viewing the unit to signing to move-in and now active tenancy has been fantastic.  I'm a licensed paralegal and was very pleased to witness the company follow all legal procedure and requirements of the RTA throughout every phase of the process, including proper standard Ontario lease agreements with correct clauses in place, and RTA approved timeline commitments for various considerations.  They provide an online maintenance request portal where you can request urgent or non-urgent maintenance support in your unit - I have always had maintenance requests replied to within 2 hours tops during business hours, and I've never experienced more than a 48-hour turnaround to have maintenance out to my place for minor/non-urgent requests.  There is an afterhours line for urgent requests outside of business hours.  Any maintenance or fixtures I've requested have been completed very quickly and to my satisfaction.  The unit was extremely dirty upon move-in and hadn't had a thorough clean between tenants, however I acknowledge that it was being shown for upwards of 2 months and many people were in and out of the unit during that time.  I recently received notice of spring maintenance, and they came by to do a check of my smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, cleaned out dryer vents, and hooked up outdoor water supply.

I wish the LTB would take tenant matters as serious as they do Landlord matters, as I stated we filed a T2, and he filed an N12 4 months after we filed. And his case was heard before ours. The system is totally unfair and broken. We fiance can't even do laundry, because his apartment is right across from the machines. She is absolutely terrified as he has threatened us with violence multiple times, which we have numerous police reports against him. During his unauthorized N12, which under oath he claimed he would be taking our apartment for himself, he put the building up for sale. Bottom line... STAY AWAY from this property.",1,1,1,1,1

She also warned us about repairs and that he will use every excuse possible just to not pay for repairs,and many other shady practices that we only started to realize after we had been there for just a couple months. Fast forward,a fire happenned on this block and our building was untouched, it was also at the beginning of the month so we had JUST paid rent. but he sneakily got us to move all our stuff and put into storage because supposedly there was some work to be done to our unit, then tried to claim that because of the fire this was a frustrated contract, and he gets to rent it to someone else if he wants to and doesn't need to refund the rent paid for that month AND was keeping out Last month rent and completely ghosted us. We got help from.the Ontario tenants group and long story short took him to the LTB. He missed the first hearing and lied that he didn't know about it, but the LTB wasn't taking that excuse. And after seeing how far we were willing to take this and that he risks to get fined by the LTB,he started offering the unit back claiming that he didn't know the laws, mind you this landlord is a lawyer. So the idea that he doesn't know rental laws is just pathetic as this info is available with a little research. Long story short,he begged us to withdraw our LTB claim in exchange of 2months free rent...we ended up negotiating 3 months, and  he wanted to split our storage fees and refused to accept full responsibility.  This became just a frustrating place to live and after another year of him making our lives a living hell we ended up moving out.",1,1,1,3,1

 If you don't answer her texts within a few minutes she will continually text you, call you and even email you, whether you are at work or sleeping or even in a hospital, or even dealing with a death in the family according to her you should always answer her, in her opinion you should also be like best friends with her and text her every day.

There is on-site laundry that hasn't been repaired in at least 7 years so tenants are told to use the laundry across the road, which is actually decent but if you're going to tell people on-site laundry it should be available. All leaks in the apartment were met with a No Frills bag instead of being sealed or investigated. Upon moving into the apartment no cleaning was done and he tried to blame my roommates and I for the level of dirt despite photos from move in showing otherwise. When asked when our oven would be cleaned (as it was unusable upon move-in) he tried to bill my roommates and I for the cleaning. During the actual cleaning, he didn't know I was home, he was talking poorly about my roommates and I and threatened violence. The Bylaw officer in South Parkdale knows Edward and his various properties well. After the oven incident we hired a lawyer and he yelled at us and the lawyer for A) getting a lawyer and B) yelled at my roommates and I for talking to other people in the building.

It was incredibly troubling and we ended up taking her to court. It ruined our first rental experience, wholeheartedly. I couldn't believe this could be allowed. Not only to enter my home with no notice, but to essentially split my rental home into two. What these landlords get away with is sickening.

No more than one pair of shoes in the main entrance, nothing on the landing going down to your unit (not even for a few hours), nothing on the porch, nothing outside your door. Cold, heartless glares from Marisa whenever crossing paths. Alyssa issued me FIVE eviction notices in the 13 months I was there and they were all thrown out when we got before the board with her having to pay me. During my prep for our trial I contacted the tenant prior to me who vouched for her insane behaviour and expectations of a tenant. This is clearly a pattern and they are not capable of cohabitating with anyone peacefully in that house. Not to mention the apartment is a shoebox with terrible temperature regulation - it’s either too hot or too cold, with minimal sunlight from a window under their deck.

1807,ADRIAN AND CRISTINA OF CELLUPICA INVESTMENTS,ST. CATHARINES,L2P 2E5,"These landlords care nothing about the tenants and solely about money. The apartment I rented from them looked “renovated” but was in fact barely holding together. The floors were peeling up, the windows (ones that actually opened) didn’t have proper handles, we had to use adjustable wrenches to turn the knobs. The biggest windows in the apartment didn’t open, were stuck shut completely. The ONLY AC unit in the apartment was very small and could not keep the entire unit cold. When I asked if I could install another window AC unit I was told no and to shut my blinds to keep the hot sun out (genius!). It was a 3 unit building, with 1 washer and dryer - that flooded the basement on MULTIPLE occasions. Meaning I’d have to take my kids and I laundry elsewhere to have clean clothing. They decided that the house didn’t need any grass, or any kind of yard and paved it. Great! The only problem is, it’s a 1 way in 1 way out space. A VERY narrow driveway. Getting a vehicle in and out of there was AWFUL. They expected 3 vehicles to park there when we struggled to put 2 cars side by side without hitting eachother.. want out of the driveway? 8 point turn. Make sure you don’t hit the broken, falling over fence that is covered in nails that stick out and will slice your hand - like it did my daughters. When you bring any issues to the attention of Adrian he will call you and belittle you. He will call you names, he will tell you how rich he is and how he doesn’t need to deal with any of this. When you bring anything to Cristina, she will talk to you like you’re below her. On multiple occasions, the tenants they moved in below us were extremely loud and disrespectful. When I reached out I was basically told it’s a shared building and to deal with it. 
And when I finally had enough and decided to move - Adrian said “good! Now I can raise the rent!”

1814,LEVENT SAHIN (LMD PROPERTY HOLDINGS),OTTAWA,K1N 8J9,"This is a true leech landlord! 

He refused to maintain the building to health and safety standards even after the city's orders. 
He tried to trick us into leaving our lease early so he could raise the rent +$600. 
He illegally renovated (by himself) the other unit in the building from a single dwelling unit into an illegal 8+ person rooming house. The recantations were constant, all hours, and weekends. None of those tenants were on leases and all paid under the table illegally.
Levent was constantly on the property with no notice at all, letting himself into the building and using the backyard from morning until night.  Every single week our entire front yard was FILLED with his garbage. 
He constantly had screaming fights with a friend of his he let move into the building. 

Literally none of our appliances worked (fridge, washer/dryer, dishwasher) and he threatened to call the police on us when we requested repairs saying it ""wasn't his problem"" ""he doesn't understand the rules and we are racist for asking him to learn them""  and ""you're using them wrong"". 
When we reported a leak in our sink he told us we were being dramatic and he wouldn't help us. Then the leak spread through the house, into the downstairs unit, through light fixtures ripping through their ceiling, and into the basement. He then tried to frame us for insurance purposes so he would not be liable. 
When he came to the unit for our insurance information, I asked when he would be coming for repairs...He then called the police on my father an I (the police literally laughed at him and told him he has a legal responsibility to maintain the property.) 

After months of harassment and poor living conditions, we tried to bargain to leave our lease with one month notice but he refused unless we paid him more money. The day before our move out, he broke a window in another unit and tried to frame us for ""throwing a party"" and causing the damage. He called the police on me again when he saw our moving trucks and filmed me an inch from my face aggressively, threatening me again. In the end, the police were involved 3 times because of this unprofessional behaviour.

We did not have working blinds in our unit for the majority of 3-year stay, and there were issues identified at move-in that were simply never resolved (ie, no drawers in linen closet or kitchen pantry). Hydro in the building would be shut off at least a few times a month. 

Most importantly, when I moved out there was very little communication of how to arrange the elevator or when inspection would take place ""because move outs don't usually happen on weekends so there is no staff available to support"" (???). They then overcharged me another month of rent when we already moved out, and it took 3 months to receive my money back after weekly reminders and check-ins.

Once everything was dried and cleaned up they arranged for professional carpet cleaning and completely tore open the ceilings, let dry for a few days and replaced and even painted the room in my choice of colour (I did have to provide the paint as it was standard apt white).

They made it impossible to leave and everything in the house especially the basement had to be thrown out because it was either full of mould or stunk like mould. They showed no compassion and made no efforts to resolve the issue. The garage in the back was about to completely collapse and didn’t close properly. There were also rats living in the garage and in the garage !!!! All of our things in the garage was destroyed by rat poop.

They refused to give me my last months rent back knowing I was going on my own and they said they would have no problem filling the property immediately. They also changed the locks on the door before I was done moving which prevented me from getting my own property. Absolute disgusting individuals. If I didn’t have so much stress already I would’ve taken them to small claims to get my last months rent back and some compensation for everything I had to throw out due to the mould infestation. The house was a previous grow op I found out later and the landlord Neil was in on it along with prostitution rings going on.

Parts of it are literally rotting. He won't get anything fixed. There are multiple serious issues with apartments on the property that make it unsafe, which he has ignored for years. When he does have something fixed, it's usually a stopgap. (Check out the pillar holding up the east balcony, you'll see what I mean.) Approaching the city will get you the minimum possible response if you're lucky. I believe he relies on tenants with low, fixed, and/or unstable incomes who can't afford anywhere else.",1,1,3,3,2
1842,ERIN K WEILER,ETOBICOKE,M8X1G3,"I lived in the house as a shared tenant for 5 years. Did everything by the book, paid rent on time (some time even a week in advance), communicated well, even during pandemic. After 3 years landlady/ ""roommate"" who did not even live in Canada, decides to raise rent above the state percentage claiming utilities have gone up, etc. and cos she dint raise rent first two years cos of pandemic. I paid for the 3rd year, and 4th year to avoid conflict. Over the 5 years, whenever she came to town twice a year and stayed for 4-5 days, i had to sleep at a friend's place even though i paid rent, cos i could not switch on AC (Jul) and heater (Dec). She asked me to get a personal space heater, so i had to invest in one even though the apartment had heating and cooling included. She would use my utilities and leave the house a mess for me to clean asking me if i had a vacuum, as if i was her servant. I even had to pay cleaners to come in to do a deep clean in 2020/ 2021 during pandemic cos she would not maintain anything in the house cos she was not in town and all the previous tenants leftovers were everywhere. I did not know this at the time and assumed everything was hers. The whole responsibility was on me, even picking up her mail. 

In the fifth year she decides to raise rent again by a ridiculous amount, and i told her i'll confirm. Sent her the rent as usual and 3-4 weeks later before the next increased rent was due, she lands in Toronto from LA, whi8le i was at work and breaks into the house without giving me any verbal or written notice, takes off safety locks and asks me to leave the premise on the false note that i had not called her or picked her call. Staging it as an emergency and using the loophole in the system. 

The house has not undergone maintenance in the 5 years that i had been there, except for AC filter changes. Even when the microwave broke down(4th year), had to plead her to get it fixed. The bathroom shower handle leaked and broke due to no maintenance, which even the plumber noted on his visit after much pleading. In spite of having kept the place immaculate in the 5 years, the day she broke in she said the place was a mess, that she felt threatened by me and that she wanted me out in 2 days. All this and she is the one with the locks on her room door. She threw out all my food in the garbage and thrashed all my things. She then argued and fought with my guarantor who also owns and apartment in the same condo.

There was also a time when i had my guarantor over at my place at one of the times she was in town. She brings out a Swiss army knife and shows it off to me and my friends, almost like a threat. Which we at the time thought was very odd, but continued to disregard cos she was never around for too long. She also claims to be a lawyer, but is no longer a practising one in Canada or the US.

It was unfortunate that i don't have the money to hire a lawyer to serve her, so i had to bite the bullet and move on. After much contemplation i also realized alot of red flags and that this was not her first time. She had fed me and my guarantor a sob story on the day i moved in that, her sister was the last person to live there and that her sister up and left without giving her any notice. I cannot help but think it was another poor soul like me who she manipulated and did not give deposits back and ate the last months rent from too.

Anybody renting from her in the future, please be aware and warned. She is very volatile and unpredictable. Im glad i never stayed aro0und while she was there cos i dint know if she would have poisoned my food or went through my personal things.",1,1,1,1,1

Also, when you call the management office they hardly answer, but know how to ring down your phone when they need to reach you. They also raise rent without leaving proper notices and threaten to take you to court if you miss 1 payment.

It has cost me in laundry money and requires me to live for 21 days (between sprays) with all my clothing and belonging tied up in trash bags. I’m hopeful that the new exterminator company they are using AND the diligence of the new Superintendent will begin to get this under control. I’ve been pushing despite being concerned about been marked as a trouble maker for not accepting this as status quo.  
Bayshore has not yet completed the minor repairs they agreed to have done BEFORE I took occupancy. I’ve been here over a year now. Also still waiting for the agreed upon window screens. I don’t want another spring/summer without being able to open my windows.

The building is also poorly maintained. It reeks like cigarettes in the hallway and the spider webs are endless. They make small (landlord-special) upgrades, but you lose a privilege every time. For example, when they redid the parking lot they took away all visitor parking. The building is loud and not a great spot for middle-aged working professionals and the building security is lacking. There is an issue with people breaking in and taking Amazon packages (a step in the right direction would be moving the superintendents to the first floor to monitor who's coming and going).

Her mortgage increased due to BoC interest hikes that she assumed would be covered by the tenants. The small bungalow was full of mold and appliances were broken. The furnance/air conditioning broke down and this was also the tenants responsibility to repair. She continuously threatened to evict so she could move back in though she had no intentions. She is charging over $3,500/month plus utilities for an 1100 square foot bungalow in a crappy area.

Sandy was polite, but had zero idea how renting worked. (Having tried to raise the rent illegally twice by demanding over the legally allowed amount) There were a couple of maintence issues that were brought to her attention, but only half were actually addressed as she had to be reminded multiple times, and followup did not always have an issue resolved.

By the time they got there...Edith's spy tenant had called her and had her on the phone telling her about the situation. She instructed the firemen to not knock the door down that it would be too expensive to repair!!! At that point another tenant said she had the spare key for that apartment as it was her friend's unit. They both lived alone and thought it be a good idea for each other to have the spare key. The door got unlocked and it turned out that the lady left a burner on and a dish towel was laying near by and started smoking. Once the situation was resolved, the landlord gave the tenant grief for #1 giving a spare key to her friend in the same building. #2 for having the accident with the stove and #3 to me for calling 911!!!

They also have lied to the fire department about the state of the fire alarms in the building, they told them they had fixed the fire alarm pull systems, when they hadn't.

They take every opportunity to snoop and spy on tenants to find excuses to evict us. They issue illegal entry notices, for example a notice that covers two or more days with no time of entry. They don't give 24 hours notice, they drop off notices as late as 6 pm for a 9 am entry the next day. They lie on entry notices about the reason for entry so they can snoop. If they do a big repair the owner sneaks into the apartment and rummages through the tenant's belongings. This man is verbally abusive and berates the tenant for having items he doesn't approve of. I'm disabled and he tried to force me to get rid of my walker. The building supposedly allows pets, but if they see cages or other signs of pets they call Ontario Animal Control and file false cruelty complaints to force the tenant to get rid of their pets. They try to bully and harass people to pay illegal fees, like $500 per air conditioner. They don't notify tenants about upcoming power or water shutoffs, all announcements are posted on the wall beside the elevators, so if you don't leave your apartment you don't get notified. My apartment is a slum. The kitchen cabinets have fallen off the walls twice and I had to nail them back up. The kitchen hasn't been renovated since the 1960's, the linoleum is almost worn through and the knobs on the cabinets are unsafe - I catch my fingers or my nails in them. There's no counter space and I have to use a kitchen cart. My fridge door is held on with duct tape. My stove drawer is broken open and from a different model of stove. Their cheap parquet wood floor tiles pop off from wear and tear and then they accuse the tenant of deliberately pouring water on them. If you ask for repairs they try to blame you and threaten to charge you and/or evict you. Same goes for bug spraying, I get three kinds of ants, spiders, flies, roaches and bedbugs. I have to seal food containers in Ziploc bags and keep them in the fridge or freezer. When I asked for spraying I was told I caused the bugs and would be billed for the exterminator. The real reason for the bugs is that my apartment is next to the garbage chute and they never spray or clean it. Foul odours and bugs from the garbage chute enter my bathroom vent so I have to keep the door closed. .",1,1,1,1,1

Some mold problems and there had been a pharaoh ant infestation that has come and gone for 3 years. They just spot treat an apartment when there’s a complaint and ignore the rest until another apartment is infested. Rent is ridiculously high considering building is old and you don’t have in suite laundry or a dish washer. $1500 plus for one bedroom and $1600 plus for 2 bedroom. Parking outside is $100 a month in a small town. You get gouged on laundry and they added a fee every time you load your card. They remodelled a few years back and the sound proofing is horrible. They tell you you can only have one pet which is illegal in Ontario. Also the office is shady.

I have lived in their properties and viewed several, there are bug infestation and animal concerns in many, which many tenants have been flagging for years. 

During the move out / viewing process, they allowed people to touch and move personal belongings (some missing items) despite a distinct promise to ensure safety and privacy during the viewings. They were not willing to work with us to be present for the viewings.

Very prompt responses to maintenance requests - staff will even reach out to follow up on issues, to make sure problems are not happening again. Friendly and professional staff who seem to know the names of not just all the residents in their buildings, but regular visitors, too! No pests beyond the odd silverfish. Common spaces are brightly lit and cleaned regularly. Regular maintenance is done on the property (painting hallways, duct cleaning, parking lot repairs etc.). Landlord follows all rules about proper notice to enter units and increase rent (which they will do each year). 

My only complaint is the extensive application process. By far the most detailed application I've had to fill out when applying to rent somewhere. They will ask your bank to provide a statement on your banking history and average account balance. They also ask for your SIN - but you do not have to give it to be accepted as a tenant (I did not). When I rented, they asked me to sign a statement that it was a pet-free building and I would agree not to have any pets. This statement is contrary to Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act (landlords cannot prevent you from having pets once you live in the building, as long as these pets are not causing problems for other residents). In all fairness, despite having me sign this statement, Westdale does not even try to enforce these agreements. Once in the building, residents are asked to fill out an annual fire update sheet, which includes how many pets are in the unit. And there are many dogs and cats in my building!",5,5,5,5,5

Responsiveness is erratic - sometimes it is immediate and sometimes it takes several emails and calls over weeks. If you need repairs or anything, good luck. They will either not respond, try to suggest you fix the problem yourself with your own money, or try to blame and charge you for the fix.

Charlie was fairly ok about replacing or fixing things (namely the power kept going out) but other things (washer/dryer) kept having issues that were never resolved. He had an issue with privacy & boundaries. I guess he figured because I was renting his bsmt, he could just show up & enter whenever he wanted. There was one time (early Saturday morning) when my daughter (a baby at the time) & I were sleeping. It took her ages to go to sleep so it was late when we finally fell asleep. I was woken up to a loud pounding at my door & my phone ringing. When I answer the phone, it was Charlie's wife calling to tell me that they had guys waiting outside to clean the ducts in the bsmt & that I had to let them in. There was no prior warning, heads up or anything. I had to wake my daughter up & then rush to get some clothes on. Charlie's wife showed the guys where the vents were & then just left the guys down there with us. 

After confronting Charlie about this incident, he blew up, got violent, started cursing obscenities at me saying I was being difficult & he's never had this problem with other tenants. This all happened because I simply asked for a little consideration in the future in terms of access to the unit. I explained that I get there's maintenance & such that has to be done but letting me know ahead of time is considerate among other things. It takes no effort to send a text message to let me know that they need to get into the bsmt for whatever. Apparently asking for a heads up was me being difficult. Charlie cursed at me again saying that I was costing him money & making the work take longer than necessary. There was another similar instance where another repair guy was supposed to show up & never did but apparently told Charlie at 9 something at night that he was still supposedly coming. I ended up sitting up till 10pm waiting with my daughter because Charlie said this guy was coming. When it hit 10:30pm & I told Charlie that my daughter & I needed to sleep, he again got irate saying I was costing him money & that he will have to reschedule for the repair guy to come again, etc...

For a bit after that, Charlie would send a text ahead of time for whatever but then he stopped. He & his wife went back to just showing up at my door. Another time I was working (I work from home) & with no warning, Charlie shows up with a whole crew of guys who start using power tools in the bsmt. I couldn't finish work & was forced to log out for the entire day. The guys seemed to think it was funny that I was there trying to work & I guess didn't realize that I would be in the unit in the first place. Another time, Charlie showed up with a city inspector to check the bsmt (apparently someone complained to the city about too many cars in the driveway), the inspector saw my daughter & I then said that he couldn't check the bsmt but that it was illegal & we would have to vacate. Other than Charlie's attitude, we lived in that bsmt unit for over a year & a half with no problems but were forced to move.",2,2,2,1,1

There are no baseboards. Light fixtures had mice poop in them. When the kitchen faucet started leaking water everywhere, she never fixed it and we had to buy a new faucet (which she has never paid us back for).

Just a few (of many!) examples: I have been left for months with a leak in my bathroom ceiling and a huge hole, I have been in the past left for SEVERAL weeks with no heat, and if you have heat, it’s scorching hot where you have to turn the AC on in the middle of winter. There’s TONS of garbage behind our building that they have yet to get rid of (months). 

At one point they contacted us to tell us they had a change in management and things would get better. They did replace our balconies, but this place needs SO much work. If they got their stuff together in the repairs and upkeep department, this place would be a dream. 

Last thing I’ll say — once they finally started working on my bathroom leak/ceiling, the contractor was going in and out on different days and times and one time, they showed up unannounced, I was in my bed SLEEPING because I had worked nights, and the Super knocked, came in, and LET THE CONTRACTOR IN WHILE I WAS SLEEPING AND DIDNT WAKE ME UP.

In the 3 years I've been here, two storms and subsequent power outages occurred that damaged my shed from their trees they refuse to trim or remove. The street i live on has not been swept for years and creates respiratory issues- lot fees we pay are supposed to cover road maintenance. 
Roads are full of potholes and my neighbor injured herself falling in one just the other week again. Every year they apply to increase rent past the 2% allowable amount claiming they made 'upgrades'. They also claim we have 'amenities' and 'common areas' which we certainly don't. 

During the first power outage residents here were without power for 2 weeks because they would not remove their tree from a power line, insisting the home owner would do it (they were out of town and it wasn't their responsibility).

They also release names of all the home owners in each park when they are trying to increase lot fees by 18%- clearly they do not think they have to follow any laws.

Property management is unresponsive, unhelpful, condescending and rude.

Another tenant who lives here told me that I may not be able to take my furniture when I leave due to bed bugs potentially. They rope you in with “Two months free rent ,” but that’s usually to cover up for their shortcomings. This place is so ghetto , homeless people come though here sometimes . Talking to management to get shit done is like pulling teeth . Read the Google reviews about St. Laurent Towers . If you want to stay sane , then don’t move here . These buildings need to be demolished.

2074,TERRI LYNE HUTCHINSON,WASAGA BEACH,L9Z2X2,"Terri Lyne has several last names. Allen, Carlson and Hutchinson. 
When we seen the place and signed the lease, we discussed what would be included in the rental and signed the agreement, gave an illegal damage deposit, plus first and last assuming we were getting everything included in the lease and what was shown us.  Throughout the year that we rented her place at Bells Park Rd she constantly texted and called to talk unprofessionally about her personal issues or ask questions about the apartment. She went back and forth on things that were included in the rental, for example, the washer and dryer use was in the lease and several times she took the use away for unreasonable excuses, the use of the backyard was in the lease given we got liability insurance to cover things as there was a pool and firepit back there (which is completely fine and understandable) It seems she forgot our agreement and insurance she required us to obtain, and told us we couldn't use the back yard due to liability and chained it off.   In the agreement we agreed every 6 months to have a walk through of the apartment to check fire alarms and the condition of the apartment (which no issue there). But she made reasons to enter the apartment once a month, if not more.  We had zero privacy in the unit. She made us feel like unwanted house guests more so than tenants over paying for a small 2 bedroom apartment. 
When I announced I was pregnant she wanted to charge my 2 year old daughter and unborn baby extra utilities since there were going to more people in the unit, and when we refused she tried to hike up the rent. When we threw the Ontario rent increase laws at her she decided to take away the washer and dryer use completely and became very cold and hard to deal with. 
The one good thing about her I will mention is that she loves and takes pride in her home so any repairs that needed to be done she was right on top of them in record time. That part was awesome and appreciated. 
When we gave our notice, she wrote us a letter of recommendation for our applications as we took care of her place very well.. But when they called her she had nothing but bad things to say about us costing us to loose several houses we pretty much had. 
She had us give an illegal damage deposit because we have a dog and a child, but when we moved out she ignored our request for it back, and has also not paid her portion of utilities for the last 2 months as they were required to be put in our name while living there.  She isn't responding to our calls, texts or emails.

2083,SKYLINE,FERGUS,N1M2Y6,"The building I lived in was an old building but very well maintained.  It was owned by Balnar Properties.  They were working on gutting each apartment and making them new again.  My apartment was beautiful.  The rent was reasonable and most of all we could pay EMT which allowed me to pay bi-weekly (always half a month ahead).  They were fine with this and always got rent on time.  When the snow fell, we got a notice immediately to clear out by next day to clear the snow.  Management would go out and shovel in the interm. I couldn't speak more highly about Balnar and the way they took care of tenants.
Skyline bought my building and several others in the community.  I can say everything did a 180.  Opposite to Balnar treatment.  Now rent was auto withdrawal only, No snow clearance, tenants (including disabled and seniors) were told to maintain there own parking space.  apartments had an ""as needed"" approach to them.  When the building would have repairs, like a roof, the tenants were billed for it in a rent increase.  When tenants moved out and new moved in the bare minimum was done.  My friend moved into a Skyline apartment with 4 or 5 different floors, and floors had chunks out of them still.  When you filed a grievance, it took months to be addressed.  When something needed fixed, again weeks to months to be fixed.  A fellow tenants toilet broke.  They handed her a bucket and said use this til its fixed.  They are a greedy money making business who couldn't give 2 shits about humans living in there building.

In addition, she required an illegal pet deposit on top of first and last months rent. Needless to say, she did not give the deposit back even though our dog did no damage.

Mgmt at 145/165 Queen Street S are great folks at this point in time. The new staff have been responsive in replying to my concerns. (especially if more urgent). However this could change since there's been a fair amount of turnover with staff for my building during my time here.

Unfortunately once things go to Q Residential corporate, little is done in regards to non-urgent repairs. I waited 4+ months for water damage to be fixed on my wall before a subcontractor came. As well, my heat was supposed to be fixed two years ago and hasnt been fixed. All staff have been able to do is put a work order in and much doesnt happen after that. One half of baseboard heating works in my living room, so its quite cold in my unit in the winter (sometimes 16 degrees or lower). This is completely unaccetable and is a by-law violation in my city.

I'm staying here since rent is reasonable considering rental prices in Hamilton. Newly rented 1 bdrm units in my building are going for $1700 now, which is ridiculous for units with continual cockroach problems, and difficult neighbours depending on your floor. (ex: 165 Queen Street S Floor 3, has one neighbour who has been difficult). Mgmt has done alot to resolve things in this regard thankfully, but its still challenging. Mgmt has been proactive in treating my specific unit for cockroaches, but its a continual problem within the building. Other tenants have had bed bug issues, but thankfully I havent had this happen.

Most tenants living in my building are nice folks which helps balance things out considering the frustrations I've experienced here in my stay.

Over the course of a couple years I had a cockroach and bed bug infestation the pest control company would take over a month to come each time I made a complaint about bugs — they also didn’t seem to be spraying much of my apartment. There was no residue from spraying on a lot of my furniture and only after complaining and accusing the exterminator of not spraying did he start to treat my unit. The landlord never took responsibility for damaging my property and failing to treat the infestation nor would they provide credit to use their laundry room, which is part of the treatment for a bug infestation. Overall I probably spent 5 grand replacing furniture when I left the building. 

The building manager and his supervisor were abusive and acted like tin pot dictators when attempting to get them to actually address the issues outlined above and other issues I have not included.

2. There is no concern for privacy. Drunk landlord(Issac) would bang main door in the middle of the night.
3. Cleaning the common area was landlord responsibility and they never did(hired anyone) for it.
4. Internet sucks. And when I complained about it many times Issac verbally abused me.

They also engage in illegal rent increases through sneaky means. I was told the garage was to be renovated, with my parking spot temporarily moved outside. When renovations were 'finished', I was not informed. Then had my fees jacked way up after asking to move back inside. 

Terrible bookkeeping as well -- we would frequently get eviction notices for non-payment of rent EVEN WHEN WE PAID IN FULL. We would have to go through the entire ordeal of contacting a paralegal and going through the tenant board only for them to block it (obviously, since we paid!).

- unclear how to make maintenance requests; there are paper forms that never get answered when submitted, and an online tenant portal that also doesn't seem effective. usually I just call or email the office now, which seems to work well enough. 
- Generally responsive to maintenance issues overall, including plumbing and drywall repair concerns. Less likely to fix smaller items.
- Frequent water shut off notifications that never actually result in the water being turned off, which is mostly just weird. 
- There were false alarms from smoke detectors occurring pretty regularly for a while but it looks like they upgraded the building's system, which is good
- VERY inconsistent staffing, which can get confusing. There's usually 2-4 couples working on site as support, office, or cleaning staff, but the turnover is incredibly high which leads to inconsistency in the way that you communicate with them and can negatively impact the cleanliness of the buildings/property.

Weeks after giving them my money and signing documents I get a call from the realtor asking me about my dog, which I found strange told them more about the size (small) and moved on. 

The next day they suddenly reach out telling me I need a co-signer, I who lives alone, single, no credit issues had no one to cosign for me they then told me I could give another two months rent to secure the unit. 

There was no way I was going to shell out 5 months rent - so they claimed I caused the deal to fall through and cancelled. During this time the LTB was closed and backlogged, so Royal York kept my close to 7k and withheld it only giving me a contract to release 2k of this money.

In desperation I did (I was now out of an apartment and had to live out of a family friend's whole in limbo looking for another opening for an apartment with another company).

When I had some appliances that needed repair, they dispatched a repair man very promptly. The only negative is the usual cheapness in the repairs.

From that point on the harassment began. He threw temper tantrums when I wouldn’t just leave. He called the cops on my girlfriend and accused her of trespassing, yelled and screamed in my face and basically acted like a child when he didn’t get his way. He went as far as calling the cops one night claiming I assaulted his mother when she tried to talk to me about the drying running at 11pm. His mother and he lied to the police and told them that I pushed her and they wanted me arrested. Thankfully I had a camera in my unit that captured video and audio for the entire night and it showed that I hadn’t gone near them and there was no noise suggesting a struggle (mother claimed she screamed when I pushed her).

2246,ZULICH ENTERPRISES LIMITED,SUDBURY,P3E2K6,"Zulich was horrible. My bedroom had water leaking through the ceiling and dripping onto my bed. The brown water stain on the ceiling was a metre in diameter. Another water leak occurred above my bathtub, and eventually resulted in a hole in the ceiling 7” in diameter. I also had significant buckling of the parquet flooring, about 10 sq ft.

I informed the building manager numerous, numerous times about this, I also filed formal maintenance requests, and called the head office (no one answered the phones). It took them over a year to respond. Their “fix” included paint over the damage and not fixing the actual leaks. The paint wasn’t the same shade as the original, so there was a giant extra white square on the ceiling. The leaks persisted and just caused water damage and brown staining over the paint jobs.

During COVID-19, they made laundry free, only to increase the cost of laundry immediately after masks were no longer required in the province.

One of my parents unexpectedly died, and I was late on one month’s rent as a result. I told the building manager about this and that I’ll pay the rent in about a week when I got paid (I just returned to work after my dad’s death) again, and a week later I got an eviction notice. I was going through the most difficult time of my life. I had a good paying job, but because I had to be home to take care of the aftermath of my father’s death, I wasn’t able to go to work, and thus, get paid.

A month before I was moving out, the building manager decided to tell me that I had access to an underground parking spot and locker despite them assigning me an exposed parking spot when I first moved in.

I lived in two different apartment buildings with Zulich, and the “updates” they did to these units was reminiscent of the early 2000s despite it being 2018-2020. “Landlord special” type work. They also love having your fridge door open away from your kitchen. Just absolute laziness of their contractors.

1. Because of the shoddy work done by her husband, the basement ceiling is leaks water. The first time she seemed concerned. However as leaking kept happening, she starting dismissing the obvious water damage as condensation. 

2. Upon looking at the property, she said the items in the backyard would be cleared out. Upon moving in I soon discovered that her husband uses the backyard as a dumping ground for old AC parts, scrap metal etc. Whenever my boyfriend tried to clean up the place and put his junk to one side, he would just dump more stuff all over the place. 

3. They started construction upstairs and they cut through the ceiling and we had ceiling debris fall into our food while cooking dinner. They regular had saws and hammering going on after 7pm and on the weekends. When we reached out to the landlord, she said we were being immature and she didn’t have time for this. 

4. I subsequently called 311, because her husband and the workers they hired wouldn’t stop. At that point they began sending harassing messages to my boyfriend. 

5. When we gave notice to end the tenancy, she refused to respond to any realtors. She would answer and then say she would call back and never call back. As a result we lost out on a few homes.

To anyone that sees this review...please do yourself a favour and avoid this property management company specifically at Top of the Valley Apartments located at 44 Valleywoods road in Toronto Ontario. I think this is the first review I have ever felt compelled to do ever in my life but I feel it is necessary as I wish I saw a warning like this when I was looking for apartments. All I can say is do not trust Estelle as she is not educated enough to hold the position she is currently in and if financially possible, look elsewhere for a place to live. I am not going to ramble as it make the review sound like I am holding a grudge and acting on emotion. Us tenants need to share information to help each other out and to call out Landlords when they are in the wrong and that is what I am trying to do with writing this.

Thank you.",1,1,1,1,1

Boiler died and took months to get back online, no attempt to provide space heaters, and didn't even bother to provide a timeline or update until group of tenants went to office and complained in person. Property manager called and lectured me about the fact there were moving boxes in my apartment when I was in the process of moving, and threatened to drag me in front of the landlord tenant board for asking about other units they had available as ""I hadn't informed them I was moving out"" despite not even yet having viewed any of the units, let alone decided to move.",2,4,4,3,2

Pros:
- Dedicated weekly garbage removal 
- Excellent response rates to environmental problems like plumbing, AC
- Maintains appliances at optimal condition
- Offers full kitchen, two bathrooms and an on-site washing machine and dryer (washing machine/ dryer accessible after 7PM or weekends)
- Speaks English / Vietnamese

Cons:
- Will make tenants responsible for other tenants living in the space (Example: Tenant leaves for vacation and fails to clean their food out of the fridge, will make the remaining tenants clean it)
- No pets allowed, will lead to eviction of animal
- Brings strangers down or enter the unlocked basement area with little to no warning
- No rent relief during Covid
- Dismisses tenant concerns in regards to other tenants
- Fire alarm always goes off whenever using oven

This 'guy' is Davide Weiss, king of the Etobicoke NHL worthy backyard rink.  Let's buildings fall apart, can't keep staff (because he treats them so badly), doesn't vet staff (new superintendent was picked up by police after 6 weeks with 5 outstanding warrants...for serious crimes).  Doesn't hold property manager accountable for vetting tenants.  Two buildings are overrun with the 3 horseman of pests:  roaches, bedbugs AND mice.  Treatments are not performed to eradicate but to satisfy Toronto By-Law and yes, this landlord has a file with the city.  Must upgrade electrical, fire plans NOT up to property standards and yet Toronto's own RentSafeTO gave all the buildings a pass.  (That's a failure on the city's part).  Probably the only landlord with empty units because he wants top dollar but units are in such poor condition, they aren't worth it.  Currently, 1 super is a bully trying to evice paying tenants so he can re-rent higher and the other super is nosy, always looking over your head when you answer the door.  Landlord does not care for tenants, just wants their rent.  He will say or do anything to placate tenants.  The only thing he understands is a By-Law mandate from the city and fines for non-compliance.  And even that has a tough time getting through his head.  Avoid at all costs.  The only reason most of us are still here is because building is rent controlled and we have finally learned how to entertain ourselves by filing T2 and T6 to get landlord's attention.  ",2,2,2,4,1

2301,SKYLINE LIVING,KINGSTON,K7M5X1,"After moving in to a unit it became how apparent both the previous tenant and the staff care about cleanliness: Dead bugs on window sills, lots and LOTS of hairs in the bathroom, mysterious gunk on some surfaces in the kitchen. 
Some maintenance issues from day 1 as well, which they took several weeks to respond to - all things they should have looked at during the moving out of the previous tenant IE cabinets coming off at the hinges. 
Besides the above I have had no issues major issues besides cigarette smell in the halls at any given time despite a no smoking indoors policy - living there has been smooth for the most part following the gut-wrenching cleaning I had to do on the first day of living there. There is the occasional night of loud music or partying; the few times this has been unfairly disruptive IE 1am on a Tuesday the landlord is quick to respond and ask the other person to quiet down which I do like. 
It’s not necessarily a problem but I would like to note on here that the building staff find some reason or another to enter your unit typically once every couple of months; they do this after providing written notice and it’s usually just to flush the toilet during the day. 
They are a good landlord overall, if you are anal about good hygiene and having things in good repair then I would avoid. Skyline staff if you are reading this - I mean no disrespect, I know some of you work hard to maintain the building and grounds, but people need to be warned in case they expect something cleaner/nicer given the high cost of rent.

They are constantly raising the price of the laundry machines even though if you fill up the washer you're going to need to run the dryer AT LEAST twice. Awfully convenient to raise laundry prices while your dryer is barely warmer than room temp. 

They raise the rent literally every chance they can. Since moving out my current landlord has not raised rent one time despite my place being wayyyy below market rate already. 

The stove they provide is from the 70s or something. You know that gross yellow/beige coil element stove your grandma had? Yeah you still use that if you live with these guys. 

My apartment had no less than 5 different types of flooring. Basically made it look like I was living in a building made of glued together popsicle sticks.

2378,NOMAD HOMES INC.,KINGSTON,ONK7P0S4,"Rented from Nomad Homes, didn't really interact with the landlord at all, but the leasing staff was great to deal with, and they were quick to help address any maintenance concerns.  Beautiful house that we lived in for just over a year.",5,5,5,5,5
2379,LINDA PANNELL,KINCARDINE ,N2Z2Y2,"Extremely nice lady, very understanding, very prompt and easy to get in touch with. She genuinely cares that the units are nice to live in. She’s not looking to screw people over, she is a nice person who wants nice tenants. She treated us very well!",5,5,5,5,5
2380,HAZELVIEW PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,GUELPH,N1G2L1,"Avoid all properties managed by this company, formerly known as Timbercreek Property Management. They are extremely disrespectful of tenants' rights and will make any excuse to raise rent prices. When they hire maintenance services or pest control, they will never do the job correctly, leaving their buildings a mess of poorly implemented 'repairs' and completely infested with cockroaches. The plumbing, heating and elevators break on an almost weekly basis and they will do only the most shoddy patch jobs to fix it. ",1,1,1,1,1
2381,SHAHINA KURIEN,PORT ELGIN,N0H2C2,"Put the house up for sale shortly after signing a lease, which meant for a year, at the peak or COVID, we had strangers coming and going through the house. She tried to get us to move into a different property so the house would sell faster, but only at a higher rate. She acted like she was doing us a favour for following her legal obligations as a landlord. She cashed out key deposit cheque even though we returned the keys. ",4,5,2,2,1
2382,MARC HABIS,ETOBICOKE,M9P2M6,"I have rented from Marc for 3 years now, overall he is a great landlord. He is understanding when situations arise (like during covid there was a month where I wasn't able to pay on time and he had no issues waiting until my next payday because I had communicated with him before the day I owed it that I would not be able to) 

He has never raised my rent my entire time living here, and he is usually quick to get back to me if I have any concerns or need repairs. He is a small time landlord, I believe only 1 or 2 rental houses and he is overall a stand up guy.",4,5,5,4,5

He raised my rents calling it a tuition fee and now all the prices for homes has gone up. 

He tricked me and now I'm priced out.",1,1,1,1,1
2387,RANI BEHARRY,TORONTO,M5S2P9,"Owns multiple properties within the area, all varying degrees of liveable. Acts nice until you move in. Repairs are rarely completed by a professional unless you really fight for it, and she is impossible to convince to handle pest control, would always rather take the cheapest way out with no regard for tenants experience. Will threaten you if you push back for your basic legal tenant rights. 

Also takes advantage of young international students and at one point hosted 4 students in a tiny two bedroom basement apartment without firesafe windows.

She does not care for her tenants. Slumlord. 

Also is a doctor who isn't allowed to practice in Canada but does so anyways at her father's clinic under his name. Funny how tenants who apply have to jump through hoops when she is the landlord you apply to 

Avoid at all costs. ",1,3,1,3,1

2390,GUS SKARLATAKIS,YORK,JANE,"The split units at [address removed] are unsuitable for sharing. The landlords do not care about the tenants or encouraging a respectful and dignified separate living situation. They do not adhere to reasonable requests in a timely manner, or refuse to acknowledge the need for improvements. The units have zero sound barriers, and share utilities which is unfair and unsuitable for a peaceful living arrangement. Be wary of this house, the landlords who are just there to make a quick buck, and the property manager who in unequipped to handle your needs. ",1,1,4,5,3
2391,ELAINE PLATT,TORONTO,OVERBROOKPLACE,"Elaine Platt, and her family member Debra Platt are extremely unprofessional and unpleasant individuals. The lack of respect they have for the tenants and for their own building. No maintenance, just neglected and mean people. They will go out of their way to make you miserable and uncomfortable. Unfortunately there's landlords that shouldn't have that privilege or title. Awful experience renting from Elaine Platt at Overbrook Place, North York, ON Canada ",1,2,1,3,1
2392,JOSEPH FALLETTA,ST. CATHERINES,FACERSTREET,"Joseph and Annette Falleta are the worse landlords I've ever had in my life. 
The landlords coerced me to pay rent early and threatened to evict me if I didn't, and carried though with their threats with a fake n12. The rental complex has violent tenants that make noise and have overnight parties. The common area hallways in the building is saturated with cat urine, and cluttered with belongings from the tenant in unit 3. These landlords do not take complaints seriously about noise, violence. They do address maintenance issues and do remove bedbugs if need be. 
Joseph is a short tempered angry person that goes into rages. He even goes into rages at ltb hearings and has no regard for his tenants, the ltb staff or the RTA. My advice is to stay away from renting from them. ",3,1,2,1,1
2393,CHERYL BRANDON,TORONTO,ETOBICOKE,"Cheryl is your quintessential ""slumlord"". She refused to make needed repairs, citing she was ""too busy"", and repeatedly threatened us with eviction and venous litigation.

2396,DAN DIVMOSKI,WINDSOR,N9A2H9,"Landlord has let property fall apart. Fixes are all a Dollarama special if you manage to get anything fixed without filing a bylaw complaint. There are cockroaches and mice that they don't treat properly. Theres mold growing in the walls and laundryroom. Appliances don't work properly. Shower is leaking and was supposed to be replaced over 2 years ago. Theres no soundproofing you can hear the conversations of every other tenant. You unit will constantly smell of heavy cigarette smoke or meth from the neighbours. Landlord will not show up on time to conduct repairs or give proper notice. Landlord will cause problems between tenants by spreading lies about other tenants and blame them for his failure to be a good landlord. You'll want cameras in your home. Not a dime goes to matinence just in his pocket. Doesn't make crucial repairs for saftey, let the fire escape rot through and would not repair.",1,1,3,1,1
2397,LIYUAN (WINNIE) HOU,RICHMOND HILL,L5H2P4,"Horrible landlord with extremely poor communication. She does not go by any laws and literally does whatever she feels like. She does not respond or provide any written notices, everything is through WeChat messages or voice clips. She ""does not believe in written agreements"" and this is where I fell into this scam because we did not sign an agreement so there was never clear details to the terms of the rent. When you inquire about the room, she will tell you there are no rules, that you can leave any time no strings attached, that she is very open and approachable and she will try to help you adapt to Canada. The longer you stay there, you will start to realize that she will impose more and more rules and restrictions leaving you no choice but to leave. When you try to leave, that's when she will tell you that the agreement is for one year and that you have to pay for her losses up to 1 year rent. This landlord rents our rooms to students new to Canada and she specifically targets these people to take advantage of them. I was a victim of this and I would absolutely recommend anyone to avoid this place if you had any other choice. If this is your only option, please please make sure you ask for an agreement detailing the terms of the rent, make sure she will provide you with a lock and key to your room and make sure you understand all the rules before giving her your money.

Some things that I have experienced during my time there....

She invades my privacy by entering my room when I'm at school during the day, she does not allow me to use the kitchen to cook (after cancelling the meal plan with her), she does not provide the proper heating or cooling to my room (I literally need to walk around with a blanket or have my jacket on in the winter time or have a fan blowing on blocks of ice in the summer). She did not provide proper lighting to the room and does not even allow the light fixtures to have all the light bulbs installed. When I informed her that I will be ending the tenancy next month, she immediately kicked me out without any proper notice, literally sent a WeChat message and excepted me to leave within 1 week. She did not return any deposit or let me use my deposit towards a last months rent. She constantly harassed me and emotionally abused me via WeChat voice messages until I moved my belongings.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1,1,1,1,1
2398,SPICE CART LIVING (MANAGEMENT) ,TORONTO,FORRESTHILL,"The building is falling a part, and property management deletes service tickets without replying. The 24-hour emergency contact information is just their office number and they never answer the phone. If you're prepared to live without heat, with mould and be ignored, then maybe live in one of their buildings. And the laundry machines break every week.  Otherwise, there are units that charge just as much in this city that are much more inhabitable than Spice Cart Management / Living ",1,2,4,1,1
2399,JONATHAN ZHAO,OTTAWA,OLDOTTAWA(EAST),Was completely mislead into renting this apartment. Not a true 1 bedroom as back wall is paper thin which allows even quietest noises from other 4 person bedroom unit to radiate into the apartment. Avoid at all costs. ,1,1,1,1,1

2401,KATHY VUKOBRAT,ST. CATHERINES,NORTHEND,Amazing lady. Once offered me a rent reduction while the backyard was unusable because of her dog needing the space but I’m already paying half the market rate of the unit. This review probably will never matter because I’m never going to move out but I just want to say something about the only decent landlord in Canada.,4,5,5,5,5
2402,FRED MONETA,TORONTO,M5S2K9,"The house was very disgusting. There was a black fly infestation and mold in the bathroom. The landlord also showed up without notice all of the time and never gave notice. I decided to leave early because of these issues. I still payed out my two months noticed and was told that he would look for someone for those months. I was not allowed to advertise the place myself. He did not look and instead signed a new lease for after my two month notice, so I had to pay double rent. Overall while the house is in a really nice location not worth all the hassel. It is also extremely overpriced since all you get is a bedroom and a tiny kitchen and bathroom. Nothing is updated and while a cleaner does come in once a month everything is so old it's just permanently grungy and dirty.",2,1,1,1,3
