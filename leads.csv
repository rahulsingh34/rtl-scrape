0,ALFRED EPP,LETHBRIDGE,ALBERTA,T1J 5J4,CA,"Worst landlord I have ever had to deal with. One thing I will give is price was fair for what we were paying for. However, he did not do any upgrades he promised in the leased (we had an unsafe unfinished back door that didn’t lock for the entire lease). He came unannounced without 24h notice, and called tenants names to belittle us. Do not recommend.",2,3,4,1,1
1,MKCC PROPERTY,REGINA,SASKATCHEWAN,S4P2M8,CA,"Great landlords. I've barely had to reach out to them. When I do have to reach out to them, issues are dealt with or addressed within a day or two. Any pest reports are taken very seriously and permanent fixes are put in place. Other problem tenants are addressed. about 2/3 of most of their apartments is carpet which sucks, but all repairs are done quickly. The one exception to them addressing problems is my fridge that sounds like a jet engine at times but that's with all apartment sized cheap fridges I think.",4,5,5,5,5
2,TANGLEWOOD PROPERTIES,GRAND RAPIDS,MICHIGAN,49506,US,"Things I haven’t liked:
1. Advance notice of visits is almost never given.
2. He tracks in mud and doesn’t clean up after himself. Got dust all over my stuff while doing construction.
3. Left a trailer full of trash in backyard and was rude when I brought it up. The trash was even falling out and spilling all over into the yard. It rained on it and I was the one who had to clean up the smelly, dripping-wet trash bags.
4. Maintenance and repairs can be slow. He’s spread too thin and probably needs to hire someone or delegate certain things to a property management service.
5. Provided appliances are pretty much always 20+ years old, energy inefficient, and barely functional.

Things I have liked:
1. Usually reasonable and responsive.
2. Rent increases have been reasonable and generally below market increases.
3. Has been flexible about certain things that he could have raised issue with.
4. Friendly and mostly leaves me alone.
5. Lawncare is timely. Email/text responses are timely.
6. He genuinely puts a lot of effort into making his properties nice before renting them out.",4,4,5,3,4

She uses this fake business as an excuse to corner us into discussions (never about her responsibilities: last time it was to accuse us of not paying rent and request screenshots as proof) without providing the required 24h notice. The rooms suck, there's no livable common area and it's still like 1k per month. She does not provide the necessary amount of garbage bins for the size of her rental households and refuses to do any outdoor maintenance. She also controls the heat and AC against our will even though we are the ones paying for Hydro.

If you forget once she will abuse you fiercely in online group. She always announce that she treats you as her family member. My dear sir/madam, do you ever have one of your family members urging you to pay rent every month although you never miss paying a single cent to her? Sometimes I even pay her rent 1-2 days advancely since she even sends you messages to ask for rent on holidays!

As a high-rate tenant, I always pay rent in time, keep the room clean, but she never feel satisfied and send messages even phone calls during my work time! As a car salesperson, how can I answer the phone call when at an appointment with my guest, and to hear her ""PAY ME RENT"" or ""IS THAT YOU WHO DID NOT THROW TRASH""?

Besides, I live with my girlfriend and we have two cars. She can only provide one parking postion. I asked her many times to help me get an extra parking position, or obtaining parking permit, she never did it. She once told me that I can park at visit parking in the neighborhood, I did and got a $45 ticket. Actually I got totally 3 tickets and worth $125 totally, she never thought she would be responsible for this. I was even willing to pay $200 monthly to get a driveway parking, she could not still find sth for me. Imagine a landlord being useless in solving significant problem that the tenants have, and keep abusing them at online group because he once forgot to throw the trash!

This apartment complex made me feel so unsafe, they were blatantly turning a blind eye to things like people walking their dogs without a leash. People going way too fast in the complex when the posted speed limit is 5 mph. People breaking into cars. They have a police station on the complex and they still don't help. We had to contact them multiple times to get a bee hive out of our balcony roof and they didn't come a single time. I even called them to tell them they were coming in through the windows, that my cat was starting to try and hunt them and that it was turning into a safety concern and they still never came. We had water damage on our ceiling on the top floor and the roof was visibly coming in. Don't believe their prices that they list either. We had a one bedroom apartment and it was listed at 950 or so online but when we signed the lease all the extra fees made it actually 1500 a month. And if you cannot pay it by the 17th they will evict you. And if you're disabled, if you live alone, if you have trouble at all with legal jargon or the math that goes into why the price is that much, and need extra help, they will not help you. They are very rude and they make you feel stupid when you have any questions. There's mold, there's bugs, the air conditioning is absolutely terrible. We had to have our wall unit on full blast all the time and it wouldn't travel into the bedroom so it was miserably hot all year. Even when it was snowing. The counter tops are very cheap and weak. The floors are cheap and there are nails that stick out from the edges and you need to keep pounding them in so they don't hurt you. You can hear your neighbors tv the walls are so thin.

Their maintenance people take regular care of the exterior, but they rarely come around themselves. We're quiet w/no pets and always pay rent on time or early so I don't have info on how flexible they are with regard to pets/noise/financial issues.

Dedicated onsite staff drink on the job and threaten tenants and their children. They try to intimidate tenants to leave so they can charge more for the rat infested buildings.  This is at the 775 concession st buildings in Hamilton. Anyone choosing to move here make sure you make records of EVERYTHING.

He seems to think that providing a dodgy house and taking $1.2k+ a week is the only requirements for a landlord. Privacy was 5 stars because we never heard from him.

29,CLOSE 2 HOME,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K1J 7M9,CA,"Martin Guenette has negatively affected my roommates and myself so heavily that every time I rent with a new company, I am anxious and afraid that I may have an experience even remotely similar to one we had with Close 2 Home. The image that he puts forth to potential incoming tenants is highly deceptive and does not at all reflect what the actual rental experience entails. After agreeing to wait some extra time for cleaning on move-in day, our move in to the unit was significantly delayed simply because he allowed the previous tenants to stay an extra day (even though the lease in our names had already started). When we arrived, the unit was full of garbage and broken glass, and all surfaces were sticky. There were major maintenance issues (e.g., broken dryer, malfunctioning internet, massively leaking pipe) and problems created by the upstairs tenants were left unaddressed to a point where it was impossible to have safe, peaceful enjoyment of our property. Martin often flat-out ignored messages of concern, and when he did respond, it was in a way that was not only disrespectful but also ableist (e.g., using the r-slur), condescending, and misogynistic. When I expressed that we did not feel safe, he responded by text (verbatim): ""I cant control feelings... havent mastered that yet.."" We arranged a telephone meeting to discuss our concerns; when I mentioned the possibility of bringing concerns to the LTB if they are not addressed, he used a metaphor to imply that if we do that, he likely won't show up the next time there is an emergency. He did not give us sufficient notice for apartment tours (maskless, during peak Delta wave) and exhibited a general carelessness towards us as tenants. All four tenants left before the end of the lease, one of us being harmed so badly that within 1 month of living there, they had to drop a required university course purely for the sake of moving out.",2,1,1,1,1

This was my first time renting and during the signing process, Erinn was very transparent and made sure we were aware of our rights as tenants. It was clear throughout the lease that they actually cared about their tenants' well-being and saw us as people rather than just numbers. They were receptive to our needs and patiently listened to our concerns. General repair was not great, as the unit ran into a few issues (e.g., very poor insulation, malfunctioning outlets, oversensitive fire alarm due to no range hood over stove, wasps, squirrels) and while several of the issues were addressed in a timely manner, the person doing these repairs was not particularly handy so the solutions put in place were questionable and/or didn't last. We did not renew the lease mostly because of structural aspects of the unit and aforementioned issues.

32,CLOSE 2 HOME,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K1J7M9,CA,"Martin Guinette (Close 2 Home) was unfortunately the most irresponsible landlord I have experienced. I lived in a basement unit managed by him, underneath tenants who were a risk to our sanity and safety, enabled by the landlord. The apartment upon move-in was full of glass and mice and had a dryer that was not hooked up correctly, causing dryer exhaust to fill the house. The apartment, which was advertised to come with internet, did not during the height of online schooling. Upstairs tenants at one point created a situation that required us to call the fire department; Martin, instead of helping solve the issue, threatened us if we went to the LTB for safety concerns. We attempted to have a professional and objective meeting with him to solve the problem, in which he told us he ""could not control feelings"" when we said we felt unsafe due to the fire. His solution for the upstairs neighbours' excessive noise 24/7 was to suggest we swap units.  When we stated we would not accept a rent increase with this solution, he gave up trying to help us altogether, leaving us in so much misery, all 4 of us on the lease moved out before the lease was up to prevent irreperable emotional damage.

37,AMALFI MILPITAS,MILPITAS,CALIFORNIA,95035,US,"The apartments themselves are great. Structurally sound, utilities work well, maintenance is effective and friendly. Management (local management, that is) is generally helpful and responsive if an issue arises.

The issue is, none of those people make the decisions about rent, privacy policy, or what tenants are allowed to do with the space they pay for.

Rent increased by $700 (~30%) after the first year at the apartments. They get around the legal issues of this by registering as an LLC and presenting the first year of rent as a 'discounted' rate - so technically, I lost a $400 discount and rent went up by $300. I have no confidence that rent will remain at a reasonable rate going forward.

In terms of information privacy, it recently came to my attention that when approving me for a lease, management ran a background check without informing me, which violates California law (ICRAA). In terms of physical privacy, it's generally fine. Maintenance comes by a few times a year to check alarms and water meters, but they give advance notice and knock before entering.

Management has not taken any discriminatory action against anyone I know at the apartments. They have, however, sent out emails complaining that our patios have laundry hanging out to try, as that 'harms the value of our community', suggesting we must take all non-decorative items off of the patios. Minor gripe, but when you're paying more than $3000 in rent, it seems to me you should be able to put whatever you damn well please on your patio.",5,5,2,3,4

Property manager will give you the silent treatment if you request they do anything within their job title, often bad mouthing and complaining about other tenants. Continue to hike prices of rent despite age of building, no upgrades to unit, and does not have proper aor and ventilation.

Now, I can see charging for a parking spot i  the limited underground parking. But charging us a fee to park outside is ridiculous. 

Starting to think a ""Tenant's Union"", some form of Collective Bargaining may be the next method of ""airing of grievances"". I know at least one person on each floor who is sick and tired of the heavy handed way ""Q"" tries to ""do business"". Ms **** O specifically has been a sticker in many tenant's craw.

We STILL haven't had our Residential Managers replaced. So she may end up having to be MORE involved. No thanks. 

If we could afford to leave. We would. But buildings around here with elevators (which I require for mobility reasons) raise their rents to ridiculous levels when people move out. Staying put limits how much my rent goes up year over year. So I guess to control my budget, I'm stuck with this mess.

I just feel like ""Q"" is all about the dolla dolla bills. Chisel every penny they can out of their tenants. And to a point we just gotta ""Suck it up"".

I know they already had a meeting about my first review. So let's hope they at least START to get the message. We (their tenants) are SICK AND TIRED of being nickle and dimed by this soulless corporate giant.

55,PK HOUSING,GRAND RAPIDS,MICHIGAN,49504,US,"I lived at their Diamond Place property for a year. TERRIBLE experience. Roaches/ants/gnats throughout the building. We had them repair our washer as it wasn’t working when we moved in, it then broke about 6 months later and it took them a month to fix it. No offer of taking money off of our rent for the inconvenience. We had asked them to let us know when they were coming to fix it as our work schedules vary, but they couldn’t even give us a  specific DAY that they were coming. Low and behold the repairmen walk in one day after a MONTH of waiting, absolutely no warning, and I’m in the shower. Their solution to repairing our garbage disposal was that we just needed to flip the breaker every time we needed to use it. The property manager thought it was ok to just walk into my apartment no warning so that she could drop my Christmas packages inside so that she wouldn’t have to wait in the office and could go home early. Terrible communication from the whole office, they never answered the phone and when you would go down to the office everyone would be in there “working” (they were all sitting on their personal phones). The worst part of all is that they tried to wrongfully evict us as we were paying the amount on our rental agreement every month, yet somehow they had an amount that was about $100 more than what was listed on the agreement. No mention of a problem of us paying rent on time every month but somehow $100 short until we got an eviction notice on our door and hundreds of dollars in “late fees”. The property manager had no idea what was going on when we went to talk to her and she was very little help, just telling us that she would have to wait to hear back from PK before knowing what to do. We than had to wait over 2 weeks to hear back while being terrified the whole time of being wrongfully evicted.

The materials for the renovation are extremely cheap, and some corners were cut, but overall everything is functional and easy to take care of. When I had an issue with my shower, they had a plumber out to fix it in a day and a half. The plumber was really nice and did a good job. My rent is on the low end for the size of my unit, and it only went up $60 last year. I don't know how much it's going to go up this year, so that's concerning. A positive thing, we didn't have recycling pickup when I moved in, but after I and some other people asked, the building now has a recycling container! A lot of other apartments I've lived in in Tacoma didn't have recycling pickup, because the city doesn't invest enough in a robust recycling system and would rather blacklist addresses for putting the wrong stuff in their bins than create a better system. Anyway, it's great to have recycling. In my experience, Park 52 is not an actively harmful property management company, they're just fine.",4,4,5,5,4

Complained to the manager, they came by to look and said they’d stop working with that contractor which was good. However in the spring there was a serious leak problem in the kitchen that was rotting out the walls. Slow response despite there being severe mold and flies. Contractors had to come many times and keep uncovering worse damage to the wall.

It is all about maximizing profit factor for himself and the owners of homes/apts.  He finds ways to goggle by fraudulently adding charges for utilities to the wrong tenants while also charging the right tenant at the same time to pad the bank accounts.  He provides rent free to people who agree to work for him that are wholly unqualified.  He doesn’t make sure that septic is pumped out when your basement smells like it is backing up.  Doesn’t repair holes in doors or broken blinds.  You are expected to provide new blinds or curtains.  Landscaping - forget about it. In my time renting, I paid to have nasty landscaping replaced, paid for septic to be pumped which hadn’t been done in years (home was previously managed by Roe Rentals) and replaced lighting, painting.   For a Forest Hills area home - it was gross.  And to be treated like I was a poor slob was very degrading to say the least.   It is arrogant people like him who give landlords a bad name.

135,REDSTONE MANAGEMENT COMPANY,PROVO,UTAH,84606,US,"1. There was a large hole in the side of the wall of my bedroom. It was there for at least 7 months before I physically pointed it out to the 7th cleaning check crew before it was repaired, in spite of maintenance requests.
2. For almost a week during a cold snap, our apartment had no heat. This was not rectified until after another tenant in the complex threatened a lawsuit.
3. When I signed the rental agreement, overdue rent was $25 fee. A month later, they changed the fee to $75 without calling me in to sign new paperwork. They shut down a petition to get the late fee returned to the original price, and only changed it back after a lawsuit was threatened. The new rental policy which will take effect in August now states that prices will be on a first come, first serve basis, with those lucky enough to sign the paperwork first will get one price ($10 more than the current rent), while those unfortunate/dumb enough to sign later will pay $20, $40, and $60 more per month respectively. This includes tenants who would be resigning to stay in the same location, not just new tenants. 
4. Never had any issues with privacy.
5. When called out on the rental agreement, management sent out a plea for us to just not get angry and pay the increased fee. When rumors started spreading that at least 60% of the tenants would be leaving at the end of the payment period, they sent another email begging us to stay, insisting it wasn't their fault that they made those decisions.",1,1,1,3,1

138,CHALET APARTMENTS,TOPEKA,KANSAS,66606,US,"Went without AC for over 6 months, refused to work with us on it. Most ACs in this apartment complex are from the 50s, 60s, and 70s and the staff will openly admit this to you. Once our AC was finally repaired, our heat broke within a week. 

During the winter months, it takes days for them to come out and salt the sidewalks and they never scrape the snow off the roads. Because of how the apartment is laid out, this makes it a very dangerous place to exit and enter. The roads are not safe, and it is their responsibility to make them safe.

The landlords tow any car that is parked incorrectly within the day, usually within hours of the incident. I will receive close to 5 emails a day sometimes of cars mis-parked, and that they will shortly be towed. I don't think this is because of complaint from residents, but the maintenance staff is tasked with finding cars where they don't belong so the apartment company can make money with the tow truck company

I was also told that pet rent was $20 a month. I paid a $200 holding fee for said apartment on top of my application fee. 
     A few weeks later, they called me to set up a move-in date and she was trying pretty hard to convince me over the phone to sign the lease before I actually saw the inside of the apartment for myself. She told me that she didn't know when it was going to be ready and that maintenance was still working on, but I could go ahead and sign the lease and she'll let me know when it's ready to look at. I insisted that I see the apartment before I signed anything. Not 10 minutes later she called me back and said that it was ready to look at that day, Monday. 
     So I went in to look at the apartment, and the first thing I noticed when I walked up to the building was the busted up front door covered in painters tape that was wide open. She promised that somebody would fix that before I moved in, but I was still wondering where the maintenance staff was on a Monday considering the huge safety risk. We walk in, and immediately I see dirty rags and garbage on the floor of the lobby and the building smelled like mildew. Again, promises that housekeeping would come by and take care of it. We get upstairs to the actual apartment, and the door was all beat up and dented, scratched, dirty and everything else. The manager struggled to open the lock, probably because it looked like that one was busted too. One more time, promises that it would be fixed. We get inside, and it's not even close to the apartment that they showed me in the pictures. It was a lot smaller, no balcony, no open floor plan, no bed that folds out of the wall, no renovations, nothing. Pet rent was also $35, almost double what he told me when I applied.",1,1,3,3,3

Plumbing is horrible. If I let the tub drain and flush the toilet at the same time, there's a leak going into the unit below this one. Took two years to get the plumber to stop the water leak from the tub faucet. And landlord told me it's not his problem to fix the mailboxes. Keys have broke in the lock for the entrance/exit to the building more than once.

He did enter the apartment one time without us present or having previous knowledge in order to spray some cedar-based pesticide. He was going through all the apartments in the building spraying, and since we weren't home when he knocked on the door he entered and we weren't notified. I would have preferred he text us to let us know, or put some signage up in the main area in case other people also weren't home. We got home from grocery shopping to find strange smelling ""water"" along the baseboards in the living room, and ended up calling him about a leak that we couldn't figure out where it was coming from. That's when we found out he was spraying in the building (he was already gone). But he was being prompt as one of the other apartments reported some sort of bugs and he didn't want them taking hold or spreading. We never saw any roaches or had bug issues, just regular shield bugs/pine beetles that you find around wooded areas.

Bedbugs came out of the walls and were not acted upon by management until a singular bug was captured in a ziplock bag and shown in person. Until then, we were accused of lying about them. Of course, they were out of control at this point and almost all of the furniture had to be trashed. If you have friends, they cannot park here. They leave junk cars in the visitors' spots, so then they can tow you when there's no room, even if you're only one space away from visitors' parking, and you have a valid parking pass. (You'll need a new one daily by the way.) Got towed multiple times for this reason. Was not out of the question to hear gunshots sometimes or just people yelling loudly outside your door. Also, good luck getting help if any appliances stop working. You're completely on your own there. If you HAVE to live on McCallum, go with Chatham Court.

I also had a bird's nest living above me in the attic space. I worked from home then and had a dog, and it was madness trying to work with my dog hearing a bird and its babies all day. I sent a video with you clearly able to hear the birds inside. Instead of listening to me, Sarah gaslit me and told me that an animal couldn't get through the house's soffit. I provided her with more video evidence of the birds inside the walls, and she still told me it was impossible until I was able to send her a video of the bird going into the roof of the house; only then did they consider any repairs (this probably took close to two-three months to resolve). She also wrote a defamatory letter to me upon moving out, speaking about how I was raised and saying crude things about my character and dog. I had to take Sarah to small claims court because of the outrageous things she claimed upon my moving out. Just to let you know, during our time in small claims court, she mentioned that she had been here for similar reasons over 5 different times. In the end, I was awarded some of my security deposit back because of the wild remarks from Sarah and her complete lack of proof, as she didn't document that apartment upon move-in. I later met a friend through a friend who also rented from Sarah the previous year and had a similar, if not worse. When I moved out, the neighbors next door also approached me. They said they also had a really bad experience with Sarah as their neighbor and a complete lack of respect for those around her rental, and they mentioned that repairs on the property are few and far between.

161,"STEWART BEAL, BEAL PROPERTIES",YPSILANTI,MICHIGAN,48197,US,"Good luck hearing from Stewie Beal after you sign your lease and move in. Beal is incredibly responsive when you're looking for an apartment, and will even give you his personal cell number so he can respond to you ASAP. That behavior will change after you move in. Once you're in your new place, you'll never hear from him again! Ypsi residents call him a slumlord for a reason. No matter how desperate you are, DO NOT rent from this man unless you want problems. Beal is known for having some of the lowest rental prices in Ypsi, and sometimes he even waives application fees when you apply for apartments. However, he uses those predatory financial tactics to get people who are desperate and lower-income to rent from him (they cant afford to take him to court). When you do move in, if there are issues that require maintenance, they will most likely not get fixed. I lived in a 2nd floor unit and my neighbor below me told me that I needed to let him know whenever I need to use the bathroom and flush my toilet. Turns out, anytime I flushed my toilet, water would leak onto his BED on the 1st floor. This was incredibly hard to deal with, especially if i had to go the bathroom late at night. We both put in many maintenance requests over a period of months. One day maintenance showed up randomly to fix it, without notifying us tenants first- we had no idea they were coming. Many tenants have had to put their rent in escrow because that's the best way to get Beal to deal with your problems. There have also been a handful of tenants who have taken this man to court due to his poor behavior as a landlord. Beal's mother is a lawyer so he has no problem going to court if he needs to, even if he did something wrong. Don't rent from Stewart Beal, and if you already are, I suggest getting very aquainted with tenant rights and how escrow works. Know your rights.",1,2,2,1,2

165,BLUESTONE PROPERTIES,LONDON,ONTARIO,N6H 4P4,CA,"I lived in a Bluestone building in a student part of town for 2 years and my experience was awful. Issues started the month after I moved in including: the bathroom ceiling collapsed from a bathroom water leak upstairs and when they fixed it, the same thing happened again a few months later. Maintenance would just replace the ceiling tile or paint over the water stains without actually addressing the plumbing issues causing the leaks. There was a terrible cockroach infestation at the time that I lived there, particularly on the first floor where the indoor garbage dumpsters are located. The area flooded trash water and roaches into other tenants' units on the first floor. They also refused to address an ongoing bed bug infestation despite evidence of the bed bugs and this went up to Head Office. Bluestone may have some nicer buildings around town but it's very obvious which buildings they prioritize when it comes to cleanliness and maintenance. To their credit, the building manager and maintenance people were nice people but it felt like they couldn't do much. Bluestone's ""student"" buildings are poorly maintained and extremely overpriced likely because of the location. For example, a 350 sq. ft. unit in that building goes for $1299 which is not worth it at all in my experience.",1,1,4,4,2

Overall management does a good job creating a community feel, and I feel safe and happy here. They are also responsive to complaints and issues--for example, they recently installed an all new fire alarm system in my building and bright lights in the parking lots for added safety.

170,CARRIAGE HOUSE APARTMENT HOMES,SAVANNAH,GEORGIA,31406,US,"Carriage house apartments is an affordable option for people living in Savannah that cannot afford renting in the walkable areas. It is a family oriented complex that has lots of children living in it, and has good open space and playgrounds. It is near multiple good schools. The property was built in the 60’s, and is being slowly renovated. Moving in was easy, and many units have appliances like a fridge, washer and dryer, electric stove and oven, and a dishwasher. Due to it’s age, it’s plumbing and insulation is abysmal. The issues with insulation cause A/C units to need constant patching. Maintenance is obviously worked into the ground with how much they have to do. There is an extreme disconnect between property management and maintenance, and it takes a lot of hassle to get things fixed. And things need fixing a LOT. Everyone is kind and helpful when you can get a hold of them, though. Property management stays out of your business and is overall respectful of your space. They are very hands off. This is both a blessing and a curse. 
This complex and management are owned by RREAF Residential, their corporate practices are similar across all properties they own. The lease was solid and clear to read, and is easily accessible. It is also very reasonable besides some run of the mill extra fees. Multiple complexes in Savannah and across the country are owned by them, so be diligent. It can make it more difficult to rent here if you are flagged as a bad tenant.",2,3,5,5,4

This was while we were moving in. He was also disrespectful when I pointed out how many things were broken or disgusting in the place, telling me that I should have seen it before they did the improvements and not sending anyone out to try to fix any issues.

First week we moved in it was 90° and the air conditioner was broken for a week.

I moved out and they are still attempting to charge me for the month's rent from when I moved out.

No discount on rent whatsoever. No payment for a hotel whatsoever.  Didn't even put the apartment back together until I harassed them about it for two weeks and had to call all their bosses bosses.

And they made me foot the electric bill for all the drying equipment.

And then they gave me an illegal eviction notice after having one late rent payment in five years with five days to move out because they changed the rent payment system while I was out of the country, which they knew about, and never got a notice that it didn't work.

However, the basement suite is not a great place to be a tenant. Constantly, all day, you hear noise from footsteps, banging, slamming, dogs, you name it. Sometimes when they drop something it’s so loud it will scare you. Very thin floors. When people walk it almost sounds like stomping. We understand they have children and pets but there needs to be some respect for the people below. We have many videos of noise, on an almost daily basis there is loud noises from above. There have also been times they come downstairs without letting us know. Two times they thought no one was home and came downstairs without any call or message so they can go to their storage room. By-law this is not allowed and unacceptable even if we trust them in our rented area. Overall, the landlord is a very good person and is understanding of our needs and will help you whenever you have issues.

You'll wake up and a tree no one complained about has been cut down without so much as an email. You'll ask about the legally binding contract you signed to rent with them, and some clauses will simply be ignored because well, 'we don't feel like it.' But you need to stick to every letter of it? Can I paint the walls and make holes? ""Yes but we'll charge repairs unless you do it yourself"" ""How much is your repair cost?"" No clear answer. Sometimes low communication and a hands-off attitude is nice as a tenant: you can use the property as you see fit without someone breathing down your neck. Sometimes its rough: if something went really wrong would Greenleaf fix it? I genuinely couldn't say. How much will rent rise next year? Will it rise? Don't know. They fixed one issue I asked about no problem, then another they just...didn't. Where's the consistency? The maintainence? The communication? It's not a bad experience, but it's certainly not a good one, and I can't shake the feeling the exit costs will be very high.",3,3,1,5,4

Jan was very hands off, but would occasionally visit and invariably find things to complain about (e.g. rain gutters full of leaves, surprised that 'her guy' hadn't cleaned them. I never met said guy and paid out of pocket to have them cleaned). On moveout day, new tenants had already shown up waiting for keys before we had finished cleaning/leaving. Jan was late to this combined movein/moveout, complained about preexisting carpet wear and some marks on the walls (see lack of movein inspection), but I did end up getting my entire deposit back.

The usual response time for a repair request was a full month, whether it was something as simple as replacing batteries in an electronic lock or the heat not being on well into October. The only way we managed to get a prompt response out of him was by quoting specific bylaws or the tenancy act.

Got the apartment exterminator to come in 5 times and they often wouldn’t show so you have to harass them. They overcharge and will take out double the amount on accident. There is no parking. You will have your car broken into and/or get parking tickets. Homeless people will harass you. There is no security and it’s unsafe. Once a staff member got stabbed in the neck and needed reconstructive surgery trying to protect a woman was being sexually assaulted by a drug addict who snuck in. I accidentally stepped on blood in the elevator. There is dog poop everywhere, no one picks it up. The garbage room is always full. No hot water a lot of the time. The fire alarm goes off constantly and will wake you up in the middle of the night and go off for hours until the fire department gets there.

Elevators broke from December's for a good week. Then they had one elevator working for the next few months. I have a bad ankle due to an incident a few years back, and I often had to head to Farm Boy to be able to take an elevator down to my own parking.

Nice to have a list, not nice to have to do work you usually pay the landlord to do. We were asked to reset a sensor on our furnace to avoid an after-hours repair call but did not face repercussions from landlord for calling anyway as we would have increase carbon monoxide in the home.
The unit we were in was nice and updated, though not sound proofed as they referenced. 
On moving in they said they would be removing cleaning charges from the previous tenant's deposit to get the unit cleaned and yard work done but never sent anyone, I assume they will do the same when we leave. 
Property Manager tried to tell us that our move out inspection needed to happen before the end of the contract and the suite needed to be empty for the inspection.

230,SAL LOCASCIO,GAINESVILLE,FLORIDA,32613,US,"Repairs: He does the bare minimum to keep the property functioning. Our dryer broke four times, and instead of just replacing the dryer (which has to be from the 80s), he keeps doing temporary fixes. All of the outlets in the house are loose. One literally exploded. The hardwood floors are damaged, the walls have holes and nails, the windows are painted shut. The bathroom is disgusting. The water system in the house is so janky, if the washing machine is running then the shower will have no pressure. 

Health and Safety: We had a mold problem and he refused to call a contracted specialist to treat it. Again, an outlet exploded. The house is horribly insulted. As a fire hazard, he painted all of the windows shut and they can no longer be opened. 

Rental Stability: In Florida the landlord is required to offer a tenant to renew by a certain date before offering the lease to others. He didn't do this, so I literally had the lease signed out from under me again. 

Tenant Privacy: Literally just shows up whenever he wants without 24-hour prior notice to do random ""maintenance"", which is illegal in this state. One time he came to do maintenance on the bathroom and then I found tools of his left in my bedroom (I have no idea why he was in my room for that). 

Respect: Meeting him in-person, he was slow moving, impatient, and acted annoyed. Whether or not he'll text you back is anyone's guess. He picks a ""point man"" tenant (even though this isn't expressly decided in the lease) and pretty much only communicates through them.

231,SPEAR PROPERTIES LLC,WHITEWATER,WISCONSIN,53190,US,"The owner himself says his ""tactics"" come from ""books, podcasts, and other forms of self-education,"" which in a way speaks for itself considering how lazy and bumbling they've been since taking over these apartments. From my point of view repairs are shoddy and typically done by (i think) the owner's younger brother, who I've watched look up videos on how to do a repair. But when it comes to repairs, the icing on the cake was when the heaters in TWO buildings broke, my building's and the one next door. From my memory, they provided no timelines, poor communication, weren't willing to listen or be thorough when I told them I had no hot water or heat. Was told it was fixed, but came home to a 48 degree f apartment and still no hot water?? And my building was lucky that our heater was fixed within 10 days (over Christmas so naturally their family came first while tenants got screwed over), the building next to us had a broken heater for 6 weeks. It wasn't until they went to local news that something got done with any kind of urgency. The heater issue alone is awful, but when I moved in both my fire alarms where expired (11 and 13 yrs old) but they did nothing to fix that. They made me seem like the difficult one because I work and they refused to come down to let the maintenance men into my unit?? Another fun thing upon move in was the apartment smelling like cat piss, which they also did nothing to remedy.

Most of the issues are summed up with poor communication and not a shred of care for their tenants in my opinion. The prior owners were known as amazing landlords and deeply caring, flexible individuals. These people have come in with their self-taught bs from podcasts and completely botched the one of the few decent apartments in town left.

Above my son's room is the second apt. in this 2 unit home they renovated the kitchen last year. And like the poor craftsmen they are or hire they put down a wood floor instead of ceramic tile. They also clearly didn't use a red seal plumber as the sink sporadically leaks into my kids room. They sent a guy by to look at it and that's just what he did. He looked up at he ceiling and left. The 2nd water problem also comes from above. One evening when the tenant was upstairs having a bath one night water started pouring into my bathroom. I had to pull the drywall down from my ceiling. The next day they came and looked and couldn't find a problem by looking through the hole now occupying my bathroom ceiling. I clearly stated the problem was going to that the over flow on the tub wasn't connected to the drain and that would need to be tackled from upstairs not my unit. Ignored me completely and still haven't fixed the hole. Luckily I'm in construction so I'll be doing it. I charge $45/hr for my red seal work. They have never mowed the grass or shoveled or plowed the driveway. They lost against me at the LTB trying o classify my roommate as a subletter and they keep trying to tell me that my current roommate is also subletting but hey have no problem approving him. Prior to moving in a perspective roommate went behind my back and photoshopped some paperwork so they could get last month's rent.

I asked him to leave amd that this isn't going to happen.
Ever since he's been trying to evict me. In fact we've been to the LTB 5 times since and he's lost 4 times. The most recent time was my mistake but it's not eviction worthy. He tried again this May when he tried to hoodwinked me and tell me that he plans to move into the apt. himself. He and I both know this isn't true and he wants me out so he can jack up the rent for the next person. He has stopped doing any repairs on my unit amd I'm left to do them myself.

The property manager was very understanding during the one time I was late on rent and didn't charge me any late fees. They let me have my huge dog! Overall, I would say that I had a good experience here, but to go into the negatives:
The property manager was not consistently in the office during the posted office hours. They often closed up early for the day without notifying anyone, which sometimes meant that I had to try a few times to talk to them.
When I first moved into the apartment, the carpet was already not in good shape.
The AC unit we had leaked a lot of water and the property manager sent someone to try to fix it a couple of times but it didn't work. My AC unit leaked for most of the time I lived here so I kept a plastic bin under the AC unit to catch the condensation so it wouldn't soak the carpet. The wall AC unit is the only AC for the whole apartment, so in order to keep the bedroom cool (which was on the other side of the apartment from the AC unit) the AC had to be on full blast, causing the living room to be freezing.
When they replaced my broken stove, the new stove they got me was bigger than the old one and too big to fit both the refrigerator and the stove in the kitchen, so my refrigerator was in my living room for like 6 months.",3,3,5,5,5

Additionally, any problems we reported in the unit were not addressed until the end of our lease. For example, there was a leaking ceiling in the master bedroom, which was only painted over on the last day without proper care. To make matters worse, the landlord refused to return our key deposit, claiming we should have repainted the entire unit and hired professional cleaners. However, we had already cleaned the unit to the best of our ability and had not caused any damage. When we brought this up, the landlord yelled at us in Korean, making it impossible to communicate.

Once Fadi took over we all started getting extremely disrespectful and unprofessional email “reminders”, and he started doing mostly fixed term leases to avoid rent cap rules. I was lucky to have moved in before that so I have a year to year. However, every time our lease is renewed Fadi tries to trick us into signing a lease with an increase that is above the rent cap, and we have to carefully “correct” him in a way that feels like he won’t take it out on us. 
Earlier when he first took over the management of the building, he sent us all a list of “house rules” (literally that’s what the document was called) that told us a bunch of things we weren’t allowed to do (i.e. have a treadmill, smoke on the balconies/directly outside the building), many of them seeming like arbitrary rules to try to get people to move out and give up their renewing leases so he could skyrocket the price of the units. 
We had a pretty bad mouse problem for a couple of years but it seems to have gotten slightly better. Still a mice-heavy building though.

Took over a week for them just to clean the carpet and give them mold spray. 

The majority of repairs in my apartment I've done myself. Frequently I'd put in a service request then a week later receive an email that it was fixed, but it hasn't been. & sometimes the repairs are done incorrectly or they are watching a YouTube video on how to repair it. I don't knock YouTube, but if you are supposed to be a certified electrician, why would you need a YouTube video on replacing a fuse box?

Some of the office employees will try to become friends with you, then go around & ask you not to leave bad reviews because it will effect their bonuses. 
I have a do not enter my apartment notice unless I've given permission before hand for certain repairs. I have continuously had maintenance just walk into my apartment without knocking. Even when I don't have a maintenance request in. I bought another lock for the door to stop it from happening at this point. 
Took away assigned parking & parking lot snow removal, they never did the sidewalks. Ambulance, firetrucks & police have a hard time getting to us during the winter.

278,SB PROPERTIES,TUCSON,ARIZONA,85719,US,"The complex we stayed in was unfortunately often in violation of building codes--outside sewer pipe burst twice within a one-year lease. Both times it took several days (up to a week) to fix despite flooded sewage on tenant entryways. Consistent mouse infestation with no regular pest control. Central building swamp cooling is unevenly distributed between rooms, and oftentimes insufficient for summer heat waves. Laundry room often only had one working machine out of three washer-dryer combinations, and gate locks were sometimes swapped without written tenant notice nor even distribution of new keys. Some rooms are somewhat renovated, though their model apartment is far better than the one we got. We also had delays moving in despite already signing the lease, and our apartment room was switched due to the pressure of choosing between an infested room, a smaller but uninfested room, or homelessness for a week due to our move-in date being moved on the whim of management. The smaller room we moved into ended up being infested regardless. Management takes little to no action on any work orders but will always enter other tenants' apartments to evict and remove property in an extremely timely manner. Pool is perhaps maintained and cleaned once a week at best, sometimes neglected for weeks at a time. When we moved to legally break our lease due to building code violations, they never responded to our letters and we simply left without pursuit, which is extremely unprofessional on their end. This was even after we made sure to have a proper mailing address off-complex, since we had a lot of trouble establishing one on-complex.

The people at the front desk/security officers they hire are lovely and do their best to help you. They are probably underpaid, and should be paid much more.
Now the bad:
- Thin walls-- you can hear your neighbors being intimate/telling/screaming/talking. That's right. Talking.
- Strong weed smell, which has not been addressed
- Overall lack of privacy. Management comes at their leisure. Even if notice is given, they never specify a time, which is highly inappropriate.
- The public areas (i.e. Cafe) are not remotely clean, and the chairs in the study rooms are stained with mystery substances.
- Overall, the property has not been well managed. The cabinets were vile and dripping with old oil when we moved in. There's a fly painted over in one of the rooms, a booger from tenants' past in a bathroom, and I suspect the place was not properly cleaned before we moved in. 
- Shuttle's are provided and highly unreliable. I (and everyone I've spoken to thus far) has had to pay out of pocket for Ubers. Between me and my friends, we've probably spent over $1500 dollars on Uber because of the shuttle's unreliability. 
- Overall, it's overpriced for what you get. There are much better apartments (and better location-- this place is quite far from all three campuses. Roughly same driving time, but irritatingly far. I think it's even worse for those who take public transport) for the same price. For example, Axis 360 has a similar concept, but is much better managed (they don't have a shuttle to downtown Buffalo, but they have them for North and South Campus).",1,2,3,1,1

Short list of problems:
- Ceiling fan fell onto our bed where we sleep. In the middle of the day while no one was in the room. Thank goodness, it could have killed us. 
- Light fixture in kitchen just fell out of the ceiling one day. Took 2 days for a repair man to visit and fix.
- Faucet in bathroom almost exploded. They fixed the problem, but didn't replace the faucet, which actively corrodes pieces into everything. Our children have to touch the thing.
- Our very rusted out washer and dryer have destroyed most of our clothes due to the rust. They will not replace the washer and dryer. 
- Same washer and dryer apparently caught on fire internally and luckily didn't catch the house on fire. When maintenance found the problem, they replaced the wire, not the already very rusted unit.
- Downstairs unit had a flood. We are above that unit. They came upstairs to see if the pipe was ours (it wasnt) and undid the screws for the bath faucet. They came up and recaulked it, but never redid the screws. It regularly falls and every call they come and re-caulk it without fixing the problem.

I contacted corporate to discuss. I'd characterize their response as treating it as unreasonable to expect the sole elevator in the building to be dependable, ignored anything I said about the awfulness of the customer experience. If you move into the building we were in, there's a legit possibility the elevator won't work on your move in or out day, and you may be walking your furniture up or down 5 floors. It has happened, and I would not characterize management as being remotely sympathetic.

They proposed a 9% rent increase, if we renewed. My partner tried to negotiate with them. All efforts received no response. Bafflingly, our former unit (1 of 14! available units at the time of this post. The complex isn't that big!) has been listed at least $300 less per month + a month free discount, well below the total that any of the arrangements my partner offered them would've brought in revenue. This is the first instance I've seen of encouraging tenants to leave where rent was subsequently reduced (in prime rental season!), rather than increased. I don't know whether to suspect nefariousness or gross incompetence. But--as a review of a different outpost of this company suggests, Google their name + ""realpage"" or ""Trump"" or ""lawsuits.""

He must have connections with these contractors or getting something. No one in there right mind would hire these people. Rude, trash people items, leave a huge mess and does a horrible job.

장점은, 지하철 역과 가깝습니다. 바로 옆에 Islington JMS라는 학교가 있습니다. 조금 걸어가면, 한인마켓도 몇몇이 있습니다. 렌트비가 비교적 저렴합니다. 실내 수영장과, 피트니스 시설이 있습니다. 꽤 괜찮습니다.
단점은, 관리가 엉망이라는 거. 관리인이 열심히 관리를 하지 않습니다. 중앙 냉난방시설인데, 송풍구에 유리섬유 단열제를 쓴데다가 이게 낡아서 바스러집니다. 싹 걷어내고 페인트를 칠하면 좋을텐데... 열심히 필터를 교환해 가면서 쓰고 있는데, 불안합니다. 고속 엘리베이터 시스템인데, 이게 소프트웨어가 엉망이어서 가장 가까이에 있는 엘리베이터가 오는 것이 아니라, 움직이는 것 중에서 하나가 옵니다. 어쩔때는 5분 넘게 기다리기도 합니다.

My husband and I had an issue where our bathtub faucet was leaking scalding hot water for about a month which was not only a safety issue as it caused the rest of the water in the apartment to also be scalding hot but it also caused our PG&E bill to double and the quadruple in price before the hot water gave out completely. It took a full month to even get anyone in to look at the issue.

The handyman Tim, who was incredibly uncommunicative, tore a hole through our bathroom wall and left the water running in the pipe in the wall which caused water to leak into the units below ours. Then he just left the hole. It's been a full month and we've had no hot water and no working shower and no date as to when it will be repaired. We have also not been offered any break on rent or compensation for our electric bills.

Not to mention the myriad of other issues on the property that have not been fixed. The back wall of the building has been exposed and covered in plastic for months. Every time the handyman touches it our wifi goes out. Utterly unprofessional and ridiculous.",1,1,1,4,2

I Ellinson & Co manage our property in the Gosforth area; they are a small team who have an office on the estate that means they can respond to issues pretty quickly. For example, our downstairs neighbour flagged with us that water was leaking from our bathroom into theirs and causing water damage on the ceiling. Within an hour of emailing, one of the maintenance team we've become familiar with was round and applied to new caulking to the edge of the bath. Issue resolved. Some other issues they're not so swift with; our fence was blown away over a year ago by Storm Arwen and it took a year of back and forth before we finally had to organise the repairs ourselves and get the landlord (not I Ellinson) to foot the bill. The process was not the greatest and I wish we'd been told from the start that we could investigate this.
Otherwise, the flat was functionally sound and we've lived here for a few years now. Some things aren't ideal, like the back door let's in a heck of a draft and the kitchen ventilation fan makes a right racket in high winds. We've just never investigated with them whether it's something we can resolve. The tenancy also lets us keep a cat which is nice as we moved in with one.

There's no communication from their office whatsoever to solve problems even though they have all of our contact information. Things that could be easily resolved with a single phone call are never touched on. 
It often feels like they WANT things to be as difficult as possible to extract as many fees as possible. 
That's not even getting into the safety issues. When I first moved in there were no locks on the main building and I regularly saw vagrants clogging the hallways and stairwells. Disruptive people would go wandering through the building at 3am, screaming and banging on doors.

305,HORIZON AT INDIAN RIVER,CHESAPEAKE,VIRGINIA,23325,US,"For the most part, an okay place. The biggest issue was health and safety.

Guess technically that wasn't something they could do much about, but it made it a health hazard to stay. I feel like something could have been done to make that situation better. 

Another issue was the centipedes. Those suckers would chill on our ceiling and we'd have to get rid of them on our own.

This is more of a warning to other people though that the neighborhood was rather unsafe. There were gunshots, drug deals going on, one guy nearly busted open our upstair's neighbor's door down because he was upset about a drug deal or something.

Long story short, we asked what we had to do to get out of our lease a month early as we bought a house. They told us we would have to find new tenants to take over. So we did showings and found new tenants and they signed the lease. 

After we moved out and had to spend hundreds of dollars on a cleaner as we were expected to have the unit move in ready including professional carpet cleaning and a new furnace filter (all mandatory by hangingstone). 
We were then told we wouldn’t get our $2150 security deposit back as we broke our lease a month early. 

I contacted RTDRS and they said we were entitled to our deposit because someone else took over the lease. We had to wait 3 months for a hearing over the phone. Which the court ordered them to pay us our deposit. And we are waiting to receive it this week hopefully. 

Jacqueline is the manager and was extremely disrespectful during this experience and very hard to communicate with. I’ve rented for years and  have never experienced anything like it.

316,JIM PAPAS,NEW YORK,NEW YORK,11385,US,"Everything is bad here, landlord doesn't care if something breaks, he'll get to it when he gets to it, IF he gets to it. If you ask nicely or not... Rent though? The same rules don't apply, of course.

Why do I have to ask more than once when I'm paying an absurd, inflated price for a place with absolutely 0 amenities? 

So about the units, it's an old prewar so railroad galore, if you don't mind that OK, but know the walls are paper thin; you will hear any noisy neighbors.  So thin, in-fact, I can hear snoring from the unit next door on a regular nightly basis.

Water pressure is laughable at best, I tried specialized shower heads designed and intended for very low water pressure, they all failed. Or rather, the water pressure was so low they couldn't do much help.

There are literal exposed walls, huge open spaces welcoming any and all unwanted pests who want to be a part of your family. (besides the very real problem of pests now invading your space, these exposed areas also allow all the drafty air you just love come winter time in the NE... Because who doesn't love to wonder how the apartment is still cold when the heaters are at full blast and all your windows are closed)  It's the welcome mat for NYC's most beloved pets (mice, roaches, unidentified biting bugs) of course.  Tell the landlord? Tell the live-in ""super""?  Doesn't matter, no one cares! It won't get fixed. Fuck you, just pay your ridiculous rent and like it!

About the live-in ""superintendent"" you may be thinking to yourself, that's a plus right? Something breaks, or goes wrong? Well, he's only a knock away or simple call. Whatever happens can be fixed, right? WRONG you fool. He certainly gets the live-in part but seems confused about the ""super"" aspect of his being able to live rent-free part of the bargain. Does he clean the halls or do any regular upkeep of the common areas? NOPE

Does he fix anything when it breaks? NOPE!
Actually, usually he'll just tell you to tell the landlord w/ snarky attitude. So you stand there confused, because... Why are you the super? And why do I have to tell dad when I just told mom? Why is it any more complicated than problem>report>fix? If you love to be frustrated and overpay for your living space, this is just the place for you!

In the miraculous event that the ""super"" remembers his title and actually attempts to fix something you report is broken without the unusual extra steps, be prepared to be disappointed! Unsure how this douche got to be super of anything, but it's obvious he has 0 idea about most if not all repair. You'll either hire a professional after his crack job or if you're handy and able, do it yourself! Because again, you OVER PAY for this apartment. Why shouldn't you do the work Tweedledee and Tweedledum are too lazy to do in the first place.

OH, here's one of his better attributes! Apparently it's in his ""super"" job requirement to burn trash and/or bird feces on an almost daily basis. Maybe you too hate the environment, cool, but do you also love the taste and smell of burning trash in the morning? Do you love the taste of Colgate and animal waste in your mouth as you brush? Well, shockingly, this IS the place for you, you damn psychopath!

Still reading? Oh boy seems reality finally hit this scumbag in the mouth and knocked his noggin back into place, it means he actually finally lowered the price to a more normal range for a railroad, zero amenity, prewar building in Ridgewood!

If that's the case, you should know, when there's a gas leak, and you smell it for 3 days unsure of yourself or if it's in fact actually a gas leak, you finally call the gas company/ emergency services (literally what you're told to do) because you finally realize it wasn't your nose playing tricks on you. Proceed to make a courtesy call to scummy Jim to let him know what's up.  Jimmy gets mad at you because ""you didn't call me first"" sure I'll call Mr. Reliable in the very real event of an emergency because that always goes so well. /s

Now, let's get to summer in this palace... The four seasons of apartments, according to Jim, I'd wager.

Well it's a railroad apartment, built in the 30s where AC units weren't a normal commodity and somehow windows were offensive to 1930s design and apparently not a good way to combat heat. No actual idea, but little to no windows in this place, so getting intended draft requires you to leave every single door open and all windows open (roommates look elsewhere) which maybe isn't a problem for you if you enjoy the smell of burning trash and literally breathing in toxic fumes on a weekly basis.

So you think now, an AC will do, sure if you can get it to run and not kick your entire apartment's breakers off.  Now you're thinking, I'm not dumb, I can reset the breakers.... Ha! You'd think for the absurd price at the least a breaker box is included in the unit. NOPE! Who you gotta call? Dumbass “super” good luck if he's home.  He's not; picture this:  you just bought $400+ in groceries to save up for the month. Haha, good way to waste more money. The breaker will be looked at anywhere from 2-6hrs from when you contacted either of them. Scummy Jimmy? He won't care. Just wants rent.

Took literally a year to get Jim the slum to address the electrical wiring to some degree, I noticed a simple coffee machine and microwave (running simultaneously)  would kick the breakers when we moved in. It wasn't summer then, but I knew I'd need a big AC to cool the open railroad styled space come summer, so I preemptively told him to fix the wiring or electrical, knowing it would become a problem come summertime. Did it get fixed when I asked? Did he even bother to come check what the problem was? ABSOLUTELY NOT! He waited till I was irate and calling them on a literal multiple daily basis to turn the breakers back on in the middle of heatwaves. To eventually do anything about it, and even that took months to get done. But not before losing hundreds in spoiled groceries and damaging computer components because of old faulty wiring!

If you're STILL reading, you're not the brightest bulb in the toolbox, and why are you in a toolbox anyway? If still considering renting, from him, you probably deserve the bad experiences you will no doubt suffer after you sign that lease with whatever garbage con realtor Jimmy uses because he knows you'd never rent from him directly. Good luck, you played yourself.",1,1,3,2,2
317,DMI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,MISSISSAUGA,ONTARIO,L4W 2X9,CA,"We were infested with cockroaches for EIGHT MONTHS while they repeatedly got the world's worst exterminators in to spray. They wouldn't engage in anything more involved like sealing up potential pathways into our apartment. The whole building was crawling with bugs - we lived on the 12th floor and saw them in the halls, but also in the laundry room in the BASEMENT. When we wrote them to request that they bring in different exterminators because we were entitled to a vermin free environment, they accused us of intimidation and said the problem was that we weren't keeping our apartment clean enough. At that point we were keeping all of our perishable food and goods in tupperware containers inside the cupboards to try to keep the cockroaches away, so cleanliness wasn't an issue. It also wouldn't explain how our apartment was so dirty that it led to cockroaches in the BASEMENT. They tried to convince us that keeping the apartment vermin free was our responsibility, which is a lie. We eventually paid four hundred dollars to get our own exterminators in, and my husband sealed up all the pipes and anywhere the bugs might be getting in. Amazingly, the problem immediately went away.

Since we moved in they have filled in the pool, torn down the kid's playground, and turned the tennis court into a parking lot. One elevator has been on service for two and a half years. We have fewer and worse amenities than we did when we moved in...but somehow our rent keeps going up.

They have pretty much monopolized the greater Bangor area so you most likely will have to rent from them so this is a heads up to know what you’re getting into and avoid them if you can.

325,"ADEDAYO ""DAYO"" BADEJO",STOWMARKET,ENGLAND,IP14 1HD,GB,"""Dayo"", the landlord, lived in another city, hours away. He would cut the grass once a year and once or twice he came around to check up on things, so in the few years I was living in this place I only saw him maybe 3-4 times total. It was nice that he didn't bother us (he owns all 3 flats in my building), but I think because he lived so far away it was easy for him to neglect the place. The middle and lower flat had their kitchens recently redone, but the middle flat had drawers and cabinets that opened into one another so you would have to completely shut one set of drawers if you wanted to open an opposing cabinet. The upper flat had one of it's cabinets literally fall off the wall and land on the counter. The person who lived there had small children as well, and all I can think is what if it would have landed on one of them, or their hands/fingers if they were in the kitchen when it fell? In the lower flat the boiler went out in the middle of winter and the person who lived there had to go two weeks without heating or hot water before it was fixed. A few of the windows had been opened too far and the hinges were bent so that the window wouldn't properly close all the way again, so cold air was always getting in. I couldn't bend them back so I ended up using sealing tape on it. The whole place was infected with black mold and I was constantly battling it around the windows. I didn't realise it grew under the lino in the bathroom since the floor always felt a little ""mushy"" in there. When I told Dayo that I was moving out (a month in advance) he tried to bully me into staying, saying that because I had just resigned the lease (because it was going to legally go out of date, I had already stayed there years/well past the minimum amount of time on the original contract) I wasn't allowed to break the lease.

333,"NEWPORT VILLAGE APARTMENTS, MANAGED BY AVENUE5 RESIDENTIAL",NORTH LAS VEGAS,NEVADA,89113,US,"Avenue5 Residential, previously sued in Seattle for a rent fixing scheme, manages Newport Village Apartments in North Las Vegas. They knowingly rented me, a pregnant woman, a roach infested apartment. I informed Newport of the roach infestation on 4/19, which is the day after I signed my lease. I found over 30 roaches dead and alive in under 6 days. They have only offered to do a general spraying. When I contacted their pest control vendor, SMART Pest Solutions, I was informed that general spraying is not how they treat infestations; they use a different set of chemicals and treatments.

As a pregnant woman, I cannot be around roaches or the chemicals used to eradicate them, as it could be fatal to my growing child and negatively impact his development. I informed Newport & Avenue5 of this on 4/24. I decided to talk to some of my neighbors and found that 3 other units in my building have varying roach quantities that they see on a regular basis and that it’s been ongoing for at least a year. I have not been able to live in the apartment because of the roaches, but I still check on it to see if the roaches are still a problem (well beyond 30 at this point) and to ensure no one has broken in.

On 5/6, I decided to do another check up only to find out that Newport had changed my locks, despite that I paid rent on 5/1. I went to the office and they offered to have a maintenance man let me into the apartment that I pay rent for, but did not offer to give me a new key. To this day, I have not heard from anyone regarding the health and safety of me and my loved ones nor have I been released from my lease.

Started having serious problems when we moved out at the end of our lease. We left the house in immaculate condition. Thankfully we had taken move in and move out pictures. They tried to withhold half our deposit for cleaning services that we had already had done and provided them receipts for. When we complained about this and requested a full refund of our deposit , they just ignored us.

In such an event, they would consistently keep us updated with timing of entry and exit, and generally were available and responsive with any communication.

Trash and trash bags scattered parking lot and hallways, over-flowing dumpsters, tenants cats “accidentally” roaming hallways, heavy + obvious drug use and police presence became the norm. 

Indoor/outdoor ”hallway” cats caused a flea infestation, resulting in pest control paid by tenants and threatening eviction to the persons who reported it.

On a positive, the original maintenance man was generally timely, and fixed things as best as he could. The second maintenance man was an idiot. If an appliance needed replacing, Care Taker made sure it was done within a few days, if not a week. Laundry machines work well, Care Taker would give out free drying cycles here and there. The parking lots were always plowed within 12hrs of snowfall. 

Rent is at the point where two incomes are needed, unless an individual has a high paying job. Steadily increased 2-3% each year until this last year, where it went up 8%. Garage spaces are available in a first come, first service basis for an extra charge.

It's indentured servitude with tax benefits for the employer.

Rent is raised as much as possible every chance they get. This company owns a large majority of rentals in Arcata, so your chances of getting them as a landlord are very high. The owner is know to have done renovations without permits, violated environmental laws and funded ""grassroots"" aka astroturf organizations to oppose developments done by their competition.

They do eventually respond to maintenance requests, but they prefer to argue with you and talk down to you first, before actually sending a request to the owner so that it can get done. When negotiating the lease I asked that the landlord provide a mower for the large yard, as every house I'd rented previously there was a mower on site when I moved in but I noticed in the walkthrough that there were no maintenance tools of any kind. This turned into a 13 email exchange where they basically said I was lying that that was my previous experience because NO owner would ever do that. They finally asked the actually owner and the owner offered to hire a landscaping company (more expensive than supplying a mower but I'll take it) and this was written into our lease. Fast forward to this spring (we moved in in October) and the grass is very long so I put in a maintenance request asking when the landscapers will start and how often they'll be coming. Instead of reviewing our lease or email history, I am once again attacked and gaslighted as being unreasonable because that' NOT SOMETHING OWNERS DO according to them, so I send them the relevant sections of the lease and a copy of our previous emails, and they agree to book the landscapers (no apology for being unnecessarily rude though).
This is just the latest in a long string of similar interactions. The hood fan was missing when we moved in, I noted it during the inspection and asked if it would be installed soon and was told it would be, it was noted as such on the move in report.

Problems:
- Roaches (just an absurd amount to the point where they're seen at all hours, everywhere)
- Sewage backup which flooded the entire bathroom, spare closet, and got under walls. This happened two to three times just in the six months I lived there.
- Constant standing water in walkways. This created muggy conditions year round, probably contributed to the sewage/bug problem.
- Despondent office management, because they're managing a mess.
- The pool was broken for months. Honestly I wouldn't have used it, again, this place has huge drainage issues.

Continuing problems:
- After our lease was up, we went month to month, paid the final month and then left. We still got charged with some bogus charge which they immediately send to collections without even giving us a phone call to explain the charge (it wasn't our rent amount, so a completely arbitrary number they decided to make up).

Your water is not included in the rent. You're charged an amount that can vary month to month so if water expenses were higher in the last period, your rent goes up. They run the sprinklers multiple times a day to try and keep grass around the community; the money spent on this water is included in your rent. The flexible expense alone can cost about 140$ currently, so be aware of this before renting.

REPAIRS:
Repairs can be slow and take several months depending on the issue.

LAUNDRY:
You're charged money to use the washing machines & dryers using a special card (no cash or personal cards); there are no in-unit hookups to my knowledge. The only way you can add money to this laundry card is by visiting the office with certain bills of cash; it does not take card.

PETS:
There are no listed pet size restrictions but there is a limit of 2 pets per apartment. (I was able to keep my enclosed pets like lizards without affecting this limit.)

PARKING:
Covered parking is available, but limited; you must pay for it and it's possible for residents to own two covered spaces even if they only have one vehicle.

PESTS:
They have existed, but I haven't seen very many in the last few years.",1,2,1,3,3

We ended up moving because of that, but in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't unreasonable, we just decided to weight rent at an apartment complex vs a townhome.  Carol helped us in a jam a few times with a roommate.
The only thing of note that was concerning was that they converted a duplex into a quad, so the basement unit had people.  It wasn't a bad thing except when the tenants that were there just unilaterally decided to turn off the AC since the control was downstairs.  80ish degrees in your house can suck in Colorado summer.  It would seem that it would be more economical and equitable to have two separate AC units, but what are you gonna do?  Landlords gonna landlord, even the good ones.

417,SHEUE (SHARON) LEE,ROYAL OAK,MICHIGAN,48073,US,"They keep security cameras that currently monitor the front of the house but they used to monitor the inside of the house and the living room. This, they claimed, was to watch for intruders but it was actually to enforce their ""only 2 visitors per month"" rule. When I first moved in I got my hair cut and had 2 of my siblings over and the landlord emailed me a bill for going over the 2 visitors per month rule, apparently being unable to recognize their own tenant with shorter hair. By the way, they did not tell me about the 2 visitors per month rule until I was at the house reading over the lease to sign it. God, this place was a nightmare. They will nickel and dime you for every tiny piece of damage, including regular wear and tear of the house, unless you can provide proof that you didn't do the damage. I had to pay $50 to replace their shower head from the 90s when it broke because I couldn't prove that I specifically didn't break it. There is no dumpster on this cul de sac, only a piece of the sidewalk that everyone piles their trash onto on garbage day. If you put your trash out before 6pm the night before garbage day they will fine you. There is nowhere to put your trash if you fill a bag before garbage day. and rest assured, with that security camera watching you come into and out of the house, they will always know if you do something they don't want you to. Yeah, this place is not good. It's like being spied on constantly. But more than that, the spying has made the house feel completely dead. No one spends any time in the living room or common areas in an effort to avoid the cameras. No one has anyone over so as to avoid the visitor fee.

-Walls are thick
-Front desk people are kind

Cons: 
-The gym that comes as part of our rental is a joke, very poorly maintained. None of the ellipticals work, and about half the medicine balls are falling apart. 
-The renovations they did were clearly on the cheap end-- the whole place wreaks of 'landlord special'. Think actual metal clothes hanger rods painted with latex paint, as well as the metal staircase
-When they were doing maintenance on the decks, repairmen didn't come when specified. Additionally, they did maintenance on the deck right below my unit, and I received zero notice of this-- it was quite disruptive as I work from home. I asked the staff to forward a request to give me notice if the deck right below mine would be worked on again, but they didn't comply with this request
-They raised the rent by over $200 on our unit to renew our lease. Needless to say, I won't be staying. My apartment is now the same cost per month as renting a 2-br house in this town. Expect your rent to increase next year if you start a lease here.

Possibly to scare off would be burglars? I'm not sure, but when asked to cease playing this awful music so loud you couldn't sit in peace in any of the downstairs spaces, they responded by turning the music up. 
The heating and hot water failed in the winter and they refused to send someone to fix it. Citing that it would be too expensive at this time of year and to wait.
Every bedroom was riddled with black mould, myself and other housemates got quite sick. We were also told the black mould was our responsibility. Which is just plain incorrect, it is always the landlords responsibility. 
They would hound us constantly about guests and even threatened to report us to police if we had too many over at once. 
One time during a scheduled PAT testing check, all my housemates were out and I was supposed to be except my work got cancelled for the day, so I was at home on the sofa drawing. The sofa faced the kitchen and the front door. As I was sitting there waiting for the man to finish his testing, the landlord walked in to the kitchen and started looking around in all the cupboards and drawers, inspecting the pile of washing up we were going to tackle that evening. Then when she turned around and saw me she shouted at me for not being out when they expected me to be. I apologised and said my plans changed but she shouldn't be in here anyway as she hadn't given notice. She told me she could enter HER property anytime she liked.

I am guessing she did as i never heard a peep after!!
I have NEVER had anyone stick up for me before, my last place i moved from the neighbours had no consideration for others and was a nightmare!!!

When i went on holiday/back home for 6 weeks, i asked her if she could give me spare keys for a friend so that they could water my plants and she did!!- I did give her them back when i returned.
 She was also ok with me putting up security camera's (internal and external)!! ie a ring door camera
She even gave me paint when i was leaving so that i didn't have to buy any and could get my deposit back!

She cared!! she looked after the building! the ice and snow always taken care of! when i noted that i think people are stealing mail, she put up new locks, changed the door to key entry only!!

Doesn't bug you about your pets subletting or ask for anything illegal like a deposit is good that way. Is responsive but is also a liar about how he's going to fix things.  It's kind of a mixed bag. He keeps the main building fire alarms in good repair. But he's definitely guilty of the landlord specials and just painting over issues. Downsized our fridge when our other one broke.,2,1,5,5,3

When we first moved in, our apartment did not have a coax outlet; no internet unless we got one. We had to fight the landlord to be able to do that. The apartment is supposed to have a crawl space for repairs, but it got carpeted over. Any repairs that are not easily accessible are just, impossible now? They also increased the rent the legal maximum this year, which was hundreds of dollars. They don't respond to any issues unless we kick up a huge fuss.

Promises were made about it getting professionally done that never went anywhere. A bathtub hose leak in the upstairs bathtub was never repaired (we were just told ""not to use"" the hose), and left water damage on the main floor ceiling that left one wondering if the ceiling might collapse. Tried to raise the rent above the LTA recommended maximum after a year, I pointed out that required a separate form and that a rent raise at all required written notice (the rent was never raised). We were N12 evicted, as far as I know the father still lives there. I don't think this was a case of being unhappy with our asserting our rights as tenants, I think we were interim tenants and the suite we were renting was always intended for family use.

Brings in a handyman to complete repairs in fairly good time, and has replaced appliances without too much complaint or question. Put the landscape care and snow removal on tenant-side -- again, this is not the tenant's responsibility in Ontario -- but I didn't make a big deal of that since I wanted to garden in the yard anyways.

The maintenance team was great - we had the ceiling in the bathroom cave in and both our fridge and oven stopped working while we were there. Everything was taken care of quickly and they gave us a temporary fridge while they were ordering a new one for us!
The rent increases were very reasonable during our time there (about $15/month increase in general), although this might have changed: before we moved out they were implementing a monthly water fee which seems like a dangerous charge.",5,5,5,5,5

I will not get into specifics to avoid revealing my identity but Alex Perlman will use every trick in the book to circumvent the Residential Tenant Act as much as possible and gaslight you as the tenant to being the one who is unreasonable, demanding and the one who has expectations that are at a level of luxury not basics for health, safety and wellbeing.

Him and his agent (*********) will sell and rent the units he owns under a ""promotion"" of 9 months of rent with 3 months free when its truly a method to go around rent control and to ensure that he can raise the rent at a higher percentage than the legally allowed on a 12 month lease while also ensuring that your experience is so terrible that you end up wanting to leave so that you cannot maintain the rent you signed at the beginning. At most, he likes you to stay for 2 years.

He will over look, smells, infestation, noise complaints, privacy complaints and tell you you're bothering him and hang up on you anytime he doesn't like what you have to say.

I would also suggest he targets vulnerable people such as students, single women, new immigrants who cannot speak English well and other low income folks so he has the upper hand.

478,LAKEWOOD LODGE,HANAHAN,SOUTH CAROLINA,29410,US,"My husband and I lived happily in this complex for several years. Our unit wasn't anything fancy. It was clean and attractive enough, with some details that were funky (tiny, oddly shaped kitchen,) sloppy (door hinges rusty and caked with generations of whitewash,) or out of date (no ventilation in the bathrooms, somewhat rickety single glazed windows.)
The location was great, right by the reservoir among trees and pleasant landscaping, quiet and no thru traffic, conveniently placed to plenty of shopping and restaurants. No excess noise from neighbors, free frequent pest control (a must in this part of the south,) and maintenance was great at addressing major issues to satisfaction quickly. Our rent rose in line with inflation, so the apartment remained fairly affordable.
Then we received word from the complex's new ownership that our rent would be rising over 30% with only a month's notice. $300 - $400 depending on renewal term. This was without any modernizations or new services, of course.
The rent hike was shocking, but maybe we should have seen it coming. In the time leading up to the it, we'd seen little changes here and there that seemed ominous. Communications from management had gradually shifted tone from addressing us residents as valued neighbors (""Come join us such and such date for a pool party with snacks!"" that kind of thing...) to scum who couldn't be trusted to take care of their property and behave themselves and needed a firm hand and threats of fines. We were also required by the new ownership to pay for insurance and utilities that used to be included.

482,TRI CITY APARTMENT RENTALS,BINGHAMTON,NEW YORK,13905,US,"While renting from them they gutted our upstairs shower which was a safety hazard to us as tenants. They left this shower gutted for months with insulation falling from the walls of it, if anyone (or animal) stepped in it we would have fallen through. This left us with a downstairs shower that had cracks in the flooring to which they tried to fix with flex seal (it didn't work). The water from the shower leaked into our basement which caused mold to form in our sons room,  which was located in the basement, as well as mushrooms forming in that shower due to all the moisture from leaks.
We told landlords of pipes freezing during winter and they did nothing until eventually the pipes burst and water flooded our basement. They never came to clean up the water (we had a family member do it) they came to fix the pipe which left the ceiling exposed with insulation. They came to replace the carpet by putting a ""new"" carpet over the one that had water damage. We eventually had mold all over the basement from the water damage and the leaking from the upstairs bathroom which they never tried to fix. We had to make our son sleep in the living room and most of his possessions were destroyed by black mold.
The landlord from the property physically threatened my partner and myself after we withheld rent for these issues to be fixed. 
When we finally started to move out due to nothing being fixed they allowed their maintenance people into our house where they decided to steal our personal property from us, including a $500 metal detector and a brand new microwave gifted to us when we moved in.

The apartment is maintained decently for the most part, the parking lot gets plowed in the winter and lawns mowed in the summer. The washer/dryer have broken down a couple times but they've gotten fixed eventually, my biggest beef though is that there is no air conditioning even though we pay for electricity. It gets hot as balls in the summer and although we could buy and install a window unit, our windows slide open horizontally so the aircon we use has to be adapted. Other than that, it's a pretty nice place to live and we get a relative amount of freedom in decorating. The property manager seems to be a little flighty but if you're persistent she'll get back to you eventually. Also there's no way to automate rent payments, you have to mail a check every month. There's a balcony and a sizable kitchen and an overhang to park your car under so brushing your car off during the winter is not an issue.

That's not how apartments work! This third roommate also was under the impression she was going to be living in a unit with her friend, who instead got assigned another unit in the same building. They also assigned us bedrooms within the unit, which they hadn't done the previous year, and decided over the summer while we were both out of town that we'd have to move all our stuff from the bedrooms we'd been using into the assigned ones or all our stuff would be thrown out. They didn't inform us about this by email or phone, but rather a notice taped to our front door that neither of us would've seen (because we were both at home for the summer) if I hadn't happened to be in town for another reason one day. Maintenance never responds to requests (we had a broken freezer for 4+ months). They told us to move all our stuff out of our rooms so they could redo the carpets, then they didn't redo the carpets for another 2 months while we just had to live with empty rooms.

Carpets are not installed properly,  outlet covers are coming off the walls, nobody cleaned my apartment before I moved in, and in the summer my apartment becomes infested with fruit flies and scuttle flies that come in via my bathroom drains.

Several problems needed to be fixed several times before the solution finally stuck. 

Neighbors can be friendly, but mostly everyone keeps to themselves. Kids not living in the complex will randomly appear to hang out on the stoops and walk through the parking lot, destination unknown. Some younger kids will play in the parking lot around your car, so be aware of that. I don't believe management has said anything about this, for we've received no email or correspondence. But leave your pet's poop out and we'll get several emails about it, as well as trash overflow.

Management will also not let you know in advance any updates to the apartment. We received a new alarm system with probably about a week's notice, and no notice on removing the locking doorknob on our outer door, to which I was told ""you have the passcode entry lock, that should be enough."" However, necessary updates you'll have to fight for, like a new range when yours goes out.

It seemed that they thought we put rice down the drain which wasn't the case; it actually was just permanently broken and there was no effort to fix it long term.

Others he responded to quickly. Not sure what the difference was as it went to the same email. Poor communication in general, he never responded to the phone number he gave me. He also tacked on a fees for moving out early that weren't in the lease. I do not know if this is a result of being a sketchy person or being bad at writing a lease. The building itself was kind of gross. The dishwasher had black mold in it when I moved in, he did replace the grates though when asked. The carpet was nasty and old and needs to be replaced. Had some kind of mystery orange stain on large swaths of it that I used half a bottle of carpet cleaner to remove, yet he stipulates in the lease that you'll be paying for carpet cleaning regardless of what you do. It's hard to be motivated to clean when you move out when you know you're getting docked on the security deposit regardless. There were birds that had ripped holes in the roof overhang and they shit all over the balcony and ripped up my plants. I mentioned the birds in several emails that were ignored until it came time to renew the lease and he said he'd get rid of them but never did or never succeeded in doing so. The apartment had a stink bug infestation as well. Living in the apartment was very expensive as he does not cover any utilites at all, and he raised the rent. He also told me he was raising the rent without giving me 30 days notice, and to compensate he gave me an extra 30 days on the old rate. Naturally, this was after most of the rentals in the area were taken so I couldn't find an affordable place for me to move out (mid august instead of july in a college town).

He also charged me 800$ for taking my own 100$ ladder with me when I Moved. I always paid my rent in time and he used that as a way to make racist classist jokes about other tenants not paying theirs.

All water sources on the property including the pool had a strange and unpleasant odor not typical of other properties in the region. But when the AC broke they did install a new one promptly and without complaint or expense.

Rent for a 1-bedroom started at $1,150 a month, which does not include parking costs, storage costs, or, of course, laundry. Rent has been raised twice in two years, and is now over $1,200 for a 1-bedroom with no parking, no storage, and no laundry.
Parking is another $90-$120 per month.
No explanation given beyond ""property costs are going up"" to explain the rent increases, and comments re-stating that it is not due to any repairs being made as they have no intention to do so at this time.
Building is supposed to be smoke-free, but constantly reeks of marijuana and the only consequence is an email reminding people it's a non-smoking building.
Building is surrounded by a fence with a lock- lock is broken/missing on one of two gates, and the fence is missing entire sections, leaving it open and the gates superfluous.

After maintenance came and confirmed that there was indeed mold (they gave a specific list of places where there was mold, including in the bathroom and in pretty much all the windows), it took them months to actually get anything done and when they finally did they sent one guy with a container of expired cleaner. The mold issue was never dealt with and the person with a mold allergy ended up having to move out. In addition, there was a leak in the ceiling of the first floor under the toilet on the second floor, which caused the plaster ceiling to lose structural integrity and fall onto the floor. The first time this happened we were told that it was fixed, only to one day come home to the ceiling having fallen apart again, clearly not actually having been fixed. Someone came to fix it and when he cut open that portion of the ceiling, the exposed wood beam was visibly moldy, and he just screwed another plank to it and sealed the hole back up with drywall putty.

Those are just a few luxuries you will experience living in this apartment complex. This landlord company is family owned by an elderly couple and their son. They stalk the property daily like they are running a mob, and will serve you eviction papers immediately if the rent is late even one day, yet still somehow nothing ever gets repaired. They will go out of their way to fine you if you throw something away incorrectly but can't even be bothered to take care of any of the maintenance issues. Whether you live on the first floor or the third one, there is no end to the elements. In the winter its freezing, in the summer its sweltering hot. There is no insulation and the wind blows right through all the windows. When it rains water leaks through the front balcony door and from the ceiling. In one building there is an apartment with a giant gaping hole in the ceiling with huge pieces of drywall falling out, waiting to cave in and squish the tenants at any moment. After multiple requests over several years they have since given up on expecting it to be repaired (I guess they don't pay enough in rent for the safety of their family to matter to these people). Across the hall from that, an apartment that was burned in a fire a few months ago stands untouched, the black cobwebs still lining the ceiling of the hall as a reminder. If you are looking for a new drug dealer, the tenants on floor 1 are very proficient with their meth making skills. The fumes permeate the building from basement to roof for several hours every single day, yet still they somehow can't seem to figure out who is doing it. The property is riddled with cock roaches and mice. I have personally seen the giant flying kind in the basement.

They do regularly send out people to change air filters and spray for bugs, so that is nice. They were a bit late in giving us a fire extinguisher, but we got one eventually.",1,4,1,3,3

546,BJB PROPERTIES,CHICAGO,ILLINOIS,60657,US,"Very tiny studio apartment that I chose bexause of excellent location and clean, modern look. I lived there for 2 years on and off since I travelled often for work.

Good:
- apartment was clean and easy to keep clean
- rats living in a hole right outside our ground floor apartment but never rats inside our apartment
- maintence man was very nice and responsive and quick and competant. Big guy but i always felt safe alone with him in that tiny apartment as a young woman
- nice online portal for paying rent and making maintenance requests
- offered social events for tenants

Bad
- high tech door lock never worked right on our door. There was a trick to getting it to lock after us that other doors didnt have. Had to figure that out on our own
- in unit ac/heat unit never worked properly. They would come often very quickly to fix it but it kept breaking
- so many units lost heat once for a long enough stretch of time in the dead of winter that the poor maintenance guy had to cycle space heaters between rooms because he didn't have enough for everyone. Very cold. Would have been dangerous if we were not young and healthy.
- space heaters were less energy efficient than the in unit heat so our bills would spike whenever our heat broke
- ground floor apartment came with it's own serial masturbator at the window. He was the explicit reason the previous tenant moved up a few floors. We were told upon moving in that she just wanted a bigger place. She said it was 100 percent the guy who would watch her sleeping and masturbate. Very dangerous. Had to find out about him the hard way.
- had to pull rank with other tenants to get them to even email people in affected apartments about the stalker. The email was so vague that it called the act 'relieving himself' which is innaccurate. 
- social events were largely attended by building staff (management not cleaners or maintenance or anyone with a real job) and barely anyone else. Great opportnity for them to eat and drink for free",2,2,5,5,3

- it was simple to sign a lease with many friends
- place was kept clean, comfortable and safe minus exceptions under 'bad'
- regular cleaning service for shared rooms like bathrooms was nice
- they never cared that we all had our girlfriends basically also living there

Bad:
- landlord himself was never reachable once in 3 years. Always on vacation out of country
- management company would repeatedly put signs supporting their chosen political party on our lawn against our wishes
- extremely large mold issue in basement apartments that caused illness. Mold was wiped down by management but not removed properly so grew back immediately. Management said tough luck. One girl had to live somewhere else while still paying rent due to serious illness
- bat in the kitchen and managment said they looked but couldn't find it so that was that
- heat in apartment controlled entirely by other tenants
- management lost all the post-dated cheques we wrote them so I had to buy new cheques. Keep receipts for everything
- lost water for a few days due to city pipe exploding and had to fend for ourselves
- once got YELLED at by management dropping by because his wife was the cleaner and she couldn't clean the kitchen well because it was messy. I didn't leave it messy I just happened to be the one with class that morning. Also who cares just don't clean it if it wasn't left cleanable.

But then they would not ever respond to any emails or phone calls. 
Our townhome faced one street and our mailbox was on another, so all deliveries, Ubers, door dashes arrived to random places and dropped off the items. Lost so many packages. Would have to go looking for food that was dropped off somewhere else. 
There was no on-site manager and the manager changed randomly without updating anyone. They moved us into a townhome we didn’t walk through without telling us prior. 
All the closet doors were super cheap and didn’t always close or stay on tracks. Called maintenance and they ‘fixed’ it and basically said it is what it is. Had a window that got a crack in it. Called in to be repaired and they forgot about it until the month we moved out. 
When we moved out, had to call several different people to complete the request. Took forever to get confirmation. When we had our schedule walk through, they didn’t show and we had to call and ask if they were coming.

She was also super invasive and would sit outside the property (unfortunately not illegal in Nebraska) and harass me and any guests. She also harassed me over my service animal.

Overall, it seemed she wasn't very knowledgeable of tenant rights and her legal responsibilities as a landlord.

Unfortunately, towards the end of my lease, the landlord decided to raise my rent by 1100 dollars because of my heat complaints after I sent a letter stating the building was unkempt. The decision to raise my rent was expressed over the telephone when he said, Yes, it was the letter that I’m raising the rent. He wanted me out. Finding a new UI tenant was also tricky because they refused to allow touring groups to speak to us about the condition of the building.

Only good is the buildings are fairly clean, safe and close to the subway. Another cons is Ryan/Wilstar having these terrible contractors. The building looks like a construction pit.  5 projects happening and none of them finishing. They did the garage 2 years ago and redoing it again. Why keep hiring terrible contractors?

Maintenance does decent repairs, but they show up sometimes with little to no warning. Rent will get raised every year, every time, and the only thing that being a longer term tenant gets you is that it is raised slightly less. If a pest problem from a different apartment spreads into yours management will kindly install two (2) sticky traps. If other tenants smoke inside the building even though it's a no smoking building, be aware that all the bathrooms share ventilation so you'll be able to peacefully have an allergic reaction to the smoke in your apartment while management claims they can't find who is smoking. You can't cook anything in the micro kitchens and you're not expected to because the Winooski restaurants are right there. Also the ceilings and floors are so creaky that you will get noise complaints for walking around your own home for things like getting up to use the restroom at night. The walls are more like a suggestion than anything else so either be a monk, or enjoy an audience whenever you use your bed for activities.

I also heard Ryan has connections with the contractors, explains why they are so horrible and nothing gets done. Balcony restoration has taken far too long, 2 condominiums have been built in the same time across the street.

Garage repairs are a horrible fail, guess it can be considered a free car wash/shower depending where you park. Wilstar should be thankful they haven't been sued over rust damages to tenants cars because of the moisture/water issues. Highly recommend a car wash pass in the winter months or else your car will rust away.

Garage ramps are not heated and can become dangerous in heavy snow fall.

Elevator upgrades are somewhat a fail, service elevator is almost always off causing delays and electrical issues seem to be the norm every few months.

Units are hit and miss, windows are incredibly drafty leading to cold winters and warm summers. The new roof AC has a lot left to be desired, its energy efficient and weak so what's the point if every apartment has their HVAC running continuously to try and cool down. Portable AC is a must!

Horrible at communication. Has a vacation house down the Cape and was there on our move-in day. She'd told me the previous tenant would hand off keys. I showed up and he had no idea about any of it and she was several hours away.

We were in constant danger from the other tenants he leased the building to and had to call 911 almost every week for domestic violence and disturbances. Roger was incredibly dishonest. When repairs were needed he used the cheapest labor possible and things were falling apart.

Faulty smoke alarms that would randomly go off for no reason, even when he finally replaced them after weeks, he didn't give us the right number of detectors so there were wires hanging out of the ceiling for months, gave up on asking for one more after a while.

Had a vegetable garden which was left untouched all summer, in August right when a lot of the plants were ready to be picked, a new landscaper he just hired ripped out all the herbs and vegetables with no warning. All while leaving garlic mustard plants untouched around the property.

Gutter above our main doorway was broken exactly above our main entrance so every rain we had to walk through what looked like water from a shower head, to get in or out, he never fixed it.

Asked to have the stairs by the main door fixed because we received a notice in the mail that they will no longer deliver our mail due to hazardous condition of the stairs to the mailbox.
He hired someone to fix the stairs. The stairs lifted off the cement in less than a week after the ""fix"" and he never properly fixed them

I don’t care if people smoke, but don’t do it indoors.  If you have issues with the smell like I do, don’t trust that you won’t be stuck living with it.

The other issue I had, and what caused me to move out, is the sudden rent increase.  Previous years the rent would increase by $25/month.  Still too much IMO since wages don’t increase at all, but it’s not an unreasonable amount compared to the market.  The new contract for the upcoming year jumped the price up by $100.  That’s more than a 10% increase to my rent without having done any updates to the building or unit.  Absolutely absurd price jump.

609,"PHILIP DOMMENGE - DOMMENGE REALTY , HOMESMART",DENVER,COLORADO,80224,US,"Philip is a realtor through Dommenge Realty and HomeSmart who managed multiple units in Denver Colorado, and provided bad experiences to his many tenants.  He refused to make necessary repairs throughout the entirety of the multi-year leases, declined to acknowledge the condition of the units upon move-in, and refused to meet potential/new tenants in person from day one. Multiple tenants report they have never met or seen Philip, contrary to their requests, the entire time they rented from him.  Additionally, he frequently threatened eviction in response to requests for repairs and even made a disabled tenant attempt repairs, which ultimately failed and resulted in him threatening to charge unrelated roommates for it. 

Furthermore, he demonstrated a lack of knowledge regarding the laws and attempted to unlawfully withhold the security deposit of a tenant who requested repairs. Despite the existence of evidence proving damages were from a previous tenant, he still attempted to withhold the deposit and only relinquished it after being threatened with legal action due to him not providing the security deposit notice in the correct format in the time required by law.  The thousand-yard-stare is further proof that this landlord is not dealing with a full box of crayons. 

It's important to note that his website claims that he manages multiple profitable rental properties. However, my experience suggests that this is because he does nothing besides collect rent and neglects his responsibility as a landlord to provide a habitable living space.

There was a rent increase between the listing and the move-in cost, which was frustrating, but it appeared to be due to an issue with the broker rather than with Michael and he did not raise our rent during the three years we rented from him.

The bad: Walworth scheduled ongoing maintenance with little heads-up, there were constantly workers and inspectors coming in and out of the house, construction in the basement went on for months. Fire alarm and CO inspectors went into our bedrooms repeatedly at unscheduled times. Occasionally the water or internet would be shut off with no warning. Despite this, Walworth complained about needing to raise rent and loudly disliked that the couple living in the basement were only paying for one room. He gossiped about other & past tenants and clearly didn’t respect us as people at all. There were strict rules about substance use (no drinking onsite), quiet hours, candles, and cleanliness — odd given that we were all functional adults. 
The ugly: there were no locks in the house except for the front door, which was code activated. Walworth considered the common spaces to be his property and would show up at random times with no warning to hang out in our living room/kitchen. Months into our lease, we were told that we were only renting the Bedrooms from him and the rest of the house was him generously sharing (he did not live on-site and it had NOT been advertised as a room share). The bedrooms had no locks and Walworth repeatedly entered without knocking or warning, took pictures of our things, and had ample opportunity to sort through our stuff. On several occasions, he entered a girl’s bedroom alone and started talking to her about rent with the door closed behind him. It felt deeply unsafe and around May, we all started sleeping elsewhere.

He sees it as his job to fight with his tenants. His default response is to reject, argue over and deny every single request no matter how innocent or reasonable. Nothing is easy. Nothing is straightforward. He employs a bizarre, inhuman, faux-legal tone in all his correspondence that is equal parts demeaning and passive-aggressive. He will pull incredibly shady tactics like listing at a certain price, then telling you that is the discounted price if you take on some of his duties (ie. shovelling snow, tending the garden), then harass you ceaselessly about not doing them to his satisfaction until you give up and accept the higher rent - which is what he wanted all along. This is just one example. He will pounce on any loophole and exploit any shred of naïveté in a new tenant to squeeze a little more out of them or be a little more derelict in his duties. 

He is a deeply unpleasant person utterly devoid of empathy. Again, I truly believe he is a ******* who sees his tenants only as income streams. Never in my time living in one of his buildings did I feel the slightest consideration for myself as a human being. I was an ideal tenant. I could go a year without contacting him, was never late on payment, kept the apartment clean and well-maintained. And I still walked away from it despising him and feeling genuine horror about the state of housing in this city.

629,ZEHR GROUP,KITCHENER,ONTARIO,N2G1X5,CA,"I've been renting from the Zehr group for several years now. They have many benefits, the largest of which is service. Being a subset of a larger corporation they are well-equipped to handle tenant issues, and have lots of employed staff and contractors to help. Repairs and inspections for apartment maintenance are regular, and things do get done when asked. Compared to my previous landlords, they are fantastic and certainly the best I've rented from in the KW area.

Some downsides? It still takes a long time to get things done. Some things are speedy, if they can just send their one property manager for your location, other things take weeks to book. Definitely remind them of things if you're waiting on parts/etc. as they will forget to check on things. Sometimes with contractors too they have some poor communication, and won't be told when something hasn't been fixed, so be on your toes to remind them when things are still not working. The other main downside is that this group will ALWAYS charge you the maximum legal rent increase every year without fail. 

Generally though, great place to rent from. Compared to other landlords, of course.",2,4,4,5,4

I had cockroaches and took a day off work to wait for an exterminator that never came. They constantly switched property managers so it was difficult to know who to get in contact with. They stole $400 off my security deposit for paint when I was there longer than a year. Paint is included in regular wear and tear.

A definite pro was that management was not in your business and never heard a complain from them or had a visit. I would say a solid 4/5.

She refused to tell me who it was, or give me a phone number to look out for. All I got was a simple “he’ll call you.” All the while, there was a literal pool of water in my living room that stretched over three feet long and was deep enough to soak a towel straight through sopping and have plenty of water left over. Of course, this means the apartment developed mold! But of course, there’s a clause in the lease stating that any/all mold is the renter’s responsibility. However, because this mold was directly caused by her incompetence, I got her to send out someone to take care of it. In the meantime of playing yet another game of phone tag, I purchased industrial strength mold killer and did what I could to get as much removed as possible. When the mold man showed up, he was not a licensed professional - he was literally just some guy with two unmarked spray bottles. He sprayed it on the wall and told me to wipe it off in fifteen minutes and left. Literally a five minute interaction.

Maintenance was very unresponsive, even for emergencies, would often burst in unannounced, and whatever they did to fix problems often made them worse, and we ended up having to fix them ourselves.

687,LIFE ON QUEEN,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4E 1H7,CA,"With all these politicians discussing affordable housing and homelessness, I find it absolutely disgusting that the Ford government has done nothing to address the appalling living conditions and management harassment David Weiss’ “Life On Queen” Westwood Management. submits their tenants through.
Saddest part is that he gets away with it over and over. The Landlord Tenant Tribunal issues him a mere three thousand dollar fine. A slap in the face to the affected tenants.
 The Toronto Star’s reporter, Stephen Spencer Davis, has previously reported numerous times regarding David Weiss, the owner of multiple buildings on Queen Street East. Operating as “Life On Queen”

For the last nine years my wife has lived in one of his buildings. For that nine years she has been promised numerous times that the various repairs would be attended to.
Jennifer has resided at one of the Queen Street East buildings for 9 years now.

When she took possession she was promised that they would be installing kitchen cabinets as there were none existing. Additionally,  the management assured her that they would be repairing the bathroom floor as it is rotted out and the toilet is literally falling through the existing floor.

The supers are constantly calling the tenants “crazy” and/or “troublemakers”. 

There is a constant change of both maintenance and management staff. Often the management company will have tenants who are behind in their rent to do repairs in other tenants’ apartments. 
With all these politicians speaking about housing and rents I find it appalling that not one person of authority has reached out to the numerous complaints tenants of these ten buildings have filed.

Hopefully, the media will take notice and assist with getting these tenants assistance in receiving the repairs and safety we all expect from our landlord.",1,1,1,1,1

Concept will take an eternity to respond to non-emergency maintenance requests and will only react, begrudgingly, once you threaten to sue them.

699,JUDY FERLAND,TURNERS FALLS,MASSACHUSETTS,01376,US,"Paranoid landlord who thinks the world is out to get her lives below units, closely watches occupants. The units are enticing because of the downtown location, but not worth the harassment.Requests for repairs were met with animosity, always. When I mentioned black mold in the attic/ceilings and the water raining from the ceiling, I was made to feel like an annoyance and got no response. Every routine repair became a personal attack. Judy prefers menacing texts and accusatory handwritten letters in all caps taped to your door instead of civil communication, but you get used to it after awhile. Forget about having company, if you have anyone visit, she needs to know who they are, what their relationship is to you, and will accuse you of hiding a secret roommate from her if anyone ever comes over to visit, or she will be openly rude to you in front of guests. 
When my 40 year old out of code WarmMorning gas heater leaked gas into my bedroom while I was sleeping and was later red tagged by Berkshire Gas, rendering it illegal to use, it took Judy two months to get me any kind of heat. I was without heat from November to January before she so graciously installed a $50 greenhouse heater in the bedroom that was missing components to work properly. I was never able to get the apartment to 60 degrees once, it was always freezing.
While Judy was working her night shift job, her live in alcoholic boyfriend would frequently come up and bang on my door, demanding I give him liquor or run to the package store, often banging on my door begging for alcohol and slurring his speech. Once, I was woken at 4 am by Judy screaming at me that I need to stop making noise. I explained to her that it was the neighbor (her friends son) but she continued to threaten me until I asked the neighbor to physically go to her door and apologize for the noise, which he happily did but Judy somehow continued to blame me instead.

We found out when we called a junk removal team to take things out of the basement and they charged us a bio-hazard fee which RM refused to pay. When he was told about it, he did not contact specialists to come out, he had a friend come ""fix"" it by cleaning the basement. His excuse was ""well it's a wet basement its suppose to smell."" Flushed one day when friend was in basement and he came up and said he saw what we were talking about. He was also told to get the sewage insurance sometime during all this as well and when he got it a month later, we had an condemn notice on our door because the city had received word our sump pump (which was constantly pumping and going a lot of the time) was pumping raw sewage into the yard, down the side walk and into the street, he attempted to call the city and openly ADMITED in a voicemail he was waiting for insurance to kick in which wouldnt be for a while. THEN he finally have city certified plumbers come out and flush the pipe so it wasn't pumping into the basement. This all took place between Feb-June (we moved July 1). Not to mention the bathroom he complained about doing because you could hear the floor squish under your feet after a shower bc it cost him 5k for another friend to fix a couple years before this. Constantly asked us to go ""half"" on any of these big repairs. Not to mention as we were moving out he would lie to other possible renters about the house.

We called and emailed and texted and they wouldn't respond because it was a weekend and they were out of office. Their phone line was even advertised as for emergencies, but we had to leave a message. Also, when they DO send a repair person, they don't tell you they do, you find out when they knock at your door. The property was alright, but there was a gas smell from the furnace and the oven did not have a functioning fan, so the fire alarm would go off every time we cooked.

Excessive poison sprayed on everything including people's potted plants. Any nature they see, they destroy. Use to have a beautiful strip of forest over a canal with rare birds and butterflies, now it's grass. Watched a maintenance man club a skunk that wandered in to the area. Glass, trash, dog crap, oil, and toxins are found in every square inch of the road and grass near any building or dumpster. They are tearing down even more oak and pine trees to build more overpriced condos. I have watched them dig up and replace smaller trees in some areas every year. (See excessive poison use).

Money wise is straight forward. Rent, water, trash, pet cost. Only hidden cost is laundry at $4 per load to use their machines.

Attitude is flippant. They can no longer retain employees so it's a dice roll on how they will react to literally anything. But typically if you call calm and have a good record they are happy to work with you and help on the small things. The issue is that they will lie and forget constantly.

710,INVITATIONS HOMES,PHOENIX/TEMPE,ARIZONA,85284,US,"Rented multiple times with invitation homes in Phoenix and Mesa AZ. The application process is fairly easy, always be careful when reading lease agreements. They have made multiple errors on their end, with our application even being rejected completely due to not having the required household income (as of 3/3/23 rent is 2.1k/mo for a 3 bedroom house, we had to make 3x the rent). We knew that our application was wrongly denied and called their office to sort it out. They admitted their mistake and approved our application.  You can get a $300 discount if you've rented with them before and have good history on your account. They tried to get away with not applying the discount, so you might need to ask about it multiple times before you pay the move in fees. It doesn't seem like they clean the houses at all. The appliances are always dirty, the fridge vents and coils are caked with dust etc, making the fridge work harder and increasing the electric bill. The dishwashers always have gunk in the filters and drain. They do not drain the water heaters yearly for maintenance. IH will recommend you to a renters insurance company, which ended up costing us way more than any renters insurance we've had before. We stuck with our same insurance and only pay $15/mo. They will say that tenants are in charge of landscape, but the whole time that the house was vacant (was about a month or two) they let the weeds get overgrown and spread, fruit trees in the back are basically dead, cats claw vines going over to the neighbors side. Repairs will cost you. Had a leak in my a/c a month after move in and they charged $75. We didn't have a/c for almost 2 days. It would have been another day or a week even cause the 2 workers said they didn't have the part, would need to order it, come back another day.

My yard backed up to a busy street, and the fence was low, so he could have easily jumped the fence and been hit by a car.

Move the offices your staff use to another  (renovated just for them while my siding is falling off) building and blame the tenants for not reporting the lack of heat (in the dead of winter) enough (was reported over 3 times in 2 weeks, took nesrly 4 weeks, lots of screaming and going above the head of every single staff member on site to get this done.). Couple this with frequent (4 in a month is the current record) entries into domiciles for random and unjustified reasons that have never improved my status of living. When I moved in water was included, it no longer is and every year I have had price hikes on my rent while my apartment falls into worse and worse disrepair thanks to all of the repair tickets I submit being ignored, I've stopped submitting tickets altogether.

Landlord lived out of state so he could not help with issues when needed - when my pipes froze, he couldn't get anyone to come help thaw them for me for three days. The front door had a gap big enough to let a draft in, so winters were very cold. The roof had a leak and the front porch was rotted - I paid $1000 to have the porch repaired after my ex-wife fell through it (when we did a rent-to-own.) Skirting under the trailer had detached and allowed cold air to get to the pipes, which is what caused them to freeze in the first place, and it was never fixed. The rent-to-own down payment of $3000 was not refunded to me when I moved to just renting the place after my divorce, and my security deposit was not returned when I left. The yard had to be mowed or I'd face a $75 fine, but I still needed to pay someone to mow. I would get notes on my door to warn about the grass being too high or to tell me we couldn't have certain trash like mattresses outside for pickup - even though pickup for furniture was not an option, I still had to pay for a fee for garbage pickup. The toilet was broken so that it was constantly running water, which hiked up my water bill. The landlord didn't notice that the bill was hundreds of dollars too high despite the fact that the bill was in his name. He would email me a scan of the bill and I had to do the math to separate the utility/lot rent from the actual rent for the home, which was a separate payment. I was given no time to get fully moved out and the landlord sent his superintendent to come inspect the house to make sure it looked decent enough for the next person to move in - this affected my ability to pack in a timely manner because I needed to be there with the superintendent.

Landlord is on the phone constantly, and yells very loudly throughout their portion of the property. Landlord walks very loudly and moves furniture throughout the night. Landlord has made many offensive comments regarding people of color. Landlord has also assumed tenant was a prostitute because tenant was out working late at night.

There are 3 floors, with 7 of us living in individual 'rooms'. 

My request to terminate my lease was completely ignored and I lost my security deposit when I moved out because the landlord refused to acknowledge me. There was no smoke detector in my room and I genuinely felt unsafe with some of the tenants. 

My attempt to complain to the Department of Building Inspection was ignored. Even though the inspector confirmed that I was living in an illegal boarding house, the complaint ultimately did not go through. Atenant lawyer told me that there are times when landlords could bribe DBI inspectors into ignoring a problem; it's hard to prove in this situation, but it is likely. Some of my other housemates were aware that the landlord was already facing several complaints and a lawsuit about their behavior. Some of them have personally taken bribes themselves to not raise any more complaints.

When I moved in, the dishwasher had standing water & larvae swimming in the water. Old dishwasher was eventually removed & it smelled like raw sewage. Replacement unit never worked.

He also enjoys essentially trapping tenants, as he has a propensity to lie and blackball tenants who attempt to move out to a property not owned by him. He has a predilection for gossip and will attempt to use tenants for said gossip as well as turning them against each other for his own personal amusement. And with how poorly he maintains his properties- such as ""maintaining"" gas cooktops but refusing to properly ventilate kitchens, not ensuring that all apartments have working smoke detectors, not properly fumigating against cockroaches, and refusing to test for mold in the pipes- it is a wonder that only one has caught on fire in the past few years.",1,1,1,2,1

There were rats in the laundry room and lower apartments; when I told Mike I could smell dead rats, he told me ""It just smells like laundry"". Recycle/garbage bins were impossible to access because of a tenant's vehicle parked in the way so the area under the stairs piled up with rotting garbage/standing water. We ended up throwing everything in the dumpster every week. One time, an HRM sidewalk plow drove into the side of the building in the middle of the night, cracking the siding and causing the basement tenant's window to be stuck closed. Nothing was done about it at the time and there is a big hole in the siding to this very day lol. 
The basement tenants moved out because of the rats and told me they had to get a doctor's note to break the lease.

Several tenants' pets also died in the fire because people weren't able to get out early. Hill tried to blame the fire on the spa that rented out the first floor of the building, despite there being no evidence to support this claim. This seemed extra cruel as two of the spa's employees were also tenants, so had lost not only their jobs but their homes as well (insurance suit is still ongoing to determine fault). I had been in the next-door building a lot because I was friendly with some of the tenants, and it was often poorly kept, with little attempt made to keep public areas clean or well-lit. Our building had many fewer units so didn't have the same problems, and Hill seemed responsive and fair in his dealings with me, so I'm rating him better in those areas, but after what happened with the fire my entire experience with him has been tainted.

I was willing to overlook having an open dumpster outside my bedroom window for 90% of my stay, the gates not working 40% of the time and my car being broken into twice as just the hazards of living in a popular apartment complex - but the exit process was so painful and expensive it felt like I was being punished for leaving even though I had rented there for two years.

The staff was usually very nice, responsive and helped me deal with any of my problems (such as just horrifically noisy neighbors) and repairs didn't take long (even if sometimes they had to be done more than once), but the moment they found out I was leaving, it was like I didn't exist and suddenly no one wanted to be transparent with me at all. I couldn't even get a checklist of the things they wanted done before I left and they wouldn't do a walk through with me either.

I had to utilizcomplexes aside from my own website to gain communication about issues I had or emergency maintenance when my toilet overload and needed to be snaked, it was a week before someone showed by then I fixed it on my own somehow.

To the point stairwells were on safe to travel up. Stray cats and dog poop everywhere. Can’t stress enough how rusty and corroded metal support beams, stairs and railings were. When I brought it up as a concern (multiple times) they sent a contractor out to cover exposed rusted out beams with plastic panels to hide the damage. Also there are open crawl spaces beneath most of the buildings, exposed wires and open transformer boxes across the grounds. They only have a small maintenance staff so maintenance requests are rarely answered unless you are a “problem” tenant. It took me taking a per diem and threatening to break lease (using renter protection laws in DE) for them to begin answering my maintenance requests. Maintenance would come into my apartment with no warning or heads up and rarely if ever when I actually scheduled them. In the apartment all my appliances were outdated and many either broke multiple times or had major issues that were never addressed after submitting requests. The apartment itself was old, out of date with extensive water damage in the walls and ceiling. I had a sink hole in the floor by my front door (did eventually get fixed). I also almost had an electrical fire start when an outlet that had been installed wrong overloaded due to faulty wiring. I had to replace my own air filters and run extra box fans w/ filters bc the HVAC system was so disgusting. My air conditioner leaked and caused massive mold/humidity problems in my apartment which maintenance never addressed.

He was very attentive with repairs, and while he didn’t have some of the more modern technologies that would allow for things like digital payments, I never once got the sense that he would lose track of things. The only real concern about this property came from the poor drainage in the central courtyard when it snows, which mostly owes to the fact that the complex was originally built in the 1970s (it is entirely possible this has been dealt with since we lived there).

Squirrels rip into the trash constantly and crawl into the roofs, where they've ripped holes into the roof. Ant colonies have been known to get into apartments on the ground floor through the holes in the baseboards.
Maintenance times range from 2 weeks to months. You have to pester them (call every day) to get things done. Again they do not have enough maintenance workers to deal with the size of the apartment complex. When filling out a maintenance request you have to provide permission to enter the apartment but it is impossible to know when this will happen.
There are little things too like it is hard to walk around the complex, as there really aren't any sidewalks from one side to another. The roads are essentially one lane on areas with the size of the potholes. They have tried to fill potholes in around where they do tours but many are left unchecked. During winter there is rarely any work on clearing the roads or sidewalks.

Promised he'd come fix our cabinent and then proceeded to not fix it ever. Was relatively chill about us breaking a door literally the day before new tenants came to view the house.

Extremely hands off, only saw him maybe 3 times in the 4 years I lived there. Of those, they include the one time I caught him parked in the driveway and using our shed to store an oven he'd picked up on the side of the road and decided he wanted to install in our house (he didn't know anyone was living there despite me having picked up my keys a month before). The oven remained in the shed until we left, depsite a promise to ""be back Tuesday to bring it in"".

The second time I ever saw him was when he showed up unnanounced one night (didn't come inside) and demanded a girl who had left the lease pay him 4 months of rent. We reminded him she didn't live there anymore and it was a different girl sending rent money (always with our address in the memo) that he had happily been accepting for, you guessed it, 4 months, without question.

Didn't clean the house before we moved in. Did let us paint the walls however we wanted, and let us turn the fridge into a giant chalkboard.

Overall just a kind of okay landlord? He'll fix big stuff for you but any little projects, you have to do yourself. Never entered the house without 24 hours notice, the lawn service he paid for was awful, and snow clearing was tenant's responsibility. Didn't raise rent on us, except for the last year we lived there he informed us if we renewed, rent would be raised a grand total of $10/person for a better internet plan.

She uses Peter Batiste as her property manager agent and he taught her how to renovict, harass tenants non stop invade their privacy constantly and never do repairs.

Health and safety: Overall the property was very cleanly and well-maintained. No pest problems whatsoever in the two years we lived there. The only reason I don't give full marks here is that the bathrooms were not ventilated properly. Instead of a channel to the outdoors, the bathroom ""vent"" fans just recirculated air inside the bathrooms. This led to an unavoidable moisture buildup, and a constant fight against bathroom mold, especially in the winter. It also caused rust spotting in the mirror.

Rent stability: rent rose more than 15% each year, with no explanation beyond that rent was going up everywhere in the area. We wound up leaving because a mortgage payment would be the same as the rent they wanted for a 2bed 2bath.

Privacy: No problems here. Always posted timely notice before any maintenance entry at least a week prior, directly on every unit's door. No personal information requested beyond proof of income, whether we had pets, and other legal requirements for renting in the state.

Respect: No discrimination nor harassment. Total refusal to negotiate on rent increases, or even consider doing so. Maintenance staff were friendly and respectful but property management were consistently rude. Every phone call or in-person conversation we had with them I felt nothing but veiled contempt. Further, they tried to pocket most of our security deposit on move-out with several bogus claims of damage.

At one point she got fined by the city for us having trash cans out on the street, and tried to get mad at us, and we were like, if you fix the garage door we can put them in the garage, but that was apparently not an option. 

The house had many bizarre features, including a normal wooden window, which opened and closed, inside the shower. It rotted out like three times over the years because there is not supposed to be a window in a shower (the shower head actually came out of the frame of the window, I wish I had a picture of it, it was wild). Eventually she had her friendly but ridiculously incompetent maintenance team move the shower head the the middle of the tub to protect the window from further damage, but they didn’t install, like, a rain head, they put in a regular shower head blasting directly down from the center of the tub. The same guys painted our windows shut. They also installed an interior door in our back door, which immediately began rotting out.

Our fridge died in the middle of the COVID lockdown and it took her over a week to get us a new one. At one point the kitchen sink didn’t work for over a week and we were washing dishes in the tub.

Devi herself was always massively disrespectful, constantly accusing us of violating our lease with no proof (not sure how she could possibly have any proof, I lived there for over ten years and never once saw her in person). At a certain point she started refusing to let us take old roommates off the lease and put new people on, so we just stopped updating her after a while, and then she pitched a fit that she “didn’t even know who lives there.” We were trying to supply you with that information Devi, but you told us you didn’t want it.

He gave me the wrong paint types twice, and then tried to charge me upon move-out even though I had documentation regarding the whole matter.

Additionally, they put the onus on the tenant for air filters, charging for them instead of just replacing them and acting snotty about it. Finally, don't expect to ever have the on call safety officer come to your aid. Every time we called them because someone parked in our reserved spot the officer was unavailable which makes it feel like the point of paying for a spot was null and void.

Long story short, because the carpet was (5?) years old they charged us 300$ for “damages” in replacing the old carpet. We emailed before and after photos and they blew us off completely. They were very poor communicators when it came to any post charges to the apartment. I felt like I was being scammed, honestly. My time at the apartment was normal, no complaints. They did raise the price by 200$ when we wanted to renew, which is why we left. They also evicted our neighbors to make room for an AirBnb, I believe some were able to move to other apartments in the neighborhood, but that never sat well with me.

Most of these issues they take months to fix and the management does not communicate with renters about any fixes or updates to the property. There have also been some safety issues and packages stolen from the lobby. The mail and delivery people have told residents that they are not given access codes and so cannot deliver packages and mail into the building effectively.

They're both terrible.  4 separate times during ""corridor upgrades"" contractors allowed themselves into my apartment with NO 24 hr notice.  The corridor upgrades were to rip out existing marble tile and wall protectors (with crowbars), then they replaced the tile with cheaper tile, and put up slightly different wall protectors and paint them a different colour.  After they flooded the place with drywall dust from the patching and tiling.  It was bad.  My rent was $897 for a 240 sq ft 1 1/2, then they cancelled the free cable and gave us $25 off per month, for 4 months.  Then it was time to renew and they reported the original rent plus $22/mo.  For a backdoor rent increase of $47/month.  We took them to the TAL but it was technically legal.  This year they're trying to increase the rent by 4% if you have an unrenovated place, and 7% if you have a renovated place.  Also, they leave apartments empty for 1 year, renovate them, then once the year has passed, they jack up the rent.  Most BACHELOR apartments in my building are going for over $1140/mo now, BEFORE the 7% increase.  For 240 sq ft.  Neighbors bring in flies and they do nothing, neighbors bring in ants and they do nothing.  Some floors REEK of smoke and ashes, the building's non-smoking, and they do nothing.

After I moved out they sent me back my deposit minus itemized deductions - a first! I was a quiet renter and I always paid my rent on time so I don't know how they handled those issues.

Finally got desperate enough to go out and buy a window unit because I would not (COULD not) leave my dog in the house when it was 90 degrees indoors. They refused to reimburse us. Never did fix the central AC. The washer/dryer combo also only worked for the first couple of months we were there, and when I requested it to be fixed they literally said no. Like I said hello, this machine is broken and does not work and they quite literally just said yes it does and never sent anyone to check.

Maintenance would regularly come into my unit with no warning whatsoever, but left plenty of evidence that they were there. Things moved around, closet doors open, a literal gaping hole in the wall under the carbon monoxide detector they installed with no warning. Like literally a hole punched into the drywall, never patched up, dust and crumbs on the rug below it. Muddy boot prints up our stairs, a spent light bulb just sitting on my couch. Like thanks for changing the bulb I guess but with no warning??? Creepy as hell. They DID in fact keep the deposit due to this hole in the wall, regardless of me immediately putting in the claim and taking photos of the wall that I discovered upon returning home, and the literal Clue footprints left on my rug.

927,METRO WEST HOUSING SOLUTIONS,LAKEWOOD,COLORADO,80226,US,"Not the best place, but still incredibly cheap for the value. The apartment itself is okay - not the nicest, but again, not totally awful and unlivable. They are about to do renovations, which may have something to do with the complete lack of response on anything from maintenance for months and the terrible communication from Metro West themselves. The apartment manager is really nice and attentive, and it seems like he's mostly just overworked with his hands tied, because Metro West has left me on the hook waiting for a response to a VERY important lease change I've been waiting for them to approve for almost six months now. Maintenance almost never gets back to me unless it's an absolute emergency - I haven't had a working garbage disposal since last July, 10 months now, and when mice moved in from my upstairs neighbors they also didn't respond for several months and left me having to take care of it myself. They did respond to a few emergency maintenance requests I've had in a fairly timely manner, though. I genuinely wonder if they're just not fulfilling non-emergency maintenance issues because they plan to take care of it during the renovations (which they are paying fully for and hiring movers for and not displacing us during, although that's largely because of federal law.) That said, it's been some of the lowest rent in the area for all the years I've lived here, and is not a dump by any means. Overall I think it's worth the value, just be prepared to deal with an overworked staff and a management company that isn't malicious, just has godawful communication.",1,3,5,4,2

A shelf once fell and struck one of the tenants, in our unit, destroying their glasses and bruising their face, this wasn't of concern to management. Recently we have been continuously waking up to find our water shut off for half the day without explanation and have also lost power sporadically with very poor communication on when it would return. We are paying a truly ridiculous amount for rent as well, if you have any choice to not move in here, they are hilariously incompetent and very uncaring about the problems they are causing and refusing to fix.",1,2,1,1,1
930,IAN MACKINNONS,ANTIGONISH,NOVA SCOTIA,B2G2W5,CA,"This landlord is condescending and impatient with tenets. If you want something done he’s angry and annoyed your stoves broken, you have mould issue, you need a lightbulb, etc. he doesn’t look after his apartments or keep them up to date, holes in the screens, marks/holes in the walls. He painted over our mould issue, we weren’t allowed to raise the freezer temperature past a certain amount because the freezer won’t work, but the temp isn’t enough to keep things frozen. Before we got the place he admitted that he didn’t get it cleaned because the other tenet cleaned it. I signed the papers because at a glance it looked clean. Upon further inspection I had to scrub the shower, the toilet, there was grime all in the back of the toilet as well. Under the oven and under the burners was disgusting too. our friends who lived next door had to do the same things. He then doesn’t want to give me the damage deposit because it took “4hours of cleaning” even though we cleaned the whole apartment, we left the burners and the freezer the way we found it. When asking for the receipts of the cleaning company he couldn’t give them to us and told us his wife cleaned the apartment. He was rude during this whole correspondence. Our neighbours told us his “cleaner” aka his wife wasn’t in there for more then an hour cleaning and she was smoking in the apartment as she did. This is the seconds time a landlord in Antigonish has attempted to do this to us. Overall this landlord takes advantage of his tenets.",1,3,4,4,1

933,AXIS APARTMENTS - CONCERT PROPERTIES,VANCOUVER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V6T0B6,CA,"The managers at Axis Apartments are all quite friendly, if not a bit overly friendly at times--it's easy to get trapped in conversations about each other's personal lives even if you just came down to the front office to make a small request or have a question. My unit was in very good condition when I first moved in about a year ago, except for the odd spot on the ceiling where some of the paint had lifted a bit. Of course, I wasn't charged for the preexisting damage. I have found no mold, have never seen a cockroach or a rodent, and the only critter condition I get is my own fault due to me having the windows open in the summer and allowing fruit flies in. The walls are thick and the slab doors allow for a great deal of sound to be entirely cut out. I almost never can hear my neighbors, and if I can, noise complaints are taken seriously. The maintenance is diligent and quick for any matter, from replacing loose microwave handles to replacing whole washing and drying units within hours or days of being requested to do so. They also only ever come with paper notices posted on doors at least a week prior to maintenance entering, which they only do for routine checks, or if the fire alarm is going off in a unit. Rent is expensive though (common for this area though) and increases when the managers are allowed to raise it, around 30$ or so, but I have never had to make extreme changes to my income to manage my rent. My only complaints are that the office hours are extremely short, lasting from 12 pm to 5 pm, and the managers take a LOT of smoke breaks. They do put a sign on the door for their return, but it isn't always accurate. Catching them while they're in the office is a game of luck. Emailing for a quick meeting is usually no trouble, but it can be inconvenient if you want to try and pop in while you're on the way out or in. Overall, I've enjoyed my experience at AXIS apartments greatly.",4,5,4,5,5
934,GREYSTAR (CAMPUS VIEW BRANCH),HARRISONBURG,VIRGINIA,22801,US,"At first, I couldn't find anything to complain about the actual property. I knew going in that a lot of college kids would be there so noise was something I'd have to deal with but I was given a preference form and I selected only working adults and female roommates so I assumed everything would be okay. Management had changed in February of 2022, from Matchbox to Greystar, and it seemed like everything was fine. I renewed my lease because even if my roommates were gone, my rate would stay the same. But two months into my new lease, Greystar shoved two college boys into my apartment, despite that I requested having working adult women and only gave me a week to decide if I wanted to put up with this or be moved to a different unit, but now in a smaller room with three roommates. Originally the two young boys were going to be in an all-boys unit but Greystar had no idea that said unit had a dog despite throwing out a pet form a month ago to check on us. One of the boys was allergic to the dogs and had informed management beforehand so they knew but never checked. And because they signed a lease together, they couldn't be separated and apparently the easiest solution was cramming them in a place with one single female. It doesn't matter if things worked out. This should not have been the solution. They didn't care for my safety in what I could have dealt with and they never cared for this boy's health if they never checked the unit for an animal.

I once had to wait 24 hours to get my toilet fixed, They never did anything about the mold under the carpet after the water heaters exploded in my apartment and the one above me, nor did they address the water damage to the walls and ceiling. There were frequent drug deals on the street next to the complex and I had people several times shooting up on the grassy area next to the stairs to my apartment. The management never did anything about this. Snow removal consisted of tossing a handful of de-ice on the snow. They never shoveled, and the one time they plowed the parking lot, the plow driver kept his blade a foot off the ground to keep from hitting the speed bumps and it didn't clear anything.

When we had an issue with a mole in the basement she was there next day with an expert and had all repairs done within a few days. She did proactive and preventative maintenance and kept active pest control traps checked regularly by a professional (living behind a restaurant this was a game changer).

Even things like the microwave having blown out, or mold in the bedrooms, which I consider to be a part of the contractual obligation represented by the lease, requires repeated pushes in order to be solved.

He is kind and respectful. However, he is slow to act in some circumstances. We had a terminally ill and erratic neighbor who had several violent outbursts during mental health crises which led to minor bodily harm to another tenant before being evicted.

He inherited the property from his father, and they managed to be sneaky and put it on two different addresses so that they can claim that it's less than a 4 unit building.

960,PAUL CATAN,ONEONTA,NEW YORK,13820,US,"Paul's a nice guy and all, but I've lived in this apartment for over three years now and he is incredibly unreliable. Let's break it down:

1. It took me a while to notice but the first two years I lived here I didn't have a single fire alarm. Not one.
2. Two burners on my stove were broken and the stove itself is older than me. It took him almost a year to fix the burners rather than replacing the whole stove despite the fact that he was also the owner of the local Sears. 
3. I had a wasp's nest outside my apartment and he told me to handle it myself.
4. My original neighbor was abusive to his girlfriend. We had to call the cops on him twice. The second time, Paul told me that I had to record their arguments as proof and that HE HAD TOLD THEM I WAS GOING TO BE RECORDING THEM. For the rest of that neighbor's lease he would glare at me whenever he saw me and I was afraid he'd try to hurt me. Thankfully he never did, but the threat was clear.
5. My second winter here he never plowed or shoveled so I slipped on the ice while trying to get into my car and got a concussion. He now shovels the walks but still doesn't plow the driveways. 
6. Sometimes it will take him WEEKS to cash my rent check, including the week it takes him to retrieve it from my mailbox (Sears has recently closed, and he hasn't given me another option for delivering the check to him). 

Like I said, he's nice and all when he finally DOES do something, but he clearly has no care for his tenants' safety unless it affects him somehow. The rent's cheap compared to the rest of the city, which is why I'm still here, but it would be nice if he could keep up on what is supposed to be his job.",1,1,3,1,3

966,GUNBARREL CENTER,BOULDER,COLORADO,80301,US,"This apartment complex is really lovely in a lot of ways. The apartment itself was one of the nicer ones I've lived in, the building overall was secure and packed to the brim with amenities, and the staff were always respectful and helpful.

The community was full of wonderful and helpful people and their resident handyman was kind, timely, efficient, and respectful. 

That being said, we got slapped with an almost 30% rent increase when we asked about re-signing our lease after our first year there, on an already pretty pricy rent (average for the area but that doesn't mean Boulder prices aren't a racket).

Our shower vent made terrible noises and the “repair” just made it worse. There was also cigarette residue on the walls from previous tenants. We were left to handle any mold from poor ventilation on our own. After we left, they charged us extra on top of our damage deposit for natural wear and tear, or things which we had requested to be fixed but were ignored.

It was filthy when I moved in. There was animal feces on the walls, urine-saturated carpet, the bathroom had human waste on the wall behind the toilet that smelled horrible. Of course there was mold too. I had to clean everything because they wouldn't. It was a basement unit and the carpet was wet every time it rained (I'm assuming a foundation issue). Their solution was to give me a box fan and dehumidifier, which they only let me use when it rained and they'd retrieve it a few days later. It flooded so badly once that it ruined some of my belongings. Maintenance would let themselves in without reasonable notice. The house was being put on the market and they gave keys to vendors, which that wasn't the issue... The issue was that one vendor was a photography company responsible for taking pictures of the property so they could list it on the market. After they had already taken pictures, a man came by in the evening and OPENED MY DOOR. I asked him if I could help him with anything and he said he was just making sure the key was the right one. I asked him what work he was doing and he just said ""I'm with the company."" I felt unsafe and they did nothing to help me feel secure that some man who wouldn't identify himself had a key to my home. The vendors are supposed to return the keys after their work is done. So either they were not vigilant about getting the key back, or he made a copy. It's important to note that I am a female and was living alone at the time.

Only thing they seemed to care about was the grass getting mowed every week at the crack of dawn which WILL shake your entire apartment if you're next to one of the strips of grass. Had a gap over an inch under my front door, old windows that molded no matter how you tried to clean them and the freezer smelled so bad it leached into my food and even my ice cubes. Upstairs neighbor fell asleep with his sink on and flooded my bathroom, had to call 3 times over the course of an HOUR to get someone to do anything with water actively pouring through my ceiling vent.  Despite my fuse box hissing and crackling from the water all they did was send an old guy with a hammer, a screwdriver and a literal hair dryer. He unscrewed the fuse box and shoved the dryer in the hole for an hour. They claimed they would 'send a professional' later that week but that never happened. There's definitely severe water damage in that wall but thankfully I was already planning on moving out when this happened.

There aren’t fans in the bathroom so all we can do is open the window. There was a lot of damage that we found from previous tenants. Window screens were broken and the walls had cracks. The carpets are also stained. The front door doesn’t always close properly and it’s a pain to get perfect. The neighborhood isn’t even nice or particularly safe but at least the place is cheap.

They finally fixed it, but left two huge holes in the ceiling that they said they’d patch up and never did. They also left their pretty nice ladder at our place that they never came to pick up so we just left it outside for them.

There was only once where she didn't respond within 24 hours, because her boyfriend had been hospitalized. A really excellent landlord and we would have potentially stayed, but we became homeowners ourselves.

She lives out of state, but I was still surprised how responsive she was. But she is not a large property manager, and this was her personal home before moving on.

She was also very fair for the security deposit. My kids had dinged up the walls and the carpet, but she didn't charge for the walls because she was planning on painting for the next tenant, and only charged for a spot on the new carpet, but not the old, as that was going to be replaced as well.

Most of the rooms are about the size of a one door garage, so the over $1000 rent is frankly outrageous. The rooms do all have locks, and there are security cameras, however the other tenants still have on multiple occasions stolen other tenants' belongings or groceries, and the landlord has done little to stop it. Repairs are not done, period. There is mold in all of the bathrooms. The pool in the backyard has not been cleaned or uncovered in probably years, and there is a smashed and totaled car in the garage just sitting there. He appointed two house managers to take care of maintenance and nothing gets done. He stated on multiple occasions that he ""doesn't want to come over here"" to deal with issues and this is why nothing gets done.
Legally, a Mississauga house can have up to five tenants living in it. This house has at least nine at any given time. There were about eleven of us when I lived there. Neighbours complained and a fire marshal was sent to inspect the property. Jason instructed us to lie and lied to the fire marshal that there were five people living there and that anyone else was a ""guest."" I was there when the fire marshal came over, and I overheard him lying and saying that a tenant's room was empty and belonged to his brother. Clearly Jason is aware of the law and knows he is in violation of it and does not care about the safety of his tenants, he only cares about the money he receives.
Overall, Jason is a nice and friendly guy, but his general apathy about anything happening at his properties and the whole lying to city officials bit makes it impossible to recommend him as a landlord.",1,1,2,3,2

982,CERDA-ZEIN,OAKLAND,CALIFORNIA,94611,US,"Overall, they're alright (which is more than I can say for most realty companies). Their interactions with me have been respectful and prompt. They have fixed most of my repairs on time and are pretty responsive when it comes to problems. Most of the time they have reached out to me about appliances in my home within 24 hours and often send someone within a few days. One time I didn't know why my heater wasn't turning on and someone called me within 10 minutes to explain to me what I needed to change. A few things took longer than they should have (ex: getting a garage door opener took a month and I was unable to park my car in the garage and had to use street parking) but still, I am impressed with how they have handled most problems. 

The biggest issue has been communication between us and the property owners. Earlier this year, we needed to increase the security of our property because individuals kept breaking into the shared backyard common space and keying cars/destroying furniture/littering/smoking. It took a long time for Cerda-Zein to get back to us and to coordinate with the property managers to install better security measures.

986,ROBERTS REALTY,ST. LOUIS,CALIFORNIA,63105,US,"Roberts Realty owns most of the properties around WashU and frequently rents to students. In other words, they have a monopoly on a majority of undergraduate student housing and they know it.

When I first moved into a property I was renting from Roberts Realty the place was in shambles. There was a strange black mold that had infested a closet along with potential animal droppings and what appeared to be cat litter. One of the toilets was completely broken and continuously overflowed into the hallway. The previous tenants had left behind loads of furniture/dishes without our consent and Roberts Realty had failed to remove them prior to our move-in date. 

While we actually lived there, several horrible things happened. At one point, a bat flew in through the fireplace (which we thought had been boarded up) and it took 3ish days for them to send someone to remove it. So we basically lived with a bat flying around our home for several days and it would randomly jump out at us and fly through the hallway/our bedroom. On top of that, there was also a wasp's nest that formed right outside my window and it took several days for anything to happen, even though wasps were coming into my room. Several other repairs took a long time to fix and the general property was not in great condition. 

I decided to move out of the property and once again attempted to live with Roberts Realty. I found a new place in the spring of 2021 that they were renovating and was told it would be done within two months (by June 1st). However, June 1st came and went and they had not done anything to finish the renovations. They told me they would not be done until August/September, so I decided to leave and rent somewhere else. Sometimes I walk by that apartment and it is still not finished (I'm writing this in 2023). 

All in all, they have a monopoly in the area so people will continue to rent from them, but they are not a trustworthy company.",1,1,4,4,3
987,GOLDEN VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS,BAKERSFIELD,CALIFORNIA,93307,US,"The homes are great. When I moved in, everything was functional. Repairs are fast, the next day after reporting an issue most of the time. My issue is with the pest. There’s a huge roach issue all over Bakersfield and they come in from outside all the time! Most of the time they’re still alive so I know whatever they’re spraying outside isn’t working. For them to come in and die, you actually have to make a complaint about roaches. They’ll come and spray the most nausea inducing stuff that you have to leave the windows open for a couple of days and leave the house for a few hours when they spray which is horrible in the summer. The roaches are only a problem in the summer. 
The other issue is the rent. Since covid, the rent has jumped up to unreasonable prices. There have been shootings, cars have been broken into, some of the machines in the gym don’t work, and you have to make an appointment to use the common facilities. They try to justify it by putting in fountains and new foliage. They have hired more security BUT it’s just the same amount of security from before covid when they laid off a bunch of guards. For context, they have the same amount of guards as they did in 2018 when my rent was $900 as they do now when my rent is $1500 yet there is more crime in the community now. 
Also, I requested EV chargers 2 years ago and they promised they’d install them within a year. We still don’t have EV chargers.
In short, it’s hard to see where my money is going and for that reason, I feel it is extremely overpriced. If you have two incomes paying, I’d recommend it but otherwise, pay a little less for a place more in the city.

They ""forget"" to give out notices that result in people getting unexpectedly evicted without any warning, and lie to their tenants about things being ""okay"" telling them ""not to worry"" when notices are given.

My complex changed PMC while I was living there (and, in fact, it has changed since I left), AVC were a far cry better than the initial company. They put a lot of effort into renovating units as people moved out and encouraged existing residents to move into those newly-renovated units, but I never felt pressure to do so, nor was my rent increased enough to match the rates of those units. They built out a small dog park, parking for bicycles, replaced & rebuilt external walkways. The biggest issue for me is that when I called for service related to mold growing out of the vents of my HVAC, their on-staff technician only saw fit to replace the vent covers with new ones. Did nothing to allay my concerns that mold was likely growing in the vents. That was the motivating factor to leave the complex and live elsewhere. I also wish they would’ve done more to make the parking lot a bit safer & more accessible, but the geography & terrain of where the complex was built (right in the side of a relatively steep ridge) would make any effort there difficult, and we’d all have nowhere to park for weeks, so it’s hard to fault them for that lack of action.

When it was time to move out, due to our scheduling, we were unable to do a walk through. Then they charged us $400 for 'cleaning.' They wrote that the apartment was filthy, had stains on carpets etc.  (We cleaned the place so obsessively it was cleaner than when they gave it to us...) When I went to the office to ask for the paperwork that their employee signed to prove it was already like this, they said they didn't have it and that employee no longer worked with them. They asked if I had a copy.  No, the lady did the walk through in person, there was no opportunity to get a photocopy of the document and we didn't take a picture (naive college students). They knew this. They used us and were rude in person too.",1,1,1,3,1
1010,BORGER MANAGEMENT,WASHINGTON,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,20016,US,"Borger is easily the worst property management company I have rented from in this city since I moved here. The building I rented was 6 floors total with around 6 units on each floor and the laundry room had 3 washers and 3 dryers. The laundry room in question is absolutely heinous as well, regularly found cockroaches and rat droppings down there while waiting for my laundry. There was one elevator and it routinely went out, forcing everyone to take the stairs. The building was rent-controlled and had a majority of elderly or disabled tenants and the building still did NOTHING to fix the elevator permanently. The building has no mail room or any kind of security and is incredibly unapologetic about mail being stolen. In the time I lived there, I had friends have bridesmaid dresses, textbooks, and medicine stolen from the mail area and the building's only response was to say they will keep an eye out. A company that obviously looks for as many ways to tack on extra fees on their tenants just because they know they have those tenants trapped in their leases. An absolute sham of a company, cannot recommend avoiding them any stronger. I hope they FOLD financially.",1,1,4,3,1

1018,STRATFORD AT WILLIAMSBURG (THALHIMER),WILLIAMSBURG,VIRGINIA,23185,US,"Lived in Stratford Apts for 9 years. Pest control was done regularly, but getting repairs done in a timely fashion was a big problem. Our AC unit was fixed in under a week when it broke, but that was the only time something was done quickly. We had a kitchen drawer that broke during the pandemic lockdown. Despite several repair tickets, it was still broken when we moved out three years later. All the repairs that DID get done required multiple requests and calls to the office. There was a pretty bad roach infestation in our quad for about 3yrs, despite pest control and our own best efforts. When we moved out, we found black mold in the back corner of one bedroom. Mgmt is supposed to do regular mold inspections and air filter replacements. They didn't. But they did try to charge us a fee for noncompliance on our rental insurance because their third-party underwriter misplaced our paperwork, and they doubled the pet rent the final year that we were there. The rent is reasonable for the area and while we lived there it only increased by $50 or less each year, though the water and sewer bills varied wildly. There is one laundry room for each block and they're almost always full. Parking is also an issue, as many people have late-staying guests who take up spaces meant for residents, despite the parking stickers. For the most part, the landlords leave their tenants alone, but this also means they don't intervene when they probably should.
If you're looking for a nice quiet place to live for a few years, during military or academic residence for example, this is a decent place to live. For the most part, it's safe and clean, the units are pretty spacious, and the rent is reasonable. Just try to plan your laundry schedule well, get home early so you can find parking, keep roach gel under your sink, and don't expect much help from the landlords when something breaks.",2,2,4,5,4

So after living here for years and our rent being suspiciously lower then what other people expect despite it going up at the rate (sometimes less) of inflation every year confirms for me that we have a lot of favor with them and this colors our experience.  
This building has lots of old,  disabled, and POC. Myself included in some of those categories.  I wish they cleaned the elevator more often (or at all) and went back to their pre COVID package in the mail room policy (some stealing has happened). 
Biggest item of note in their favor is when we first moved here a bunch of places gave myself (black F) and my now spouse ( white M) different prices and credit score numbers despite us checking out locations together.  These same places would tell the same bold face lie about whether the over oven fan vents to outside. 
This place didn't lie and gave us the same numbers. The bar really low for this test but they are the only ones in town who passed it.

There was mold, the sinks and toilets would frequently back up with black water, and at one point a door to the outside had been damaged and was falling off its hinges, meaning that there was nothing to prevent people off the street from coming into the building. When we repeatedly reported these issues to the property manager, he literally LAUGHED IN OUR FACES. They required us to hire our own cleaning service when we moved out, and still tried to charge us a “cleaning fee” even though we had already paid one when we moved in, and paid out of pocket for the aforementioned cleaning service when the lease ended.

He asked me questions he knew I didn't know the answer to, and when I told him I didn't know, he would push me to answer anyway so that he could start a fight and call me a liar when I guessed wrong.

He also required my housemate and I to text him reminders about coming over for repairs instead of just. Putting a reminder on his dumb phone. He didn't bother to check that the furnace was actually working before we moved in and come winter we were wondering why the furnace was running constantly (producing a bill of over $400/month) and yet the apartment was so cold. He told us he would help us get our money back for that but surprise surprise he never did (because he half asses everything).

This hole was still leaking and filled with mold- we had to call a Toronto Health inspector to look at it to get them to cover it up. 

They initially covered it with a tarp and then patched it without fixing the roof, so it started to drip again. At no point did they offer us a different apartment to live in while this was fixed.

My roommate and I moved out because this was not a liveable space anymore. They were actually showing the apartment to other people, despite this damage to the ceiling and the roof, and I doubt that they warned the prospective tenants about the ceiling or roof issue.

When we refused to change the lease, she sent us an official letter that stated that she decided to move back in and so we had to move out.

He's a very nice and understanding fellow, doesn't have a problem with late rent as long as you let him know, and he adjusted rent down for me when I mentioned I was going to have to move out because I couldn't afford it. When repairs are needed, he gets to them quickly and has no qualms about hiring professionals when it's really needed, (as for roofing or plumbing), and actively takes preventative measures like repairing a roof before it needs it. 

That said, the seals on my windows were all failing, the building has a recurring mice problem although it's taken care of each time it pops up, half the floors were fucked (and none of the vinyl flooring was ever installed properly), some of my heaters didn't work, the drainage is poor, the clothes dryer vent installation is . . . probably a fire trap, and the walls and cabinets are all vaguely grimey even when freshly cleaned. 

I would recommend Tony as a landlord to any students out there, but once you're making money you'll probably want to find a better spot.

Doing the bare minimum to upkeep properties, while allowing them to essentially decay and crumble because there are never any renovations done. His maintenence guys are useless and I had to explain to them multiple times what was wrong with appliances and fixtures in our home before they could figure them out. Will charge you extremely high rates for things like cleaning and carpets, etc but does the bare minimum. our carpets were brand new and starting coming up from the thresholds within months.

1060,MAC PROPERTIES,CHICAGO,ILLINOIS,60615,US,"We'd heard some bad things about this management company so we were apprehensive about renting from them, but they've actually been just fine for us. (This is our experience and I'm sure others' have been different). Everyone in the offices is very kind and they have been highly responsive to maintenance requests and any other questions we've had. We've rented from them for 3 years now and have lived in one of their newer buildings and one of their older ones. Unsurprisingly, they responded more quickly to maintenance requests, etc. in the newer building, but we haven't waited very long (not more than 3-4 days not including weekends) for non-emergency requests even in the older building. When we first moved into the newer building, we needed an extra set of keys for the 3rd person living in our two-bedroom unit and they sent someone over to deliver them in person in less than 20 minutes! The unit we live in now is in the older building, and we've had some issues with mold, peeling paint, and water damage, but it's not the worst I've seen. When we first moved into our current unit the dishwasher was broken and they replaced it with a completely new one just a few days after we let them know. They have an online portal where you can pay rent and submit maintenance and management requests, and there's no extra fee for paying rent online. I believe most of their buildings are smoke-free and both buildings we've lived in have had shared laundry facilities on-site. When we moved out, we got our whole security deposit back and they let us move out on the 1st when our new lease began instead of forcing us to be completely out by the 31st. They are very pet friendly but there's a pretty steep pet fee ($350 fee + $30/month). They've also increased our rent quite a bit each time we've renewed. The company is definitely just after $$$ like any landlord, but the people who do the actual work in the offices and the buildings are friendly and for the most part very competent.",4,4,4,5,5

The ceiling constantly leaked and they refused to do anything to permanently fix the issue, in fact the handymen sometimes made the problems worse, once leaving a toddler sized hole in my bathroom wall not getting around to fixing it the rest of the time I lived there (causing my cat to get stuck in it). Plus, mice and roaches all over the place. 

Only a few months after I had moved in they announced that they were selling the house and opening it for prospective buyers to tour. One of these prospective buyers robbed my roommate and I of over 1500 dollars worth of stuff and JG did nothing, they didn't even stop sending people to tour the house without a realtor.  When it finally came time for us to move out they had prospective renters touring the house every day all hours of the day making it impossible for me to work from home and relax in my house, not to mention that the realtors were rude to me while they were invading my privacy.  They have a lot of properties in the city but I will never do business with them again after all the grief they put me through.

The landlord entered my property on multiple occasions without the required 24 hour notice, as well as without any notice at all.
Upon my move out, I gave proper notice, and made sure to leave the unit cleaner than when I moved in (even finding rent receipts from previous tenants under the fridge, which the landlord had said was cleaned before my move-in) he not only kept my damage deposit, but tried to charge me $4432 for my move out, along with keeping the lawnmower that he required me to purchase to mow his lawn.

I’ve had several problems with my water and air, I understand it’s an old building and maintenance issues are going to happen, but when I have no hot water and no cold air for months, it becomes a little exhausting. The maintenance people I’ve encountered for the most part have been very nice and I didn’t feel it dangerous to have them in my home. The rent has gone up over $100 in the short time I’ve lived here and there is no loyalty discount for renewing. It’s made very clear that the landlord company does not care about their tenants, or their employees who are majority students working to have their rent decreased. Everyone on the lower half of the ladder that actually interacts  with tenants is great, but the further up the corporate ladder you speak to, the more you feel treated like a financial investment and less like a human. In the past few months they started silently posting utility bills at odd times and then tried to charge me more for not paying them when I didn’t know they existed.

They responded to maintenance requests sometimes, but many serious issues with the house went unrepaired. For example, the electricity - the lights were often flickering. The message I heard was that they couldn't do anything about that. Also, there was black mold in the basement and a persistent roach problem. They served us a 30 days end-of-lease notice for no reason (the stated reason was that we hadn't been paying rent, but this was a lie, we were up to date on rent). (Also, they should've given us 60 days notice by law, but whatever.) In our attempts to reach them for clarification, it was incredibly hard to get through to an actual human being. It turned out they simply wanted to renovate and raise the rent. No idea if they addressed the maintenance issues we had tried to get help with. It mostly seemed like cosmetic renovations they had planned, like adding the gray fake wood flooring every apartment nowadays has, and replacing kitchen cabinets. Got to give them low ratings because they never addressed various issues that would have made the house more liveable; honestly that sort of thing was mostly taken care of by my housemates, doing the best we could do to work with things, considering we were renters and couldn't change anything too permanent or drastically... Given them a 3 for privacy because they didn't do anything probing into our personal lives, unless you count forcing us all to find new housing arbitrarily...

I’ve lived in Bowling Green for six years while attending college out here and the most trouble I’ve had with landlords has been while I was renting with Greenbriar. They have a pretty substantial monopoly on properties in this city and they treat their tenants like numbers on a screen rather than people. The folks working in their leasing office are very friendly but once you're leased, they are itching to find an excuse to evict you. A few years ago my roommate had an ESA, when she tried to turn in the paperwork for it they told her that they would accept it on a later date. A few weeks later we had an eviction notice on our door for pet policy violation that took two weeks of choppy communication to sort out. A few months ago they let themselves into my current house (they only notified one roommate, everyone else was unaware) to “bust” me for cat-sitting a friend’s cat for 5 days. They made us sign a paper to shorten our lease by 2 weeks and told us if they caught one more pet policy violation they would immediately evict us. A friend of mine tested the paint in her Greenbriar studio apartment for lead and found trace amounts. The only decent thing  about renting from them is the timely repairs but even then, their units often are cheaply built and maintained so you’ll likely need to place a lot of maintenance requests to keep your place from falling apart like I have.

The only real issues are a tendency to give ""24 hour notice"" by putting a note on the door at 1pm the day before an 8am visit from a technician, a rent payment system that has a tendency to 'accidentally' double charge (just don't set up autopay and you'll be fine). And the big one:

they added a ""utility surcharge"" three months after moving in that raised my effective rent by about $200/mo. It's a blatant money grab by the uncaring owners of the company, but apparently perfectly legal.

FEES and EVICTION were the magic words they loved to use to scare tenants, with random papers on your door even though you pay your bills on time. Staff are all in cahoots with management (if someone actually did their job they would be fired), you could never get a copy of your lease, something was always 'missing' in your paper work, and if they didn't file it on time they would try to evict you even though you submitted all the necessary paper work. There has been instances where staff actually foraged signatures for forms you never signed for to try and frame you to pay more. If the bad google ratings aren't enough, they also scrub negative reviews (with evidence) from various realtor sites and on google themselves. Security is a joke and so is safety.

It was an older property and things like the plumbing would mess up sometimes. Maybe twice since we lived there. Both times Evelin lied and tried to say it was caused by us the tenants and tried to make us pay for it. However, I spoke to the plumber and he confirmed both times that the pipes were old and that’s why it was easily clogged. He said every year this property needs him to come unclog for this reason. This was very much how Evelin managed the property. Anytime we needed something she would lie to try and have us pay for it. She also lied and said we had a dog living with us when we only had a cat. She tried to use this pretend dog to manipulate us into paying for stuff that the landlord was legally liable for because she was “doing us a favor.”  Finally when we moved out she kept the majority of the deposit and what little she paid us she sent late. She gave us an itemized list at our request and did the math wrong. So she owed us more according to her. We never saw that money because the courts were closed and I moved out of state. Not dealing with her was worth losing out on the money. Also, she used to show up randomly and stick her face in the screen door to look through my apartment it was super creepy.

It’s clear he bought a single family home, split it into as many units as possible, with as little effort as possible. Mr. Khan put as little effort into managing his property as he did actually turning the property into rental units - when we moved in it was clear the unit has not been cleaned between tenants, even though he assured us it would be. I cannot even describe the amount of grease that was caked on the inside of the oven and on the range hood and cabinets (we had to clean multiple times before it was safe to use without being a fire hazard) and when we pulled the appliances out to clean the floor behind them there was a carpet of mouse poop like the stove had never been moved and cleaned behind. Further, within a couple weeks of moving in we notified him that the dishwasher (which was included as a feature in the listing and noted on the lease) was not working properly. He showed up within a day or so, but then proceeded to push every button on the dishwasher until it finally ran on the delicates/China setting and said “see, it works.” Needless to say we were not impressed by this response and never used the dishwasher (partially because it was as filthy as the rest of the kitchen and could only clean on the gentlest setting).

When he did request access to the unit for various reasons (for inspections required for his mortgage, etc.) he would always request access less than 24 hours in advance. We were accommodating the first few times, but finally mentioned that he must give us proper notice to enter. 

Finally, every year he would come to us with a story about how he needed to increase the rent beyond the rental increase guideline for one reason or another (sounds like you can’t afford to be a landlord then).

I agree that the shortened hours suck, and most of the time, multiple machines are out of service. I once had a washing machine malfunction while I was in the middle of washing my clothes. I've dealt with all three landlords/managers, and they were all decent. My direct landlord is the nicest of them all to me. Anytime my apartment needed something to be fixed, it was done in was done within two days. If I had a concern with any neighbours, it would be dealt with the next day.

Fighting over the hot water is what sucks about living in an old and low-rise building. If a tenant in my building uses hot water in another apartment, I must wait until they finish.
However, I brought up my concern about something else (by sending a text and a photo), and the landlord didn't reply, which was a slight letdown. The situation concerns ""safety"" but not smoke detectors, mold, or pests.

There are two working washers and dryers for a building of over 20 people and most of the time, those machines breaks. We heard that another tenant’s personal property was stolen from the ‘secure’ laundry room that we had been advised was safe to store our bikes and other personal belongings and the landlords did nothing to help. On top of ALL of this, there’s a massive rat problem that they have tried to blame all the tenants for rather than admit there’s a hole in the foundation behind where they stack our garbage, allowing the rodents into the house. The only upside is the one maintenance man, Pino, who is always prompt and sweet when he comes to fix things.

The street adjacent to the complex is very dangerous to drive and walk on due to high traffic. When my previous upstairs neighbor was constantly loud and disruptive (I even suspected a DV situation) it took months until the situation escalated enough for the leasing office to care. The man would not only cause domestic disturbances but also drive and park his giant truck drunk through the parking lot. We would contact both the office and local authorities with our concerns, and it took the tenant's teenage daughter harassing residents from their balcony for something to actually be done about this tenant. To their credit, once the situation escalated enough he was kicked off of his lease early.

The house itself was really two apartments divided by covering over a door that should have connected the front & back halves. Construction was unstable - floor warping, walls sagging, chimney crumbling. Rent was decent (between $600 and $800  per month before the pandemic).  Residents were expected to take care of the lawn, garden and snow removal at own expense. Changed legal operation from paying him directly to  eHomz corporation without notifying tenants. Gas company shut off gas due to safety concerns. Landlord swore ""it was up to code if he got the right inspector"".  Rented out to anyone with only the most cursory of background checks.  Domestic disputes waking up whole neighborhood and drug use common.  The place is quieter since the pandemic ended, but still in horrible disrepair. Do no rent from eHomz Inc or Mansoor Vezvaie. They are slumlords seeking passive income and while polite through email, they will not care about you so long as they get their rent.",1,1,5,5,2

They barely have enough money to keep the elevators functional in the other buildings, let alone restore these abysmally built historic dormitories.

Their solution to this was to charge us for a valet trash service that didn't come by a third of the time and sometimes refused bags that I had weighed to make sure were within the weight limit.

My carbon monoxide detector — which is required *by law* to always be operational because I have a gas stove — was broken and it took them three business days to replace it.

Managers come off as passive aggressive when community complaints are submitted. Emails are unprofessional and constantly have typos or missing information that they have to follow through with in a secondary message, resulting in confusion.

The app the community uses is bordering on not operational. At least one form of payment for rent is consistently unavailable thanks to their app’s internal issues. The app cannot handle routine maintenance requests.

Half of the washing machines in the community washers are broken, and prices have been gouged to costing $2 for a single wash cycle. Pools were unavailable for two consecutive months at the beginning of summer. 3/4 pools are still unavailable at the penning of this complaint.

I have provided a snippet of an email from the landlords regarding the removal of some of the community landscaping below. Please note how unprofessional and impute their diction sounds. Please also notice the poor grammar:

“We have had several residents reach out to express their feelings on this project. While we understand the frustration in removing trees and the shade they provide, the decision to remove the tree’s if for the overall improvement of the community[...]Additionally, citrus trees attract several unwanted pests and rodents, and the fallen fruit on the ground is then walked on, tracked throughout the community and even into your homes. We are excited about the current and upcoming projects here at Omnia on Thomas and know that the improvements being made will only improve our community and make it more enjoyable for our residents.”

There were many needed repairs visible at my move-in inspection that I was told would be taken care of, and they never were in all of the years I lived there. On every annual inspection, I was berated by Mr. Joiner for these damages, and I had to point out every time that the damages existed when I moved in, and had never been fixed. When things broke while I was living there, repairs were either haphazard or non-existent. I had to argue with a repairman who was replacing a broken front doorknob to replace with the same kind (a handleset with a latch that affixes to the door in two places at the top and bottom); they had replaced it with a regular doorknob, leaving an open hole completely through the front door where the top handle of the old doorknob had attached. A full-sized microwave broke and was replaced with the most miniature microwave available; I couldn't fit a regular-sized plate in it. We had an under-counter trash compactor that broke a week before I was hosting Thanksgiving. Trash was still in it and it was stuck closed. I asked multiple times for a repair and was ignored; I had to pay someone myself to come get the terrible-smelling trash out before family came over. When I had the next annual inspection and asked Mr. Joiner to have this repaired or replaced, he said, ""Oh, they don't sell those anymore."" (I checked and they still sell them at Lowes today.) Mr. Joiner also came over for unannounced ""inspections"" when I was not at home and only my minor children were there. He scared my kids and told them they had to let him in, and they said he went in every room and took photos of everything. Very disrespectful.

While maintenance did come to fix it, it took 3 tries to get a fix that lasted more than a few days. Two years later, the toilet still gurgles. Communication between the landlord and their maintenance staff also seems poor. Maintenance uses a dumpster behind a large apartment building to dispose of large trash items, often filling the dumpster to the point where it is unusable by tenants. On one occasion they removed a tenant's kayak, which the tenant was keeping next to the house. They did not inform the tenant they would be doing this, or where they were taking the tenant's property, or when (or even if) they would bring it back.

Basically, if the building manager had to call someone else in for support, the wait times could be well over a week.  For the most part, I was happy in the apartment.  It was clean, quiet, and the management company's representatives were pleasant when I had to interact with them.

1172,FOUNTAIN LAKE APARTMENTS,BRADENTON,FLORIDA,34207,US,"As someone who holds a high standard of living, I was thoroughly appalled and utterly dismayed by my experience at Fountain Lake Apartments. The complex was plagued by a persistent homeless problem, with beggars constantly pestering for change and loitering around the property, creating a perpetual nuisance and a glaring safety concern.

To add insult to injury, the amenities at Fountain Lake Apartments were woefully lacking. A meager offering of a single pool, a cramped and outdated gym, and a pickleball court hardly qualifies as luxurious living. Shockingly, there wasn't even a playground for children, leaving families with little to no recreational options. Considering the exorbitant rent prices, the glaring lack of adequate amenities was nothing short of inexcusable.

It became abundantly clear that the management's priorities were severely misplaced, with a blatant focus on profit rather than ensuring a quality living experience for residents. The persistent homeless problem, pervasive water damage issues, and absence of amenities beyond the bare minimum of a pool, gym, and pickleball court all pointed to a flagrantly neglectful management team.

In all honesty, I cannot in good conscience recommend Fountain Lake Apartments to anyone seeking a truly upscale living experience. The utter disappointment and frustration I experienced during my tenure were unparalleled. Prospective residents would be wise to steer clear of this mismanaged, amenity-deprived, and homeless-ridden complex, and instead seek out a well-maintained and amenity-rich living environment elsewhere.",1,2,1,3,1

As you can expect the problem only got worse even though we moved all the food to the highest cabinets and made sure everything was super sealed. Months in the entire building had them and we eventually found out they were coming in through the walls from another apartment. They should have taken the problem more seriously rather than blame the tenants. Overall this wasn't a bad place to live but the last few months were pretty unbearable from all the drilling and construction they were doing on the balconies. They were literally drilling into the brick in the side of the building (it was deafeningly loud) and we had to leave most days just to protect our ears (the workers all had proper ear protection but we were hearing the full force of it). We were honestly worried about the real chance of hearing loss, not to mention the constant barrage of noise took a toll mentally.

He said that because *he* didn't smell it (either he has no sense of smell or he was lying, it was omnipresent), it wasn't worth checking out. The oven only got replaced because he *stuck a lighter in it* after I challenged him on his dismissal and it flared.

I have good neighbours, a lower housing charge than I could possibly get outside the co-op environment, and a unit that provides me and my family far more for our money than is available in rental buildings in the neighbourhood. Our volunteer board and committees work hard to ensure our co-op functions in the memberships best interest, and our office staff are efficient and diligent, often dealing with very difficult situations, attitudes and expectations. As a long term member, I'm impressed with how well our co-op runs, and how much positive change has occurred in the last few years. Many upgrades have been applied to our units and the buildings as a whole. We have low vacancy rates, repairs are dealt with quickly, and pest control is addressed far more proactively than in the past. Of course, it also depends on the members allowing this work to occur, and accepting that there will be inconvenience attached. 

No living arrangement is perfect, but our co-op is by far a better place to live than most rent-based buildings. We know our neighbours, share a belief in affordable housing and a mutual responsibility for our home and environment. Most of us in this co-op know how lucky we are to have this space downtown in a busy city - generally lower than 'market rent', member volunteers who are willing to give their personal time to co-op business, and an office staff that continues to function well regardless of pressures exerted by a few discontent member, many of whom struggle with life's challenges.

We had an agreement that we were gonna rent with her and already moved in, we didnt sign a lease at that point because we had a roommate agreement with a previous tenant that was moving out. We were working on finalizing a lease but kept sending illegal leases. We were trying to negotiate.

Then one day she sends us an email stating that we needed to vacate in Two Days otherwise she would get police involved.

We were incredibly confused and the reason why we needed to leave changed over 3 times, she came over and threw out our things in the common area into the rain, damaging them.

She also came without notice often. One time she did and shoved my roommate while yelling at him it was her house and he needed to leave. I wasnt home at this time but he recorded it and got it on other cams too, we put up cameras in the common area because we were fearful of her. She her clothes off and exposed herself to him too, the family member with her called the police and she tried to tell them that he assaulted her. After showing police the footage they escorted her off property.

Because we only had the roommate agreement with previous tenant and werent able to get a legal lease with her, we had no rights and she took advantage of this. For 3 months she promised we would continue to live there, then suddenly switched. We tried going to LTB about it but due to lack of lease we were told to vacate, despite her harassment and the previous agreement.

We had to leave without getting our last month deposit back.

They lost our mail keys so mail delivery is hit or miss and I can only get my prescriptions mailed to me so that’s been a pain. When they have work done to “improve” the building they take our assigned parking with no warning. They just replaced the carpets in the hallways and now there is no sound dampening, and our front doors aren’t sealed well so noise from the hallways went from bad to awful. They’re adding parking fees, pet rent, and a credit reporting fee to our leases, which I understand are common but it’s frustrating to have to pay more on top of how expensive the rent is. I’ve had some maintenance done in our apartment and they don’t try to schedule with you until day of and text and call you asking if they can come in - some of us work outside of the home and I’ve asked multiple times to schedule a time that works for me instead of just springing it on me and that hasn’t happened yet.

Maintenance was responsive at first, but when more persistent issues presented (i.e. the bathroom light going out, water pressure in the shower diminishing to a trickle), it took us several days and more than one attempt at communication w/ maintenance and the property manager to actually see a maintenance person. More so, those problems would continue after being “fixed”, so we would have maintenance out at least twice a month on average. The apartment was not especially clean and we had to have a few things replaced, such as a moldy cupboard door; overall pretty cheaply put together; landlord specials galore. Found some overlooked old chili peppers(??) on a bathroom shelf when doing a deep clean. Had to figure out a method for using the oven without burning food to a crisp. Showered in the dark for at least a week due to aforementioned light going out and not actually being fixed. Mail was frequently missing or misplaced due to the mailroom not being organized and (I assume) ineffective communication w mail carriers (I would recommend a P.O. box if you live here, unless you’re okay w your mail being thrown wherever). A bike was stolen from the laundry room at one point. Laundry services cost about $1.75 per full cycle, but more if the machine eats your quarters, which it sometimes does (not a huge issue for them I’m sure because hey, more money!) Once tried to charge me $20 which they dropped when I disputed it - apparently they also didn’t know what they were charging me for. Charged me a $100 pet deposit for a hedgehog (an animal about the size of a shoe, if you’re unfamiliar).

This is an apartment where other tenants were constantly dumping couches and other furniture at the trash can and I think they thought that I wouldn't notice if they tried to charge me for it because we did know it was an ongoing issue. They did remedy the situation when I asked them for proof in the form of an itemized breakdown, because I obviously would never have done something like that. Also there were exactly two washers and dryers and one of each was constantly broken, so it was like an Olympic sport trying to get clean clothing for work. Someone was also murdered in my exact parking spot one day while I was out grocery shopping and when I came back the space was covered in blood and the police were cleaning it up which was very disturbing to say the least, but I did know that I didn't live in the best part of town.",1,3,5,5,1

1193,THE ATHENS REAL ESTATE COMPANY,ATHENS,OHIO,45701,US,"Honestly my time renting from this company was a nightmare. It took 5 months for them to replace the fridge that didn't seal properly and caused all my food to go bad so fast. The owner of the property (not the rental company) used a key to get into my house without warning or sending an email. Once the owner of the house and the owner of the company came to my apartment to ""look around"" and did not send an email beforehand to warn me. Repairs on the house were done without warning, which meant there were maintenance men in my house when I was unaware or unprepared. I lived in a garage apartment at the time, so I was in the backyard of renters in the house in front of me . When I toured the property, they told me that we had a shared driveway. New people moved into the house in front of me and they were never told there was someone living in an apartment in their yard, let alone that they had to share their driveway ??? Before they moved in there was some guy over to clean out the house and he literally took trash and scrap and bricks and cinder blocks and piled them up behind my apartment instead of getting rid of them. 

I spent so much time making that apartment look nice, I repainted, I cleaned out this boarded up structure behind the property so it could be a little outdoor patio, I planted flowers. I cared about where I lived! But the windows never sealed properly, I could literally fit my finger between the window and window frame - letting all sorts of weather and bugs in. The front door also never sealed properly. I had an issue with the kitchen sink not draining that took them over a month and a half to fix, meanwhile I was doing all my dishes in the bathtub ?? The maintenance guy was really nice, but he said that the company only allows repairs to be done within $100 so things just couldn't be fixed properly.

They don't care about renters here. Any problems you bring up won't be dealt with before your lease is up and then they have no obligation to.",2,3,3,1,3

1201,TERRY SIELMAN,LONDON,ENGLAND,N22 8PP,GB,"We rented from him in London, but at the time he owned at least 7 properties around the country. The flat was badly ventilated and had serious mold problems - including wet patches on the walls and black mold. At one point the ceiling was literally dripping and he said it was because the bedroom window hadn't been kept open overnight (not only was it the middle of winter, but the idea that one person asleep could cause that much condensation is ridiculous). His answer to the mold was to paint over it - he did this just before we moved out so we made sure to warn anyone viewing about it, otherwise they'd have been caught out like we were. We also had mice, despite leaving no food open/at floor level. He blamed this on the flat below (which he also owned) and just told us to get traps.

He would turn up with no notice or warning, and if he turned up at the door and you went back inside for something he would just follow in without permission and start looking around. Once he put a piece of paper under the door at 7am saying he was coming over and then rang the bell at 10am - he then claimed that he had left the note there the day before and we had just missed it for 24hrs.

He was impossible to get ahold of most of the time - he would go on holiday and turn his phone off. This meant any urgent repairs just had to wait. When you got through to him, he would DIY the repairs, which would usually need redoing in a few months (we had to call him about the pipes under the bath leaking through to the downstairs neighbours three times in a year).",2,1,4,1,2

STILL can’t do laundry at home.  Also, the house did not have a CO detector, and we had to buy one ourselves.  The rental agency was supposed to do house inspections every few months, but they never did; they also had a habit of showing up without warning or sending emails to let us know they’d been there after the fact.

These apartments seemed safe, secure, and “reasonable” at its price for the type of commodities you got. Most of these apartments offer dryer/washer plus individual garages. These apartments were great at the start of 2020, given rent was around the vicinity of $1500 for a 2 bed 2 bath Apt with garage included. However, the state of some of the units was questionable, with a number of leaks and repairs that seemed to never end. Mold would grow due to these leaks, and it seemed the office would only care about fixing the problem temporarily. The staff was friendly and I’d even say professional to an extent. The only downside is that they engaged in practices that diminished the diversity of the people living there. In other words, they engaged in raising rent prices, changing policies, and even rejecting people that did not fit the profile the office wanted as tenants. By the end of 2022, rent for a 2 bed 1 bath was $1800~. Most of the neighbors who would be listed under minority status, including our family, were targeted by these changes in order to kick us out. The complex started “renovating” units and using lame excuses to justify why a lot of the older and mixed race tenants where simply moving out. Our case was no different. These people have no sympathy, no respect, and no understanding of how hard it is to sustain a livable wage under this economy. Do NOT rent here, it’ll be a waste of time and money. There are way better places that’ll be more reasonable than this complex, and quite frankly, a lot safer. They are lucky they haven’t been sued.",2,3,1,2,2

She repeatedly harassed me on text. She told my son to leave the premises or she would call the police and this in front of witnesses. She physically assaulted me on video (charges were pressed) and the prosecutor accepted the case and we await a trial date.

She was ordered by the tribunal du logement to repay the security deposit, then turned around and sued the tenants for 3 times the amount (she lost that case). $2000 rent for a luxury apartment and she llegally rents the other units on Airbnb.

Which they ignored entirely, pleading to ""give them the benefit of the doubt as they were new landlords"" 

As COVID ramped up in April, we found out from the upstairs tenants that B and T had agreed to rent the entire house to them come June when our lease would be up. But we had already signed another year renewal. B and T asked us to go month to month or just move in June, to which we said no. 

After this they became increasingly hostile, refusing any work on the house citing ""a lack of money, due to doing so many repairs to the house"" Calling us frequently to accuse us of causing damage we had proof existed when we moved in. Once threatened to call the police saying I was ""harassing her"" when I called in a noise complaint about the upstairs tenants. Even going so far as to tell us they ""talked to their lawyer and our days were numbered"" 

One day they show up unannounced for a ""safety inspection"" but it was clear they were searching for something. After ten minutes she took several photos of one of our smoke detectors and left. 

The next day B evicted us due to a dead battery in one of the detectors. We were given FIVE DAYS to vacate, and an optional court date to contest with the tenancy board. We decided to decline because after speaking to a lawyer we were told ""you will likely lose, the tenancy board often favors landlords, and if we fought and lost we would be blacklisted and have extreme difficulty renting in the future, and that even if we won, it would still go on our rental record and we would likely still struggle renting in the future.

She will harass you and talk down to you and laugh and yell right infront of your small children and say that you’re a bad parent while doing so. Threatens to call loved ones and discuss your business you have with her as one of her many scare tactics. Asks you to request money from government assisted organizations so that she can “have a little extra cushion in the bank”. If she’s upset with you she’ll withhold vital services from you and yourchildren. Calls child services with false and extremely concerning accusations. The list goes on and on.

There is mold in our kitchen that needs to be fixed with ventilation, a clear health hazard, that has simply not been fixed at all.

1241,INTEGRITY REALTY,CLEVELAND HEIGHTS,OHIO,44106,US,"Integrity isn't always super timely on repairs and work orders (took us 3 months to get some light bulbs replaced) because of only having about 6 maintenance workers for its 40 buildings (numbers given by a maintenance worker). They're supposedly better than others in our area, but are also quick to send out eviction notices when rent isn't paid exactly on time, despite the fact that many tenants are college students and/or first time renters who don't know how this works very well yet. They also don't give the properties many dumpsters despite the huge amount of tenants and buildings, so many nearby buildings share dumpsters and overflow them regularly. The neighborhood has trash all over because of cheaping out on waste disposal and lack of recycling bins, meaning that many leave recycling boxes of their own in on the side of the road, not having anywhere else to put them but the trash, leaving the wind and rain to ruin them and spread them across the street. 

Laundry is another big issue in these properties. I have to pay $2 for each wash and each dry, while some units in my building have washing machines already in their unit. We said we wanted one of these and that it was a deal breaker, but our first apartment didn't have this and it was too late to get another one by the time they told us so. We later moved to a new building, had the same request, calling it a deal breaker, and they sold the unit we wanted out from under us after saying we could go for it. Laundromats are pretty expensive, some of the older laundry units operate by coin only, and it depends on the building whether you have coin, Bluetooth app, or loadable card-based currency for the units. Our first building had one washer and one dryer in the basement, coin operated, for a whole building of 16 two bedroom suites, so probably 32 or more tenants who had to collect quarters to pay $1.75 per wash and dry, fighting over the single washer and dryer in the basement.

1243,ROGER DEVERILL,HEREFORD,ENGLAND,HR40HF,GB,"During our tenancy, we had few issues but he was extremely hands off, good for privacy but problematic in other ways. He was very hesitant to communicate over emails, always wanting phone calls, which we didn't realise until afterwards was a method of avoiding documentation of his actions.

During the 2.5 year tenancy, he increased the rent price by over £250. This was despite us losing access to the basement of the property due to flooding.

He was fast to authorise maintenance, but would leave all the work to you, including contacting the contractors in the first place. If the contractors didn't respond, you were stuck, as he would simply insist that you contact them again until they did.

Upon moving out, he demanded that the carpets be professionally cleaned, despite the fact that this is now illegal to do, and is not required as long as they are in the same condition as when the tenancy began. He also stated that when we were to pay the final utilities bills, we were not to give the companies his address or contact details, and threatened issues with our deposit if we were to do so. Realising that this was very suspicious, we demanded that he put this in an email, which he only did after repeated prompting, and which consisting of a single line from his personal email address, not even signed off with his name.

He refused to return our deposit citing the previous carpet cleaning cost, as well as other cleaning and repairs required. He refused to share evidence of this through the check out inspection report, despite recommendation from the inspection company that he should do so. When I refused to release the deposit to him, he also refused to use the deposit protection companies arbitration system. Due to my lack of interest in taking it to court, and presumably his knowledge that he would surely lose of it did go to court, the money has now been tied up with the deposit protection company for the 6 months since we moved out.",4,2,2,5,2

The dude's insane. He and his wife have had the cops called on them regularly both in their home and around town. By the way, the apartment is a duplex with his. Also, he was the pastor of a church in town and was fired in '92 when he was caught, tried for, and found guilty of sexually assaulting a minor after getting her drunk. The Northampton Police Know Who He Is and I think we all know why he's not on the known sex offenders list. He should not be allowed to rent this place out.

I'm also not convinced that it was a legal abode in the first place, he may have slapped A and B on the front the front room was definitely at one time a closed-in porch. That room doesn't have any insulation whatsoever and cannot safely be inhabited in the winter at night. There's a door from the patio into that room separate from the front door and it is literally the same $10 indoor-only door as used inside. It got down to fifteen degrees in there and we had to pile clothes in front of it so that it didn't leak in more.

He does all the repairs and let himself in SEVERAL times without knocking or setting a time. He used his key. I worked at home and sometimes he would barge in and demand that I talk to him about repairs I requested, each time telling me about how gracious he was for doing them. Some of those times I was in the shower or indecent. One time he opened the window to our bedroom while I was naked. I honestly don't know if he knew or not, which for me makes it even worse.

Technically legal, but scummy, and speaks to the uselessness of landowners in society etc.

Other then that, they did a bad job at making sure there was enough parking, but being a corporate landlord you at least got your amenities and repairs sorted out okay.

The big kicker to remember is that Irvine Company owns, essentially, almost all the apartments in the city of Irvine and thus has control of rent across the board. 

And since you're likely looking for a review because you plan on going to school at UCI: they know you have tuition money and they're completely fine with taking as much of it as they can. You're not getting the security deposit back in all likelihood (that was my experience and the experience of a lot of my friends.) At least if you do student housing that money sort of goes back to the school.

Oh also look up Donald Bren, the CEO (or president, whatever) and take a look at how UCI named the CS college after him because of some donation. If you're into math, calculate how much he makes from his properties and check it against the donation. I'm pretty sure he got his name on the school for a proportion of his wealth that you or I would use to buy a sandwich (like a nice sandwich, your favorite sub).

I'd still say I had a great time living there because of the proximity to the college and the great view of the trail out my window! A bit expensive though!

1282,VILLAGE POINTE,NORTHRIDGE,CALIFORNIA,91325,US,"Village Pointe management is organized and timely with repairs and inspections. The property is kept clean, and security is generally pretty good. However, they charge steep rent for cheaply made, small, and plain white apartments. Additionally, the rules listed in the lease are very restrictive. 

These poorly insulated apartments reach absurdly high temperatures in the summer, and only some rooms in some units have AC. Installing your own unit is a massive ordeal as management must approve of every step even if it's a very simple window unit with no screws or bolts. 
The pool essentially exists to look pretty and soak in. Any parties, music, food, floats, frisbees, water pistols, and even pool toys are forbidden. 
Management also heavily restricts what you can put on your balcony. Tenants are not allowed to use their balconies as storage, nor can they use any type of privacy screen like bamboo or lattice. Bird feeders and bird houses are also forbidden, which has lead to large numbers of bugs that management unsuccessfully tries to treat with pesticides. 
Smoking is allowed but it must be done indoors with all doors and windows closed. Management would prefer that you hotbox your roommates instead of a passing neighbor catch a whiff of any smoke. Despite their apparent commitment to reducing smell, the whole complex reeks of dog urine. This is because many dogs will continue to pee on the same spots that then never get manually rinsed off. 

There are definitely worse apartment complexes to live in, but they charge a lot of money for a place you aren't allowed to actually *live* in.",4,3,4,2,1

The whole building is the definition of slum land lord housing, nothing was ever cleaned and there were bugs even in the dead of winter. I had ticks on my BED in the middle of winter. The window fell out of the frame onto my dad when he tried opening it when I moved in. The landlord lied about the unit having ac so when I moved it I was totally caught off guard. You can’t adjust the thermostat and they have it set to like 90 so you’re sweating to death in the middle of winter. It’s so bad the floorboards were warped and if you stood in front of the vent you’d get burnt. The laundry machines barely work and it gets expensive quick. OH almost forgot, they don’t plow the parking lot in Syracuse in winter so I was shoveling/salting the apron for the lot so I could get to class entirely with my own money and time. They send no warning when trying to lease out your unit for the next school year and I had people trying to enter my room when I was hosting an event on zoom. Then they couldn’t understand why I refused to let them in my unit. Honestly the worst experience in my life.",2,1,4,2,5

After a pipe burst over the winter and soaked through 3 floors, the mold and water damage was never properly treated or compensated for. We were given an industrial dehumidifier to keep for two days and then we were by all means on our own. The water damage also damaged our electricals and the smoke detectors would go off randomly at night because of it. They wound up getting removed and we were without smoke detectors for.

While they are quick to respond to repair requests, the quality is quite shoddy: Loose fixtures, improper ventilation, and unfinished rooms. While the majority of the house is serviceability habitable, we recently learned of a potentially life threatening issue in the half done construction and the company's response wasn't to fix the issue but to sidestep it with what amounts to a bandaid.

We signed a rental agreement which explicitly stated that pets were okay. When we reached out about adopting a cat after living there for about a month, she insisted we needed to live in the property for at least 6 months before we could have a pet. She often made a point to tell us how expensive being a landlord was, and even took time once to come over and tell us she hadn't bought shoes in ten years and that was why we could not have a pet. In spring of 2017 we reached out to let her know about some peeling paint in the bathroom of the apartment, and upon her inspecting it were told we had 60 days to vacate the property so she could do repairs (but that it would be ideal if we could do it in 30).

Our furnace has had issues in the winter before and they've always come out and fixed it the day we reported the issue.  They do expect us to replace our own smoke detector batteries and to take care of minor pests like the occasional mouse.

Pet rent is relatively low (an extra $15/month) but they do require a refundable deposit of $300 and that you to pay for carpet cleaning before moving out.  Otherwise pretty decent about pets, including fish and larger dogs.  They also have no issues with you putting small holes in the wall to hang paintings or for anything else you might need a hole for.

The parking lot has narrow parking spaces and lacks sidewalks up to the main road, an area thats regularly traversed due to the apartment being across the street from the orange line. I harp of the out of date aesthetics and the poor parking lot because of a poll they sent out asking the tenants if they would use a electric car charge station. Their priorities seem to be a little out of touch. They also turned a laundry room into a storage unit which I ended up renting only for them to take all of my storage out and put it in the dumpster.

The roof leaked from the time I moved in in 2019 to when I moved out in 2021. There was a persistent issue with roaches and mice that the landlord was aware of but was never totally addressed. George, the landlord, relied on one of his children primarily to handle maintenance and repairs, to mixed results. He was usually prompt about making repairs (aside from the leaky ceiling). He wasn't great at privacy, often not providing the 24 hours that the lease stipulated before stopping by the apartment for things like pest control and inspecting water damage from the leaky roof, which was especially disruptive during the height of pandemic lock downs. He also frequently commented on how much repairs to the roof cost, despite the repairs never seeming to address the leak issue. When we moved out, it appeared that the water damage from the leak was just painted over. 

That said, the rent didn't increase over the 2 years I lived there. George as well as his son who did maintenance were very friendly and kind whenever they spoke to us. When our hot water heater went out, they were out to replace it within 4 hours.

He was informed and told us he couldn't do anything and when the pipes finally burst and we had to turn off the water he tried to make us wait for days before sending anyone to fix it. We stayed because rent was fairly cheap for the location when we first moved in, but as soon as rent in the area began to drop he hiked it up with less than a months notice and lied to us about the local market.

She lied about being resident in Toronto - she absconded to BC and made her tenants shovel the walk and take out the rubbish. She failed to install a lock on the front door, the windows were broken, she lied about a/c in the unit working. There was mold throughout the apartment. Anytime I asked for repairs she always made an excuse. When I complained she said move out if I wasn’t happy. Thank god I did but it was hard and not planned and financially broke me.

Most repair requests were ignored, or would happen months later. We had only one burner to cook on because the stove was broken, for example. There was a months long drama between the landlord and the tenant, and I believe this led to an unjust eviction. Ronan tried to keep our deposit, and only sent it when I 1) asked for an itemized list and 2) sent proof that many fix requests were ignored. He lied to us that he was selling the building and so we found another place to live — i think he just wanted to update the apartment to raise the rent, which he did with another unit.

1309,MONARCH APARTMENTS,JOHNSON CITY,TENNESSEE,37604,US,"Absolutely horrible. Management is controlled by a corporate overhead instead of left up to onsite management so big problems pile up. Management tells us verbatim that they cannot do anything until cooperate approves and the best they can do is email blast or put up flyers asking the residents to fix things. Examples are, Dog poop is left everywhere trash piles up everywhere.  
Rent is raised seemingly whenever they please as cooperate is in charge and not at the local level. Which is telling because all residents are college students, most of them international students or students living with a very small income each month. Tenants are bribed with gift cards to give good ratings on google. Won’t let you break lease and sub leasers have to have a broken lease 3 months prior to subletting. Walls are thin and it reaks of weed 24/7. Next to train tracks and there’s nearly a monthly shooting but rent is contained to be raised. Takes advantage of college kids who don’t know any better to not look for leasing other places and the fact that other places fill up months in advance and students need a place to live before school begins. 
Doors are flimsy at best and safety gates are just now being installed after multiple shootings and stabbings. During the summer the parking lot and pool fills up with strangers wanting to use the on-site pool and dangerous and rowdy drinking takes place. the system seems to not care that 90% of them are underaged.

There were frequent issues with pests, but pest control was only contacted once and they never followed up. Our intercom didn't function, despite having numerous people supposedly come to look at it. Communication with the property managers was a pain as it took a very long time to hear back from them, even when the situations were urgent, like the leak somewhere in the building that resulted in the paint bubbling out from the walls in the living room. The heat also didn't function properly and there was no temperature control in the suite. The noise was also unreasonably loud - both from other tenants in the building and from outside. We were never given notice about when landscapers would be on the premise which meant that I was frequently woken up by people standing in the window well outside my bedroom doing I don't know what.

We were not offered any compensation or hotel stays for the days the apartment was legally unfit for habitation.

I gave Jack Kohl a 1 for health and safety because our apartment had outdated electrical work that the electric company told us was unsafe, in a basement that had severe flooding, and Jack Kohl refused to update it. Our lights would flicker constantly. When handymen showed up to fix an issue, these workers completely blocked our main exit with no warning for an extended period of time, and when they were ""finished"", left rusty nails in the parking lot. 

I gave a 3 for stability because we had no experience regarding unreasonable rent increases or evictions.

I gave a 1 for privacy because while a friend was renting from Jack Kohl, they often tried to show her apartment without advance notice, or very short notice; once or twice they told potential tenants to just drop by and look around with no agent present. 

I gave a 1 for respect due to all of these things, and also, when I was finally able to obtain my actual landlord's phone number on my own (not from Jack Kohl property management) he yelled at me and threatened me over the phone.

By the time I had vacated, the managers changed their story, and told me that I only needed to pay the rent I owed in order to stay at my apartment. I had already moved into a different living situation and couldn’t afford to cover two rentals. This meant that I had in essence broken my lease, and now am in almost $8000 in debt, because of the management’s inability to explain why they were forcing a first-time renter to vacate their apartment.",4,4,2,4,2

For the most part they respond promptly to repair or maintenance requests, but often those repairs are incomplete or done to the bare minimum. The smoke alarm in my apartment has been detached from the ceiling since I moved in in summer 2021, and it has never been fixed despite several reports. They also don't seem to manage a lot of properties in my part of Philly, so we rarely feel like a priority. One area where they could really improve is in communication. Off and on throughout 2021 and 2022 we had issues with our fire panel malfunctioning, causing a noisy alert to go off without stopping. Whenever it was reported, the reps in the office would simply say it was a system issue and offer no suggestions to quiet the loud beeps. Their office staff seems to have a lot of turn over, and the folks I've spoken with often seem unsure how answer many simple questions (like who should be called about emergency maintenance). They also failed to communicate with the trash and recycling company they hired, so for several weeks the company could not access the alley where the trash is kept. They also write things into their leases that are a bit troubling, such as tenants being 100% responsible for things like pest control and plumbing repairs and lightbulb replacements (despite my unit having recessed lighting and 10 foot ceilings).",2,3,2,4,3

During that time, they entered the apartment while no one was home and without informing us that they were coming. They were supposed to come the next day, but insisted that we had the wrong date. When we moved out, they sent texts saying that we did things that violated the lease (using nails and screws for artwork, and shelves, peel & stick wallpaper)- even though they have been in the apartment before and saw it and never said anything, and there was nothing about that in the lease.

We did get a few mice during the winter. 

My gripes are around intrusions. When we first moved in, the upper unit had no access to the basement (while we did)— our second year the company essentially ripped up our private storage space to allow the other residents access to the basement. Our personal space was reduced but our rent was not. 

Secondly they handle lease renewals weird. Everyone (regardless of when you signed your original lease) is expected to renew in October. If you don’t renew then, your unit will be showed until you move out (or finally decide to renew at any point during the rest of the year). We and our dog were expected to be out of the house for a couple of hour window whenever the unit was showed; this was always during the workday and was a great disruption to work.

1374,ARBORVIEW / THE PINES,PORTSMOUTH,NEW HAMPSHIRE,03801,US,"Every person I spoke to when I lived here said the same thing: “The management just does not care.” Unless you are willing to spend a lot of time chasing after requests/inquiries, it’s likely that you will be forgotten/lost in the mess. I know someone who has had the same leaky roof problem for about 3 years now, and every time it rains more bits of the ceiling fall. Management/facilities are completely aware of this, and yet it has never been fixed.

We had TWO major appliance malfunctions within a span of about eight months, and both times this required us packing up our whole apartment and moving across the lot to a new unit. Huge cost to us & extremely inconvenient for us and family who kept dropping things to help. We got apologies and the rent stayed locked at its initial rate, but there was never any discount or additional consideration given to our situation. That’s the thing — management is super nice whenever you talk to them face to face, but actually useless when it comes to effective problem-solving.

There is only one laundry building with about a dozen machines for quite literally hundreds and hundreds of people to share, because they never constructed the second laundry location they announced over a year ago.

Leases are only offered annually, and the rent always increases by at least a few hundred dollars. No month-to-month option. I would never choose to go back there.",1,3,2,4,3

Management illegally towed a car from its paid for parking spot. People defecated in stairwells and common areas regularly, and management would hide this information from tenants. Mold was ignored and not repaired. Every time maintenance came to fix something, they would create more problems resulting in follow up maintenance requests.

1378,STARLIGHT INVESTMENTS- PROPERTY MANADED BY TRIVEST,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M5P 3H5,CA,"I lived in a building for 4 years prior to it getting sold to Starlight and then the duties of property management were done by a third party called Trivest. Immediately a ton of turn over in older tenants who had been living there for more than 6 + years. I found out when one the tenants was leaving they were offered a ton of money to leave. Then the never ending construction on empty units began. They left the back door to our building propped open, which was a fire code violation, but they didn't want to have to figure out how to ensure security for the whole building while the construction guys worked. This is an older building, that needed a lot of work, but they were only interested in cosmetic work to justify raising rents. The renovated units were fine, but with no real material changes to amenities, so no AC/or improved wiring for electricity. How to justify charging close to $2000 for a junior one bedroom is unbelievable. COVID hit and the provincial government put a work stoppage to construction work like rental unit reno's. The property management company did renovations anyways. Many of the workers never wore masks. And when you asked the building/landlords/property management they did not seem to care or understand what the issue was. Construction would happen till 8 PM at night in some of the units. To top it all off the turn over was high, so it was no surprise in our last year of living there, our unit got bed bugs. When scheduling to move day, I reserved the back alley for our moving truck on the appropriate day. The day of our moving arrived and construction workers were out in the back alley refusing to move. Prior to their purchase, our building had a real community feel, everyone knew everyone, and we looked out for each other.

Several units have been rented to new tenants without working HVAC or hot water and no plans to repair said issues. Repairs take anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months because the company only hires out of state contractors for anything major. When I moved in to my unit, the hot water heater had a supply pipe that was crimped/bent into a 90° angle, severely limiting the availability of hot water. This took around 2 months to get serviced. The walks in the winters are never cleared promptly, leading to several of my elderly neighbors falling and slipping in the ice and snow. The rental company also has an impressively restrictive tenant handbook that is currently under investigation by Montana Fair Housing. This handbook limits behaviors such as wearing ""pajama"" bottoms to enter the office while paying rent, chatting with neighbors on the sidewalk, putting up dog gates on your patio, changing your own oil, having a flat tire, having plants on your patio, ect... the list goes on.",1,3,2,3,3

No matter the problem, emails, texts, and calls are never answered in a timely manner, the super never comes when he says he will, and the property supervisors' response is disorganized and insufficient.

We have experienced many lapses in our hot water, broken heating during the winter, brown water from the faucets, water damage, mold, a lobby that reeks of cigarette smoke, theft from the package rooms, infestations of bugs (the exterminator told us he believes they were able to breed in the still water from the water damage), flooding from upstairs apartments - many of these problems have still not been addressed, even after repeatedly contacting the super and the building management. We have had some success by calling 311 and submitting formal complaints, but it should not take the threat of legal action to get help from your building management. For the amount of problems that occur in this apartment complex, the Coltown management team should be very good at responding to tenant complaints with respect, timeliness, and action. Instead, there is almost always radio silence and the situations are never fully dealt with. I'm tired of our water always being cold. I'm tired of having to email and call 5 times over the course of several days before getting an appropriate response. I do not trust Coltown Properties to oversee an apartment.

1391,BOSTON SYNERGY LLP,CAMBRIDGE,MASSACHUSETTS,02141,US,"NOTE: This is NOT about ""Synergy Boston"", which is an actual company. This is about ""Boston Synergy LLP / LLD"", the name used by Bob Xie for his rental properties. It is not an actual business, and he changes whether it's an LLP or LLD dependind on the day (neither is a real business type). 

Bob/Boston Synergy let us a 2bd apartment in Cambridge MA during the pandemic and waived the security deposit, though he has not done that for tenants going forward. 

During our one-year tenancy with Bob/BS we had several issues regarding the health and safety of the apartment, including rats in the apartment, and methods of egress not being kept clear of snow (with responsibility legally falling on the landlord to handle this). Our landlord handled these issues through blunt emails, pitting tenants against one another, and entering our apartment without permission to install homemade rat traps. He did not respond positively to being informed of his legal requirements as specified by the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code.

Upon lease-renewal season, Bob/BS effectively forced us out by raising rent 30%, and revoking permissions to park on-site and have a pet. 

After moving out, Bob/BS attempted to have us pay for professional cleaning/damages, despite us leaving the apartment broom-clean, professional cleaning not specified in the lease, and us having photographic proof of the damages present at move-in. He became increasingly hostile and threatened legal action (which he did not follow through on).

Nothing ever came of it and we were there for years after. Then when we tried to leave they wanted us to pay for the damages despite us reporting them ages before that. We had pictures and ended up going to court over it but because there was no ""written request"" to have the repairs made they ended up winning. The actual maintenance staff is a different story, they were very kind and helped us out as much as they could without a direct work request from the office. Despite having a fixed lease they upped our rent for no given reason, I wish I had the knowledge I have now so I could have contested that increase. Their reasoning was since they had remodeled most of the apartments that the overall rate goes up, however we were one of the few apartments that never got the remodeling. Everyone had new hardwood floors but us, we were stuck with 15 year old carpet. Plus they removed a lot of the amenities we were 'paying for' in the first place like the jacuzzi and fitness room. The pools were never maintained properly, nor were the fountains. Their solution was to just dump extra chlorine into it without considering what was too much to burn you.  What really sucks is that it wasn't always like this. The previous landlords were actually really understanding and nice. They held little parties on some holidays for any tenants to join. I remember one Thanksgiving they had a bunch of food and music by one of the main pools. We were encouraged to bring something like a potluck but it wasn't required. That was right after hurricane ike I think and it was really nice. It's frustrating to work with the new owners and definitely not worth the price they list for it.",1,1,2,5,5

My biggest complaint is that when the house needs repairs, they contract out to local third parties who have learned they don’t need to do a good job to get paid. There no accountability.

2.) During at least three different emergencies, I should have received a response from the emergency line sooner than a day or two. When a burst water heater they fixed created a flood, I had to call 911 twice instead. They made me pay the full water bill too.
3.) Other maintenance requests were usually ignored. In the event they actually did come, just about below the bare minimum was always done to ""resolve"" the issue.
4.) Upon move in, the condition of the apartment was so filthy that it was a health concern. All tenants were allergic and we were promised a pet-free apartment, but there were years worth of animal fur stuck beneath the heaters. Even after a serious asthma attack from one of the tenants and another tenant's inability to stay in the property, maintenance management took over two and a half weeks to take any action at all and did the bare minimum to clean.
5.) When moving in, there was also heavy grime everywhere, dirty underwear in the heaters, animal feces, a full rotting trash can, a broken chair, etc. After leaving the apartment in a better and much cleaner state than how we received it, we were still charged from our security deposit for minimal wear and tear and stains from previous tenants.

Not to mention the broken loading dock in the back which seems like a liability issue but was a fun place to hang out at.

Overall the place was great but the ghostly and nearly fictive nature of Rhino Realty, and the overhead 12 floors being “worked on” was a lot. You could tell that it was just a place for the owner to store value and for both him and Rhino to collect passive income.

Nothing got repaired. We had a beetle infestation that never got addressed. The sink would leak massively and it took them over four months to fix it. The washer also took months to get fixed. Black mold was growing above the shower, they took months to address this and only painted over it (it started growing beneath the paint because the mold was growing in the dry wall). 

We were threatened with fines for being behind on mowing the lawn, but the lawn mower we were provided with would not work. We were pressured into ending our lease early, with the owner wanting to sell the house. This is understandable, but we were constantly harassed by the company to keep the house pristine for ""showings"" even though our lease had not ended, with people entering the home multiple times a week for said showings.

They'll tell you issues are being taken care of, ghost you, and act like they don't know what you're talking about a month later when you ask why things weren't resolved. 

I also took the only animal in the apartment with me when I moved, and made that clear to the office when I left.

I requested this be addressed for the entirety of the time I lived there- they sent a ""friend"" over who looked at one of the windows, propped the pane back in the frame and called it a day. The answer to this was ""don't open the windows"" in a home with no central air and natural shade available. The apartment was completely filthy when I moved in- there was trash, broken glass, rusty handaxes and knives, and cigarette butts covering the yard which I cleaned up by hand to no thanks. I didn't have a real window in the front door- just cellophane- and all of the smoke/carbon detectors were expired & faulty. Again, all issues that were raised and then no action taken. She raised the rent on us because the ""utilities are expensive"" (she only paid for water and yes, all utilities were rising astronomically across the state- not a reason to punish your working-class tenants). She seems to be a bit fuzzy around the edges, as she almost never knew who myself or housemates were despite multiple meetings. This made communication with her very difficult. Eventually, she swung by our yard unannounced to intimate that she was planning on evicting us by stating we ""should start looking for somewhere else to live"", refusing to answer point blank questions as to if this was what her intent was. This set off a wave of anxiety, panic, and distress as the housing market is extremely limited and competitive here, as everywhere. Owns a massive amount of properties in Easthampton and is apparently happy to keep grinding more and more money out of the people she couldn't care less about making comfortable or having a safe home that didn't fall down around them.

The photo they showed of the apartment looked nothing like the one I got. The image depicted hard wood floors, a tile kitchen with a breakfast bar, all looking nice and finished. My apartment had shag carpet all throughout with a rough laminated kitchen floor. The place was not cleaned and the ac unit was left on.

There was glass impeded into the carpet which I have injured myself on, despite my attempts at vacuuming it up. The shower was full of mold and broken tiles. There was and after two years, still is, regular house paint, painted over the tub surface.

It took over 6 months for a maintenance worker to ever come because they were so understaffed. I put in maintenance requests and called over and over, which were deleted as i requested them. I even got yelled at by my representative on the phone after months of trying to get someone out to assess the roof. By the time someone finally came out he apologized profusely and said they were so insanely understaffed.

1519,INVESTMENT PROPERTY GROUP,CARSON CITY,NEVADA,89706,US,"I lived in an apartment owned by IPG and it was a horror show. 

In 2021, I was a tenant with my elderly mother at Parkway Plaza apartments. IPG had recent bought the project and was proposing a renovation of all units on the property. That meant displacing somewhere between 200-500 people for up to two weeks while they replaced carpeting, fixtures, appliances and painted each and every unit. During a pandemic.

The initial plan was to pay to relocate all tenants to a nearby hotel during the process. There would be meal compensation and everything. But details in the announcement were fuzzy. They said we'd be supplied with special plastic storage containers for things we'd want to keep at the unit, since we could go back to our homes every night after the workers left for the day. Everything else would be packed and moved into temporary storage, off site, by a paid moving company.

As the renovation date neared, details got clearer, and worse: the hotel was only for people with disabilities. Everyone else would have to figure out where to stay on their own terms for however long their unit took to reno. There would be a communal ""hospitality trailer"" erected in an empty lot where people could stay during the day if they had nowhere to go (after which they could return to their apartment at night to shower and sleep). Again, I should remind you: heart of the pandemic. Enclosed space with little ventilation. 

Units would be renovated in waves, 3-5 at a time, with tenants getting 45 days notice to start packing.

From what I observed, it was more like 10-15 units at a time. Since I took care of my mom, and we applied for the hotel option. We were told her doctor's note ""wasn't good enough"" to qualify her for a hotel stay and instead of 45 days notice, a sudden mix-up in scheduling left us with less than 14 days to pack our apartment. There wasn't enough time to get her into her doctor to get a new, more specific note. We just had to pack and get out ASAP. Thankfully, friends and family raised enough money to cover the hotel for us, since the apartment would not.

Packing so much so quickly rates as one of the most stressful things I've done in my entire life. No plastic containers were ever provided and even basic packing materials (cardboard boxes and tape) were denied to us because Parkway Plaza staff didn't want to get more for us. I broke down crying more than once. So did my mother. 

Moving was a disaster. The moving company complained to us they were being overworked by Parkway Plaza staff and did not treat our items with care. Things were broken and boxes were lost because they apparently gave up trying to stay organized. 

We returned to the apartment several times during the course of renovation (for a time, we thought we would have to use the dangerous ""hospitality trailer"", until we were surprised with the hotel funds). Every time we returned to our unit, we were horrified. Keep in mind, for many, they were expected to return to these units every night to shower, sleep, even cook. We were urged to leave our TVs behind, beds, chairs, internet modem, etc. So we did.

The first night we returned, the place was trashed. Things like TV remotes were mixed in with actual garbage, marked to be thrown away. Screws and nails embedded in the carpet. Rather than just stop in to collect a few things we forgot, we spent the entire night sorting through and making sure our stuff was safe. The second night we returned, we found the plumbing had been disconnected and our bathroom was used as storage for tools and garbage. It would have been IMPOSSIBLE to return here and cook, sleep, or shower (like it was suggested).

After the renovation was complete, we were greeted by an apartment with smaller cabinets. Doorknob mechanisms caked with dried paint that wouldn't function properly. Bare wall sockets without protective covers. Rather than disconnect the internet, they chopped the cable off, left it dangling from the wall socket and then just painted over the whole mess (Spectrum technician said he'd never seen anything like it). They removed the shower rod and threw away our shower curtain. They broke my closet doors (wrecked the slider rails). Top to bottom, it was sloppy.

On the plus side, we got a brand new refrigerator. On the downside, they left the old refrigerator sitting in our living room for over a year, with constant broken promises they would ""pick it up soon."" It was still there when I moved out.

They never offered us any compensation for anything they did to us. The whole ordeal was one of the worst experiences of my life.",2,3,1,5,3

Instead of saying ""hey your rent is late by ONE DAY""Junhua emailed me a form telling me to sign it to terminate my lease. After ONE MONTH. I promptly paid and she backed off. 

This happened again a couple months later, where I was on vacation and forgot to pay. The day after it was due, she texted me saying she will be by in the morning to pick up my keys. Insane.

Fast forward to yesterday (May 1st) when she asked if I wanted to renew my lease. This comes with a rent increase and she asked if I could start the new amount on JUNE 1ST. That's illegal. Had I not known my rights this monster would have happily increased my rent illegally.

A recent fire inspection found 4 fire violations, because it's been a few years since they had the equipment & alarm tested. They do not do regular checks on tenant smoke detectors, or hold regular fire drills. 
They have, on a couple occasions, instructed tenants to 'contact them before calling emergency services', which is ironic because the only contact info they ever provided is an office number (no after hours) and an email address which they frequently just ignore. They also try to make whoever called 911 pay the false alarm fees after calling emergency services when the building fire alarm is going off. I guess they just expect the tenants to send them an email and then wait outside all night with the alarm going off. 

Requests for maintenance are ignored. I have asked them numerous times to fix the building's front door, which I frequently find unlatched and open to the street. 

They don't even bother to give me the courtesy of a response when I send an email, and so far the M.O. is to just ignore the issue until the tenant gives up.

1542,AARON DUPUIS,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4J1A2,CA,"The landlord runs a legal rooming house. However, there's many issues with the house that is ongoing. 
For one, repairs are done very cheaply and poorly to the point where it has to get redone after a short period of time or certain projects are solved with a ""band-aid"" solution. When the need arises to actually fix the issue permanently, it does not get repaired. 

Some issues I had where the carpet was dirty when I moved in and it was promised that it would've been clean but the opposite happened instead. The ceiling in my closet had water damage and it was only plastered, it occasionally chips and falls off by itself. My storm door screen is missing the glass and screen, the bedroom itself is an addition to the original home but it lacks proper insulation. 

A MAJOR issue: In the winter, it's extremely cold and very hot in the summer. He doesn't take into account that I would need a space heater which would cost more in the long run to keep the room at a warm temperature in which he then complains the hydro bill is too high when I try to keep my space at a reasonable temperature. The HVAC heating/AC does not efficiently pump the air into my bedroom either. 

Secondly, the property has had a mice problem for quite some time now. When I brought it up with the landlord, he insisted on using traps to catch them but never called pest control or used strategic measures such as not leaving the kitchen in a mess or leaving pet food on the bare floor to end the issue immediately. 

I'm aware that rooming houses are not RTA protected but the landlord insists on raising the rent by 8-12% every year; it's still cheap for Toronto but it's not worth the price where you have to deal with mice, an unclean home and the noise which consists of parties on weekdays by the landlord, renovations and loud music past 10pm.

They would party every single night until 5 a.m., do drugs on the balcony and trash the place. When I finally found a new place and moved, the company had rented 3 of the 8 appartments to the drug addicts and their friends. They were doing parties in multiple appartments on different floors at the same time. So the company clearly only wanted to make as much money as possible and didn’t care about the type of tenants they wanted to have. 
The company also advertise themselves on LinkedIn as “property management company specializing in the rentals of short term furnished accomodations”, which is a code for airbnbs. It is also mentioned that they are growing their appartment offer, so be careful! 

Finally, I had to reach out to the company one time because the only door that had an outside lock in my appartment was broken. The handyman they sent me told me that it was the cheapest landlord he had ever dealt with. The handyman had to fight for me in order to be able not to buy the cheapest door lock (he argued that it was the landlord’s responsibility to provide a minimal secure environment for the tenant and that the cheapest door lock wasn’t guaranteeing that).",1,2,1,3,1

One said, when I called him with water pouring from my ceiling, to ""wait and see if it stops"". Wildly irresponsible. Will try and circumvent the required 25h notice on entry once he knows you're going to move out soon.

The main issue came up on move-out; NY requires that the itemized invoice and deposit refund be sent within 14 days, and they took almost a month. When I contacted them to ask for the balance as per the law, they gave me various excuses why they didn't comply with the law, while sending me small additional amounts. I had to tell them that I wouldn't respond anymore, that they were breaking the law, and that the next thing they'd hear from me would be via a lawyer. They finally refunded the money, but mailed it with a poem about how I had taken advantage of them, and how my ill-gotten gains wouldn't make me happy.

My biggest complaint is that after my first year they sent me an email about renewal that quoted a rent above what they were legally allowed to charge for my rent stabilized unit. They corrected this when I pointed it out but the person emailing back and forth with me was very defensive and snarky when I tried to impress the seriousness of keeping track of which units are rent stabilized. It seems like that would be the bare minimum of record keeping at a property management company but they said they only had some units in my building listed as rent stabilized (which is odd because its usually a whole building).

1567,SANDRO MOSCARELLI / MOSCARELLI REALTY,DUFFERIN COUNTY,ONTARIO,L9W2P5,CA,"Firstly, this landlord forced us into an illegal lease by requesting an ""animal damage deposit"" when he found out we had a dog.

It was an older farm house that we were told would be professionally cleaned and have new appliances when we took possession - was not the case

Roof leaked into the house in several areas, no proper fixes made. 

There was a makeshift sump pit that could not adequately house a float, so, a Christmas light timer was put on it. During rain events, it was the tenants duty to determine how quickly the pit filled and set the on/off timer accordingly. If not, the pump wouldn't turn on and the furnace would be under water. When the sump pump failed, it was our problem to replace it because he was busy, but, we ""better get on it quick because he was not replacing the furnace"". So we did. Took forever to get repaid for the new pump, and, he even went to the local hardware store to see if I had gotten the most expensive one on purpose ($200).

He literally admitted at one point that he chose us as tennants because he recognized I was a handy person and figured I could deal with the issues on my own (which I did). Shorting electrical outlets, failed gas fireplaces (which was the only source of heat for 50% of the house) broken entry steps, collapsed fences.

We took the rental because the rent was somewhat reasonable compared to anything in the area and we knew we could save for a down payment at that price. If the plan is long term rent from this partnership, I would take a good look at the condition of the property because you are on your own, if you bring up issues, he'll threaten to sell.

They will leave you alone for the most part (mostly because if he comes to inspect, he'd have a large repair list) so privacy is good, we were there 3 years and rent was never raised (mostly because of the ongoing issues) so there were some ""positives"".

Landlord checked in a couple of times at the beginning and a couple of times at the end once we had told him when we were planning on leaving -once to give new tenants a tour and once to check on the state of the house and document anything he was going to need to repair or repaint. Always there was a good amount of heads up. There were some small problems that were never really addressed, but they were also not problems we ran into on a day-to-day basis. When we left the landlord was very understanding of standard wear and tear and our deposit was returned to us in a timely fashion.

The kitchen ended up being covered in mouse feces and we had to deal with them in the kitchen for the full 12 months we stayed. Contract was dishonest (claimed rent was split evenly 25% each but all of us paid different amounts). Took weeks to even take our complaints seriously. Air conditioning did not work when we moved in and kept dismissing us for nearly a month before sending someone to fix it. One of the bedrooms did not get heat in the winter. Backyard had been used as an illegal dumping ground when we moved in. Tenants were told it would be cleaned but after a month of no news took it upon ourselves to clean.

1571,THE PARK AT FOREST OAKS,TULSA,OKLAHOMA,74136,US,"Pros: Probably the most reliable Maintenance team I've ever dealt with. Often same or next day repairs and an easy to use online submission form. If they screw up, they will come out to fix it almost immediately if you say something. 

My apartment was not move- in ready when promised (friend had a similar issue) and they waived my down payment and water bill as an apology. Solved everything I reported in the next two days. (If you're polite, they will bend over backwards for you)

Cons: you will not know if your building has roaches until you're moved in. It's Russian roulette.  I lived in a 1 bedroom with no bugs - upgraded to a recently remodeled two bedroom and now I'm stuck with bugs. (It varies by building) 

Pros: you can call the bug guy out to treat the place whenever you want and you don't have to wait for your quarterly bug treatment, and the bug guy is educated and nice, and will tell you all about the ways to combat roaches/ bedbugs/ etc on your own. Bad news is, he's a little vain and pretty much assumes he's solved the problem every time, and is always a bit in disbelief when the roaches come back. 

Last but not least, recent rent hike if I wanna renew my lease is bringing it from 735 to 775 and that's pretty frustrating. Water bill in a two bedroom averages at $50 a month so I'm already paying almost $800 for rent/water every month. Adding to that is not gonna be great. They increase it by $20 every time you renew. They don't want you to stay long-term, but they're one of the cheaper places in Tulsa. :/  (A one bedroom was $535 for example, and the neighborhood isn't terrible)

Gas is paid for, but internet/electric/water is all on you. One of the rare places still on a boiler system, and they have an issue with the hot water every few months. (More so in winter) The longest I've gone without hot water is 4 days, but they're super communicative and you will be kept in the loop for the whole repair process, which is nice.

I had to involve the town bylaw office when I needed a necessary repair to my countertop; and also to ask the Town to get the property managers husband’s business to remove glass pieces from the parking lot after my bicycle tire got a slow leak. 

The property manager has zero knowledge of the Residential Tenancies Act. 3 of many examples: she tried to raise the rent in return for the countertop repair, she  insisted she could come to my door whenever she wished and she charged too much for the key deposit.

 I also had extremely dysfunction neighbours next-door neighbours who clearly wanted the entire top floor to themselves. the property manager ignored my evidence in favour of these neighbours. The husband was permitted to blow smoke onto me when I was outside on his deck, despite a clear anti-smoking regulation in our leases. he was permitted a propane barbecue, but I was not allowed an electric patio heater. this same neighbour also regularly informed the property manager that I was causing disturbances that did not exist. rather than investigating, as is her legal and professional responsibility, she always took his side at face value and kept serving me with unwarranted N5 Notices of Eviction. She even took sides against me when I showed her the efforts I had made to try to get along with my next door neighbours, telling me that I do not belong and should move out.  Eventually, I had no choice but to move when this property manager falsely and without evidence claimed that I was a danger to others. She wanted me out so badly that she was willing to lie to the police. Had she been more professional and dealt with all tenants equally, I would not have been in that position.

Outside of this time, they were respectful of my privacy and quick to make repairs. The only other complaint I have was I kept my apartment in pristine condition but still did not receive any of my security deposit back when I moved away.

Roof was caving in and floor was paper thin, we couldn't even have the tv on from how thin it was and they told us 'tough crap.' The monoxide detector didn't work, the walls developed cracks, they gave us a crappy stand fan to fix a humidity problem. The shower was rotting, the cabinets had holes in them and all for the low price of $1300 a month, which was raised three times without notice. It was a no pets property but three other tenants had pets and the heating vents were connected, had an allergic reaction every day. Sprinklers sprayed the windows and developed mold because of this.

However, the kitchen was incredibly small (I’m talking about 2sqft of counter space and less than half a drawer). And I constantly heard squirrels and other rodents in the walls and management just kept telling me it was because I lived on the ground floor and never did anything to fix the issue. We also once had a mouse get into our apartment (ew) and when we asked the landlord to come and patch up some of the holes in the walls they never showed up and just ignored us. We were also lied to in our lease terms about the process of vacating the property and are currently fighting with management to release us from payments that we should not have to pay as we gave them the required amount of notice for this to not happen. Giving them a 4 on tenant privacy because maintenance doesn’t show up unless it’s a dire emergency and sometimes they can’t even manage that.

At one point they were ticketed by the city for pumping said sewage directly onto the grass outside (this is the time we had no running water for three days).  At every point in dealing with these issues, office and maintenance staff were rude, unhelpful, and acted as though we were being annoying by bringing up, say, the sewage smell, or the roaches, or the visible mildew on the ceiling. My friend who lived upstairs developed a leak in her ceiling, and the maintenance team put a bucket under it and then did nothing else for over a week. When a hailstorm broke one of our windows, it took them six weeks to replace it - in the middle of winter. They also tried to keep our deposit (over 1200 dollars!) because of damage that predated us and had never been fixed (broken drawer and cabinets), the carpet being worn out (after five years Colorado says carpet replacement is normal wear and tear and not the tenant's responsibility), and water damage to the windowsill (because we couldn't keep freezing rain out while the window was broken).

The only thing I can rate so highly is that they give us our privacy... meaning, I've gotten plenty of notice they're coming by only to wait. And wait. And wait. And then there's an email about rescheduling pest control! [ Dear reader, that reschedule never happens either. ] I could ignore the massively slanted walls, I could dismiss the overly eager parking lot cop that has towed me despite having my vehicle registered, and I may even be able to look past the fact that for our entire complex there is only one [1] dumpster for everybody that is usually overflowing within a day or two... if not for the fact that they do everything they can to just not repair a singular thing in this place.

1599,CRA MANAGEMENT,BALTIMORE,MARYLAND,21211,US,"Ms. R Cowley did the following things when I rented with her (via CRA Management) for two years: 
-Microaggressed my Mexican partner by saying he should consider finding a job “mowing lawns or cleaning houses”; also profiled him and asked him if he spoke English as soon as she saw him for the first time. She also misgendered me (and my roommate) more times than I can count.
-Directly told me that the mice and roaches that lived under the porch and in the walls were my fault because I had cardboard recycling in the apartment (that I took out regularly). She then refused to send pest control to help reduce them. I ended up paying for Raid myself and spraying the apartment and the yard in front, with no reimbursement.
-Drove by the apartment weekly to look at it (I was unaware of this until late into the second year), watched me through the front window on more than one occasion, and left notes in the mailbox on a monthly basis.
-Ended my lease with less than 6 weeks’ advance warning, because they wanted to raise rent by over $200/month for no discernible reason, and had already found another tenant to replace me.
-Kept my entire security deposit, citing “general maintenance”. I had not damaged the house beyond normal wear and tear. When I walked by the apartment a month or so after moving out, the entire thing had been repainted and refinished (beyond basic maintenance paint), more than likely using my deposit.
-Told us that we were using too much water and implied that she would like to start charging us for it, which was strictly not the tenant’s responsibility in the terms of the lease. Our water usage was high because she refused to fix our running toilet- when I explained that the high water usage was due to the toilet, she finally sent maintenance to fix it. This was the only thing she ever fixed or maintained for us.",2,1,1,1,1

Sadly these daily calls took over an hour each. Tedious. No rent given back for no hot water or heating. Weeks of just not wanting to fork out for a new boiler.

I was not on a lease when I lived here, despite asking David for one, so I had no recourse for the fact that there were no smoke detectors and the pest problems were out of control.

The house could not reach below 78F degrees in the summertime. He refused to replace the AC and tried very hard to get me to pay for the pest control due to critters easily getting through the drafts.  He was disgustingly flirtatious whenever my boyfriend was not around and he would show up at random times.

Laundry is a fucking joke all the machines run longer than the time it says on the thing and there are no cameras, it’s extremely dirty. Tiny tiny tiny apartments.

Because of the trash problem and the dead and dying rats, it smelled so bad I could barely go outside on hot days. Our washer broke and they wouldn't fix it; after delaying for months, they finally told my partner and I that they weren't going to fix it because they weren't legally obligated to provide washer/dryers, even though they advertised it. Talking to a neighbor, we learned that she and her husband had the same problem, and it was fixed in days with no complaints. We were clearly being treated differently, and our other neighbors in same-sex relationships had similar experiences. My partner is transgender, and had to sit through a lot of aggression and overall extremely rude treatment from Kendra with Affinity. Straight and cis neighbors did not have the same experience.

A former property manager who had worked with the owner before let us know that the whole complex was allotted $600 a month for repairs- less than half of the monthly rent for one unit. A bunch of properties are all owned by the same guy, and they're all like this. So even if the property management changes, this place is always going to be crappy. Affinity just makes it worse. 

When Affinity took over the property, a neighbor told us that she'd done some research and ""they're basically slumlords, but hey, as long as they don't tell me I can't leave my trash bags on the stairs, I don't really care."" I thin that pretty much sums it up.

We have been here for almost 4 years now, and our rent has gone up and up each year for no reason. Our money is wasted on excessive additional facilities that are unkempt and loud, annoying landscaping that at some point every month will wake you up from sleeping. Parking is a fight to get one that isn't far off from where you live. As the other reviewer said, noise complaints mean nothing here, which makes this place suck sometimes. I don't actually have an issue with pot smoking as long as it's done on the balcony and not inside, as you never know who needs cannabis for chemo or chronic pain. They have threatened to kick people out of their homes for any sort of weed possession in a legal rec state, threatened to search our homes while those who violate noise policy and make it so we can't even sleep are not even talked to. This doesn't seem right. I wouldn't have an issue here if it wasn't costing about 1100 a month, but this is a 700 a month place (one bedroom) pretending to be some sort of country club.

Asked him to fix a gap in the porch railing for months, and he didn't have his handyman fix it until we pointed out that someone could fall through the gap and sue him. The outside heating vent would ice over every night it got too cold, and someone would have to go outside and chip it off with a knife, then go down into the unfinished basement to manually reset the heat. Was told that was ""just what happened"" when it got cold. The house was infested with mice. He did get pest control in quickly, but it didn't work.

I originally rented from a private landlord who never raised the rent and was prompt on repairs. He sold the building to LWPM. We've been to court 3 times; a fourth in July.

As my unit is directly affected by the downstairs tenant such as heat, water and power I was never responsible for maintaining them. Why? The building is originally a used car lot. My apartment used to be the office. The fuse box, water line and furnace/hot water tank is all on the main floor, to which I don't have access so legally I am not responsible for paying these. If I were to be responsible, I would have access to the unit without notifying the tenant/landlord, thus these utilities were included in the rent.

When my landlord moved out, it was the responsibility of LWPM to maintain the bills. They didn't. They acquired the property in October 2018. March 2019 they were ordered to restore the power and heat.

2019 my house was home invaded. They refused to repair the door stating they were not responsible for the damage. Again, the court ruled the repair as the assailants were not known to me.

They cut the power again later that year; I was unable to cook or use the AC so I slept outside my front door and cooked off a borrowed camp stove. Again, they were ordered to restore the power and no longer interfere with my enjoyment of the unit.

1644,JEREMY NYE,COLORADO SPRINGS,COLORADO,80904,US,"At the beginning of the lease, everything seemed great. We were the first tenants to rent this particular property from him, and he made it clear that he wanted us to tell him about every little problem so he could know everything about his new property. He was polite and charming and very friendly. Things were okay at first other than some minor things like him not ever installing an interior door or baseboards he promised he would get to.  About half way through the year long lease we started having serious health problems due to mold in the bathroom. He was uninterested in hearing about this, and begrudgingly came to look at the problem. He re did the grout himself (badly) and refused to address the leak in the plumbing (which he had also installed himself) or install a fan. I began having neurological symptoms from a severe sinus infection related to the mold (and likely asbestos) and he became hostile with us. It turns out that he was going through a divorce and it felt like he was taking it out on us. He started gaslighting us and physically intimidated me at the entrance once. He tried to pressure us into breaking the lease early rather than addressing the mold- probably because he didn’t want to have a safety hazard property to deal with in his divorce proceedings. The worst was the way he treated the young female tenant in the little studio carriage house apartment in our backyard. Her entrance was in the alley behind a major street, and he refused to fix her door which would not lock. If you decide to rent from this man, make sure that all the safety needs are already in place before signing anything, and don’t be fooled by his charm!",1,1,2,5,2

She kept the deposit cheque and pretended that one was not required.  She only coughed it up when I showed her lawyer the double payment at the onset of the lease.  She tried numerous times to evict us without cause.  She failed at every attempt to fix things that went wrong with the house.  We had no warm water for months.  She treated us like servants rather than law-abiding tenants.  We loved living in her house and were friends with ALL neighbours, until she successfully made us leave.  We still can't believe that we fell for her bogus story of needing a place to live for herself.  After 10 months she still has not moved in.

Rent has also skyrocketed, going from $1040 in 2016 to almost $1500 for an objectively worse place to live. Exteriors of apartments are ugly, there is a confusing layout and simple things such as porch lights can go days or weeks without being repaired once blown out.

Repairs were usually quick, but this was more a byproduct of it being her house than any genuine concern.

Upon leaving she withheld the deposit for wear and tear. We had lived there 2.5yrs, first inhabitants of the space and the ebony hardwood had some scuff from wear as well as sun damage from the floor to ceiling wall to wall window. Inna did not provide curtains. The walls were painted that builder grade matte thin paint and had a bit of wear since you can't wash them and some small holes from art and 1 shelf. Perfectly normal wear and tear. We were not allowed to paint other than white so opted not to spend our money on a space we knew wasn't our forever. 
We had to deliver the keys to her in Markham instead of her coming to the property (that had security/doormen we could have left it with). 
We did damage a mirrored door on move out and told her to keep the deposit as a result. But she wanted to charge extra for wear and tear. She never did an inspection or entered the property the entire time we lived there. We dealt with the building management for repairs and she never made that more difficult than it needed to be.

1654,MINT PROPERTIES LLC,MINNEAPOLIS,MINNESOTA,55404,US,"Mint Properties was the first rental company I rented from and I have some complex feelings about them. The largest downside is that they generally rent cheaper, older buildings. You can expect things to fall apart around you while you're a tenant, regardless of how careful you are with the unit. Having spent three years in my unit, our stove stopped working, our dishwasher stopped working, our radiator leaked, our upstairs neighbor's radiator leaked down into our unit, and we had a yearly issue with ants in the spring. The heat would sometimes come on late, leaving the house between 40-50 degrees in a Minnesota fall which was miserable. 

However, to their credit when any issue was brought to them directly, Mint did a swift job of taking care of the issue. When our stove broke, they replaced it within a week at no cost. When our neighbor's radiator leaked down into our living room, they arrived within an hour to fix it, and were similarly swift with other maintenance issues. I'm thankful that they were quick to solve problems when pointed out to them, and that they did not blame the tenants for old building issues, however some of these things should've been fixed or upgraded before we moved in. Between frequent maintenance issues and how often ( and short notice ) they wanted to show our apartment when we decided to move out, our privacy often felt limited. They rarely gave the legally expected 24 hour notice before entering our unit. If you seek privacy and functionality, this is not a rental company for you.

However, if you seek a cheap and fairly responsive company Mint will do the job. They kept their pricing pretty affordable during my stay, only ever raising the rent by $75 after three years of occupancy. And while I'm frustrated that issues occurred, they were keen to fix them asap and were overall respectful in all our interactions both with maintenance and management themselves.

It’s very difficult to contact the main office, and there is no 24/7 emergency maintenance as claimed. It takes several days to have things fixed around my apartment, most recently several days to fix my fridge and I had to call more than once about that. The apartment buildings are infested with roaches and black mold, and the grounds outside aren’t kept up with very well either with there being trash around the grassy areas and the parking lot. They’ve raised my rent numerous times as well, with no changes to attitude or care for tenants. Overall please do research before signing a lease, and make sure they let you see the apartment first.

Building was urgently in need of maintenance, mold coming up from basement, holes in walls, rusted-through pipes, nonfunctioning heating, siding and roofing falling off. Of these issues, only the leaky pipes were repaired over the course of three years, and that took two months of repeated phone calls to the polite but ineffective repair crew.

They then got emergency maintenance to temporarily fix the door before not folliwng with them because the charge standard rates, and the landlord got one of his friends who doesn't speak English well to 'fix' our door with a cheap subsititute that constantly gets stuck and is not evenly in the door.

We pointed out that we had paid our rent up to the period of the lease expiration, that we were still living there, and that they had not notified us that they would be intruding into our private living space, which we had FULLY PAID UP, and had just let themselves in.

North Carolina is not a tenant-friendly state but she also goes out of her way to allow tenants to use their space as ""their own"". The only problem with renting from Tina is literally that it's hard to get into one of her units because she doesn't own very many and turnover is so low.

Had to make a complaint to Ville de Gatineau for an inspector to come over and send them a report asking to perform the repairs within 20 days. A year later, still no repairs done and the unit was no longer safe to live in, had to pay about $2500 to get the urgent repairs done, now were going to court. They force tenants to give a deposit for which they won't give any receipt and lie about it when you leave the unit saying you never paid a deposit. They will ask for all of your IDs to photocopy them, which is illegal. They refuse to fill Section G of the lease, which indicates the rent paid by the previous tenant, also illegal. They show up to your unit with no warning and threaten you if you refuse to let them in. (also illegal). One of the owner lives in the building and don't respect the lease, he does everything is his power to stop you from living in a peaceful environment in hope to make you leave so they can rent the unit at higher price.

The stove did not work properly and the company only fixed it after I reached out to the fire department to confirm it was illegal and unsafe that they took any meaningful steps to fix it. The owner of the property who used Heirloom as a management company lived in the building but did not tell us he was the owner. He entered my apartment without permission or prior warning. The maintenance staff tried hard to fix things when they were sent to the building but they were severely understaffed.  When I moved out they charged me two months rent for breaking my lease early and I also had to continue to pay rent until they found another tenant. I also had to fight to get my security deposit back because they claimed the apartment was dirty when I left it in better condition then when I moved in. The building was still not up to code when I left.

I will say they did provide mousetraps when I requested them and no one was ever rude to me over the phone, email, or in person when I lodged complaints. The owner of the building had started to make some aesthetic improvements to the building before he moved out. They did refund me part of my deposit after reviewing the initial photos and issues I logged with them upon moving in. And again the maintenance staff were very friendly and tried very hard. Most of the holes were fixed after back and forth with the company but some issues were never fixed or only partially addressed.

always arguing  when not with the tenants, with other people helping him to maintain  his building
there is a yard and you're supposed to be allowed to use it (was mention in the contract). But in reality if there is someone with you or if you want to do a little social gathering even not noisy or anything, he will come and have an argument with you, you're supposed to reach him at least one week before using the yard but not responding to phone calls, having difficulties using tech like an email box. Result : nobody was using the yard except him and the building manager ( who's really nice ).
Everything is a conflict with him, not helpful at all. spend most of his time screaming to someone and when tired calling the cops.
In Montreal, it's kind of hard to find a worker or an electrician to do small repairs. One time I saw one working in the yard doing a little bit of cement for him between two works.

1733,REEDER ASSET MANAGEMENT,OGDEN,UTAH,84401,US,"Reeder Asset Management operates all over the state of Utah. I spent 7 months in an very old house that was managed by them. The monthly rent was around $900, but the deposit was $1300. I didn’t know this at the time, but landlords who charge that high of a deposit are usually not planning on giving it back to you. Spoiler alert :). Upon move in, I took pictures of the entire house, the carpets were stained, paint damage was everywhere you looked, and the bathroom was in need of some serious cleaning. I cleaned it myself, but made sure to note the condition of everything in photographs and on the move in form supplied to me. Repairs took weeks to go through, exposed wiring and other fire risks went ignored. Reeder’s lack of action around installing locks in common areas culminated in squatters living in the basement below us, and a confrontation between them and my boyfriend. Of course, upon move out, they took my entire $1300 deposit and demanded and extra $300. I showed them photographs and the move in form, endured 6+ months of silence on their part, I even got a family friend lawyer involved. All that amounted to them conceding $172.

But one the pandemic hit everything fell apart. As soon as it got warmer out the roaches came out, and when I reported it to management they basically told me ""tough luck"" and wouldn't budge on the issue. The whole place was full of mold and was barely up to code. My roommate and I were also the LAST remaining tenants in the building by the end of our lease because management was tearing out the whole place for updates. Which they never mentioned to us until a contractor LITERALLY BROKE DOWN MY DOOR to access my apartment. When I reported it to the person in charge they told me no one had broken in despite me being in the house when it happened and holding the broken lock in my hands.

They raised our rent 15% this year without improving anything about the property or our experience. I don't know what it's like to work for them, but I do know they can't keep a property manager--we've lived here a year and a half and have had 3 property managers, none of whom stayed for more than a month, which means that for the majority of our time here, there's been no one on-site to handle concerns like the ceiling panels that repeatedly fall down in the hallways, the broken lightbulbs and missing ceiling panel in the elevator, or the broken treadmill in the gym. Repairs inside the apartment eventually do get taken care of, but that's only because the maintenance man is really hardworking, despite the fact that the landlords task him with duties outside his job description, such as showings (since there's never an actual property manager). These landlords also own the commercial building next door and seem to handle it even more poorly; one by one, all the businesses there have left, leaving the blight of four empty storefronts on the face of the town. This is so sad, because there used to be a comic-and-game shop, a pastry shop, a driving school and a nail salon next door--all useful, interesting businesses. But the crazily high rents of Oak Tree Capital damaged our town by driving them away.
The Warehouse has a clean, luxurious feel, but it's all surface-level. Once you settle in, it all starts to feel fake and cheap. That would be fine, but the way they raised our rent just lit a fire under us to make these guys our last landlords ever.",2,4,1,5,4

Consequently elevator is down for months at a time because parts to repair are obsolete. Disabled and elderly residents become trapped in their homes or unable to return to their homes. Property does not care. Property allowed gates to stay broken for months, allowing anyone access to property. My neighbors were stalked by a homeless man who slept outside their door, and were given a notice of non-renewal because they complained. I myself have had traumatic experiences as a result of the lack of safety and was told the building would have no response. Apartments will be left with significant damage such as holes in exterior walls, large leaks, and other critical issues for months because the company either can not or will not find repairmen who can make the repairs in a timely manner. Instead of spending money on these safety issues they installed wifi routers in every unit so they could have their own wifi network and charge residents. We did not have a choice in accepting the installation and routers use the electricity we source and pay for ourselves, which has driven all of our bills up. There is no discount or consideration for this despite residents coming together and demanding a response. All complaints and requests for resolution are “passed up to leadership” and then ignored. It is transparent that they have no interest in retaining residents and would rather everyone leave at the end of their lease so they can raise rents far beyond reason, and new tenants who are unaware of how dangerous this community is will pay because it appears to be nice at first glance.

Bed bug and ant problems have been out of control for years because its always a quick fix. Several tenants have been without basic needs for several years because the necessary repairs have not been done. There is never room in the dumpsters for garbage because people come off the street to dump their garbage for free and nothing is ever done about it. Elevators are constantly broken and out of service weekly. Elevators always have dog urine in them and is never cleaned.

Overall the health and safety standards of this building are absolutely subpar. If the health unit ever came into this building and did a full inspection I have no doubt this building would be condemned because the management and the landlord refuse to properly take care of the building or do necessary repairs. They just want to make money and put as little into the building as possible. Renting from this building means a run down overpriced apartment with kitchen counters that are painted over, appliances from the 1980's/90's that constantly break, have neighbors who are convicted felons and constantly steal from everyone in the building regardless of the security cameras because nothing is ever done, and having to pay for all your repairs and renovations out of pocket because the landlord will never come do them.

They respond to repair requests relatively quickly, and respect rules regarding notice to enter units. However, the actual owner is cheap and will never do anything beyond the bare minimum in terms of upkeep. Appliances are cheap and replaced with cheaper versions when they break. Flooring is in poor shape and won’t be replaced during rental period. Exterior repairs like missing shingles and siding damaged in storms is almost never done. 

Recently, Nathan himself stopped by under the pretence of a smoke detector inspection. He used the visit to threaten selling the property… unless of course we could agree to raise the rent by several hundred a month. Hard to imagine a holding company with hundreds of units is so hard for cash that they’d need to sell one particular unit unless they could get a few hundred more in rent. Felt more like a phishing expedition with no paper trail. We’ll let the LTB decide.

1769,VINEYARDS MANAGEMENT GROUP,MEBANE,NORTH CAROLINA,27302,US,"The trend of out-of-state property management companies buying mobile home parks in order to raise rent prices holds true with this company. When I first acquired my home, the original owner of the property only charged tenants $200/mo. Now, almost a decade later after changing ownership a couple times, rent is now being raised to $380/mo. It is understandable that from the outside looking in, this seems like a small amount compared to other rent prices. However, mobile home parks are often inhabited by poorer residents who can not otherwise afford to consider apartments, rental houses, or even purchasing their own property. In fact, several residents of this park own their own mobile homes and all utilities are paid separately. Property management is dishonest, and will often attempt to threaten eviction without a 10-day Notice to Pay Or Quit as required by state law. They also instituted a payment portal website residents are required to use, that does not allow partial payments—residents who get paid weekly or rely off of single-person or are otherwise low income are often unable to make an entire month’s rent payment in one payment, and there is a service fee to use the site. The management company has also attempted to force residents to pay for work they did not consent to, nor was it a part of the original contracts signed by the tenants (management did not introduce new contracts, ever).

Also, speed bumps—these can be a useful tool to keep neighborhoods safe when installed correctly. This company recently paved the main driveways of the mobile home park I reside in, and the parking pads at the end of the driveways. It looks tacky, patchy, and they surely can’t think that this increases the value of the property, but they do. The speed bumps are too close together and make coming or going from the park unpleasant, especially with chronic back pain. Speed bumps also slow response times for emergency services by adding vital minutes to said response times.",2,3,2,4,3

When I first moved into this building, it was owned by a sweet elderly couple. They were kind and understanding of how lifes ups and downs needed understanding. They were always quick to send a maintenance man for repairs and we're so respectful and easy to respect. Then, National Management LLC bought out the property. Almost instantly the building started to need repairs. During the transition of the sale, the boiler which is one boiler shared by 4 units, started to malfunction and we were left with no hot water and heaters that were blowing out 90° heat during the summer. When we tried to contact someone to repair it, National Management LLC claimed they could not because of paperwork, meanwhile the sweet couple from before also claimed they were no longer able to touch the building as the paperwork had already been signed. This is just the first of many MANY ridiculous things myself and other tenants have had to deal with over the course of National Management's tyranny here. The 2nd most recent is that I had to wait 6 months for them to replace my refrigerator after the original one crapped out. They gave me another one right away but that one crapped out as well, like two days later, and after that, it took 6 months to get me a new one and THAT ONE CRAPPED OUT TOO. I now have a working fridge, but I have yet to see any reimbursement for all the groceries I lost and had to waste over that time. 
The most recent thing, is that my drain below my sink is clogged, and clogs easily because of a 90° angle in the pipes, I am trying to seek maintenance for it before my rent goes up in June, but the maintenance request has been ignored so far. We've also been threatened not to call emergency maintenance with non emergency issues and I'm not sure if this is qualifies emergency or not, so I've been waiting. Hands down worst landlords ever.

Whenever we asked them to make repairs, they were rude, disrespectful of our work schedules as far as access to the building goes (I had a maintenence worker walk in on me naked, because they did not give more than 20 minutes notice while I was asleep), and there was always a mess of drywall dust for me to clean up after, or my things would have plaster all over them (plus the place would reek of cigarettes). Each time they would say the issue was fixed for good, and yet it would happen again a few months later. Aside from knocking off a part of the rent on 1 occasion where the room was uninhabitable for several days, they never offered any other compensation. The last time it happened,  when I expressed outrage that they kept saying it was fixed for good, they said ""pipes leak, what do you expect us to do about it"", as if they did not knowingly rent a space below pipes. When we decided to move out, they would not work with us on when they wanted to show the apartment  (I worked nights, so I asked they just not show the place during the hour I was getting ready for work and would be showering).

The company usually changes their name every few years to dodge negative reviews. But I'll tell you my tale anyway... I moved in to one of their rentals in 2020. It was covid times, so I moved sight unseen. I was told it was a one-bedroom; it was not, it was a studio apartment. It got worse from there. I called maintenance once when it was raining hard because rain was coming into my apartment through the ceiling. Their response was ""what do you want us to do about it?"" I had an attempted break-in, while I was home, within two weeks of moving in. When I finally got ahold of someone after multiple calls and voicemails, they victim-blamed (""well do you know who it was?"" which I did not, because I didn't know anyone in town at that point), and were very resistant to making any improvements to security at my apartment. Oh, and I mentioned this was during 2020 -- they were regularly showing the apartment within a month of my move-in date because I hadn't yet signed for the following year. They would tell me beforehand, but they were not considerate of my schedule, my dog, or my health when they were doing showings (I was quarantined more than once when they insisted on showing the place). The final straw was when I discovered an 18-inch hole in the foundation, through which a cat had crawled in and gotten trapped in the unfinished basement. At that point I realized they were never going to fix anything, and if a raccoon or something had gotten in down there, it would have been my problem to fix.

As is true most of the time these landlords do not care about your rights and just want money. They are starting to charge $100/mo for parking and circumvented the Ann Arbor city ordinance that was supposed to prevent residents from having to find housing a year in advance. Specifically they had people sign up on a “reservation” list around a year in advance and then provided the lease when it was 90 days within the end of the current lease. Effectively this is less secure for prospective tenants. The rent increase per year is high as well.",5,5,3,5,2

Knows about multiple safety issues (some life-threatening) and refuses to fix it w/claims of cost despite how much rent he charges. A misogynist. Forces tenants to clean building by writing it into their lease w/no compensation. Forces tenants to pay for the majority any repairs/upgrades. No reliable hot water or pressure. Electricity in dangerous shape. Does work himself and doesn’t know what he’s doing. When he does hire workers they also don’t know what they’re doing. Owns multiple buildings in the area, I don’t know what shape they’re in but I imagine similar. Loves to pass blame and manipulate. If you rent from him know you’re rights up and down because he’ll walk all over you and take so much money from you and do zero maintenance of the building - even simple stuff like clearing snow.

My children lived breathing in black mold for months because of a huge leak that was happening from my bathroom ceiling that he did nothing for other than just trying to tape over the active leak. He didnt change any of the ceiling or walls that were now soaked in dirty water and breeding mold. Theres a huge rat problem and his fix was to feed them rat poison so they would die in the walls and the stench of death was overpowering. The heat switch to my apartment was also broken all winter so my heaters in every room were blasting 30•C+ , so we would all be sweating and miserable so i would open our windows to try and cool down and he would come take pictures of my open windows and tell me to close them because IM making him lose money. I told him my heat is on 0 in every room and this is something he needs to fix but he let it go on for months during the winter months (with him always telling me to keep my windows closed) until he finally got some random to come take a look and obviously it was more than they knew so he had to ACTUALLY hire a company who had the issue fixed within a day.

Since then, they've tried to scramble parking arrangements (not allowed through our leases), entered into units without 24 hours notice, given keys to contract workers to enter units without tenants being there, and prolonged maintenance for months at a time. They constantly talk down to tenants and don't bother to build any sort of good rapport. If you do have a problem, they ask to give your number to the worker so you can schedule everything yourself. They don't manage the property well and expect you to be happy when they do aesthetic fixes rather than deal with the actual problem.

The rooms were dark with sparse outlets for light fixtures. In-wall ac unit leaked and had a draft around the 'sealed' edges in the winter. Property management and front desk staff were openly rude and would treat you with disdain for askin simple questions.

There will be yearly rent hikes of at least $50, no matter the special deal you got with the lease, which may or may not be actually respected. GET IT IN WRITING BEFORE SIGNING THE LEASE, because they will wiggle out of it if possible. Tenant privacy great because the property manager barely ever looks in on the place.

Additionally, refused to return the security deposits after we payed for a professional cleaner to come in and deep clean the property, claiming it was ""absolutely filthy"". It looked like a new build by the time we left. I tried arguing his decision with an album of before and after pictures that I took on move-in day, and after moving out, as people suggest doing.

The landlords and/or repair people were constantly entering our unit to access the boiler without giving us sufficient notice (often there was no notice whatsoever). There were centipedes in the bathroom/kitchen and mice in the walls, and one bedroom shared a wall with a den that raccoons were living in. At one point, they decided to repair the plumbing beneath our bathroom, and we abruptly lost access to our home for an entire week. The landlords were deeply disrespectful to any tenant concerns, constantly assuring us that they ""cared about us"" but retaliating when concerns were raised.",1,1,3,1,1
1869,LUNDSTROM PROPERTIES- DAVID AND DEBBIE LUNDSTROM,MINNEAPOLIS,MINNESOTA,55403,US,"***** has been in the Lundstrom family for quite a while, and the owners have not prioritized upkeep of any kind. Each time it rained, dirty water would pour through the ceilings on every level - several of which collapsed during my time there, and black mold was discovered within. The property manager enlisted the help of unqualified tenants to remove the debris from apartment *****, when the bathroom ceiling fell in. Other unit ceilings had very clearly been repaired with paper and paint over holes. Outlets behind refrigerators were just painted over, so fridge plugs wouldn't come out. Worst of all, several tenants had bad roach problems, and the manager would tell tenants they must've brought them in, and try to charge them for extermination fees, despite old roach egg shells being discovered beneath the cabinets on move-in dates. This was likely due to the inch wide gaps in the patio doors, where they were either improperly installed, or the building had shifted so far that the gap couldn't be corrected. I had to seal it myself, because nothing was ever done about it. That brings me to the rickety railings on the balconies, which made stepping outside feel unsafe.
The laundry rooms and stairwells were also heavily lacking. If the laundry machines weren't always broken, the ventilation in the laundry rooms was clogged or simply non-existant. And, of course, when it rains it pours through the huge rusted out holes in the east stairwell support structures - the steel framework which holds the concrete together. And, the west stairwell platforms shift with each step near the 4th floor.
The garage is entirely coated in what looks to be asbestos insulation, which gets everywhere when you brush past it, while bringing in the groceries. And, there are very few cameras inside the garage. (And less in the rest of the building - none, even) multiple tenants have had repeated car break-ins and no extra security measures had been taken in light of these incidents.",1,1,3,2,2

After about***** I attempted to work out a deal with her to pay her back, but she was not receptive to it despite the fact that she’d get her money back. She told me she wanted me out, which is fair, but she was reluctant to follow standard procedure in that regard. I had to request several times that she serve me an eviction notice, she tried hard to avoid that for some reason unknown to me.

I was going to be homeless (and I currently am.) I moved out as much as I could, most of my life going into the garbage. I left the place as clean as I found it.

She’s under the impression I have some secret money and that harassment is a necessary way to reveal it. It’s all very strange behaviour.

I wouldn’t rent under this woman. Any promises of repairs won’t occur, this place will likely be quickly patched up and thrown onto the market again for a quick buck. Assuming none of the above is the case, expect some irrational behaviour from time to time and some undeserved harassment regardless of what you do.

There is a tendency to assume the worst of other people in their communications with tenants, even when you ask a simple question, and that tendency bleeds into sometimes being unprofessional and condescending.
These behaviors tend to denote a lack of practical decorum in treating people with respect, and the jury is out on whether they will honestly cross that line with me as a tenant.
They clearly place the onus of responsibility around health and objective safety standards back onto the tenant and distance themselves from the costs involved in pest control. This is especially interesting given that their does not seem to be a chain of evidence or burden of proof in the lease agreement. Their lease agreements in general were written by someone without legal experience, probably reviewed by a family lawyer, and then given the greenlight.

So things are great while you're there, but document everything on initial inspection SO MUCH MORE CAREFULLY than you might think you need to.

Also, the landlord and property manager were absolutely carrying out some fraudulent banking measures as a tax dodge. For months we were required to pay rent via wire transfer, which was a prohibitively time-consuming, expensive, giant hassle, which isn't fraud, but as part of the process I was required to sign documents with information, especially about the ownership of the account I was paying, to that I knew were false. This was a few years ago so I don't remember all of the exact details, but basically, the property manager was the sole (afaik) owner and administrator an account that was falsely registered under the landlord's name, ""address,"" and other information. This is presumably because the landlord was in Singapore, although the account documentation and wire transfer forms I had to sign falsely claimed the landlord lived in like the Fremont area. The property manager would then transfer the money from ""the landlord's"" US account to the actual landlord's Singapore account, at which point to my understanding it was no longer clearly/directly classified as rental income, and thus avoided international property ownership taxes, which are of course much higher than domestic taxes.",5,5,4,5,4

The house had a carpenter ant problem. Despite it being prior to move in (with records) because it's a ""pest issue"" it's now a you issue. Even though carpenter ants can destroy a house and make it unsafe to live in. They genuinely don't care about the tenants, the house or the property value because, short of a catastrophic disaster, property values are going up anyways.
Rent increases were horrific. We rented with them out of necessity multiple times (they buy up most properties in a single area) and all times the rent increase took us out of their original ""you must make more than 3x the monthly rent"" requirement. But they don't care once you're IN the home.

Contractors who did come over did not consider tenant's health and safety; they yanked fire alarms / smoke detectors / carbon monoxide alarms out from the ceiling while they were going off instead of trying to find a solution to the problems they caused.

There are animals, insects and rodents living in the walls. Again, nothing has been done to solve these problems. She has claimed to be a social worker who works in housing, which is not true. She has lied to lawyers, police, tenants, family members, neighbours, LTB adjudicators in order to get her way. She has come over to the house without notice, taken her clothes off, screaming that she lives here and yelled at her daughter to call the police stating that the tenants were trespassing and assaulting them. When police showed up, they had to escort them off the property. All of this was captured on video.

My biggest complaint is that they eliminated the on-site manager position a couple of years ago, so now all work requests have to be called in. This is definitely less convenient. Also, their upkeep of shared outdoor spaces in the townhouse complex is a bit lacking - basically, they just mow the lawn and don't bother with anything else as far as planting gardens, reseeding bare spots, etc. But, they don't bother tenants who put in the effort to spruce up their front or back yards, or pester them to remove items from their patios.

We regularly get threatening notices under our door for things that aren't illegal and that we haven't even done; they send these out to the entire building.

2185,OREST DZULYNSKY,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M6P2T3,CA,"Orest was a private landlord and generally an agreeable and likeable person, however the unit was in disrepair and fell well beneath habitable condition standards. It appears to be a case of letting the building rot until he decides to sell to a developer one day. The unit is not properly insulated (freezing in the winter, stifling in the summer). The main windows do not open (one window that opened in the entire unit) so the renter must keep the balcony door open for any airflow.

The only heating/cooling came from a lone wall unit. The unit was not powerful enough to reach the bedroom. The hydro bill was so astronomical living there that running the heater or air conditioning enough to properly cool or heat the apartment would bankrupt a renter (on average $*****/month in the winter, without running it consistently).
 
The apartment had a pest problem which Orest chose to ignore. There were loud sounds of animals in the ceiling (scratching, movement, burrowing). When he was informed of the issue, he said the animals would ""find their way out eventually."" Then there was a mouse problem. Again he refused to send any sort of exterminators and said it was too costly. I ended up taking on the issue myself, sealing up holes in the walls that were the result of shoddy installation (huge holes/gaps behind all appliances—guess where the mice came in from). 

Finally, when leaving the apartment, it was revealed the dryer had been installed incorrectly and was a massive fire hazard. The maintenance person fixed the hazard but it was startling to find out the reason the dryer didn't work very well was also what could have led to a possible fire.

When the leak was discovered by chance, they found out that the gas system had major flaws that could not be fixed quickly. They did not tell me of this, instead shutting off my gas without warning. 

When I called after a day or two, they blamed the issue on the local utility company and told me I had to get them to fix it instead. After about a week of back and forth it was determined that the blame and responsibilities for repair were squarely on Rivertown, they said they would fix it. That was in December, just before a blizzard. I ended up having to stay with a friend, as I had no heating, and the gas would not return up until the day I left. I had no warm water, no oven/stove, and no heating through the entirety of winter, and when they finally asked me to give them a number for a small percentage off of my rent, I asked to end the lease early without any fees. They did so, and I couldn't be happier with the decision.

All said and done the gas was out for nearly six months and counting, and even though there were inspectors and workers at my house constantly, it never got fixed and I never saw so much as a dime off of my rent.

It's stated in the lease that tenants have no ownership of garages and sheds, which is agreeable. But because these units are used for the landlord's personal storage, I found on several occasions, my driveway would be occupied for the purpose of large equipment being loaded.

So I never felt taken advantage of or swindled. He treated it all as if I was a paying customer (since I guess I kinda was?) so I was always treated with respect, and he cared about the quality of the building and the units and ensured that everything was clean and well taken care of when I moved in.

Balcony door was put on so poorly that the morning after our first big snowstorm, we woke up to a nice layer of snow filtering into the kitchen.

All maintenance did was throw a few glue traps into the corners. Eventually they brought someone in to do a treatment spray in the kitchen, which did absolutely nothing as they treated the units at random instead of actually trying to exterminate properly. The bugs would obviously survive by just going to adjacent untreated units and return once the poison was no longer potent. I complained of this all summer and despite the fact that the exterminators themselves said the problem was in the entire building and not just our unit (as we kept our space spotless), management tried to gaslight me into believing my unit was the only one with a problem, that I was over-exaggerating the nature of the infestation, that I had no right to demand more aggressive treatments, and even went on to suggest that I was making it up (as if that would benefit me in any way.)

Bugs were a bit of an issue but were taken care of by the larger townhouse owners, though he was slow to communicate between us and them.

He also removed the ceiling (himself) of the dining area in the last couple weeks I lived there, without any communication. I never found out why.

Property is otherwise poorly maintained, dead grass, bad landscaping. No investment in a sprinkler system so there's a trip hazard of hoses outside. Rodent problems are not viewed as the property manager's issue and are blamed on other tenants without any remediation. Repair work done on the building was interruptive and dirty, workers did not clean up after and left things behind. Building is literally sinking into the ground and falling apart with cracks in the interior and exterior walls. While electrical updates were done, open holes were left in the walls and electrical is still not up to code with many ungrounded outlets. None of the gas stove ranges have hoods or vents above them so cooking is dangerous, specially in the small studio units. Radiators bang all winter long. Rent increased significantly while property and building remained neglected. Bowerman staff are a mix of being rude in writing, while being fake polite (and flirty with younger tenants) in person.

The units themselves are nice, and they do paint them when tenants change and make sure they are clean - no complaints here.  I haven't had any problems with management - they are all very pleasant to deal with and have never been rude or abrupt with me.  My issue is with the general cleanliness of the three buildings - there is no proactive approach.  For example, the garbage chutes are always dirty and it's gross (the exterior door you pull open and the interior flap). Not sure why they can't include wiping them as part of the weekly cycle when they are vacuuming the place.  Also, no one can explain to me why they shut down the recyle/organics after 5pm and on weekends so all garbage goes directly to actual garbage outside of 8-5.  There is ridiculous in this day and age and should not be happening. Dog pee stains on the carpet are never properly cleaned.  When mentioned, they say ""It's been cleaned"" which I know they did, but perhaps use something different that works? It looks revolting walking through the lobby with dog pee stains all over the place.  There isn't a regular **** patrol of their grounds so it's most often disgusting as alot of people don't clean up after their pets and I don't get the sense they think they should do it even though it's their property. Either figure out who is doing that and deal with it, or clean it up regularly.  The rooftop patio is closed again ""until further notice"". This is one of the reasons I moved here and they give no idea when it will be reopened. The gym is way, way too small for the number of tenants they have so it's impossible to use at times.

They attempted to tow my roommates car for expired tags and when we went in with proof of the renewed tags and explained that they were being mailed, the office told us they couldn’t do anything. We called the towing company ourselves and they took it right off the list. For nearly a year they required all rent to be turned in as money orders in person. They don’t release the rent amount until the first (when rent is due) and their office hours are 9-5, so finding time to collect a money order and get it turned in was nearly impossible for any working adult. They also close the office early on random days with no warning. When we tried to turn our rent in last month, they had the office closed two hours early. One of the employees actually came to the door because she heard us talking and she told us that she “didn’t want to be bothered” with people coming to turn in their checks, so she’d locked the office.

Predatory rentals. They find the flimsiest reasons to raise rents, and to apply for AGIs from the ministry. They even tried this at the height of the pandemic, when rents were frozen. This is how much they disrespect people. 
I had an elderly neighbour who asked to switch units because of bright sunlight. They agreed, and though she'd been long term and her utilities were included, they said nothing, and then sent her utilities to private companies. Her first hydro bill was in the hundreds of dollars. I tried to help with that, but during pandemic there was NOBODY in the offices, and services ground to a halt. I am SO glad I got out of there. If you're in one of the LivMore buildings, take note: these are recent builds, and they are not subject to rent control. If you're flush with cash this isn't a problem, but who really wants to pay up to *****$ for an apartment, especially if the service is poor, and if the rent will increase above the provincial average annually??
I've moved, and am so happy I did. But you know what they did? They claimed I owed them money I'd not paid on an (illegal) increase for *****, refused to discuss it despite the fact that increases were legislated during the worst of the pandemic, and when I moved, they sent a collection agency after me, before I had an opportunity to get legal advice. Awful. Awful with glitter on it.. Stay away from these people.  All they want are signed leases, and then you're on your own. Shame is that the buildings were decent before Vertica (ugh) and rebranded Vertica began to manage them.

At one point he tried to slip an extra $10 into the calculation of my neighbour's yearly board increase, under the guise of it being a calculated 2.5%

They were demanding, blaming, dismissive, and disrespectful toward their tenants. One major issue was a leak in the bedroom ceiling, which was neglected by the landlord until the end of my tenancy. When they finally showed up, they covered it with paint to HIDE it. Rent was increased by seven hundred for two years, despite their promises they'd follow rent increase guidelines in Ontario. They blamed me for the unit not being rented out, though they posted a higher price, neglected and ignored to fix the unit. They never returned the key deposit, claiming they need to pay for cleaning and painting.

I left the property fairly clean(even steamed the floor). I just wanted to be respectful until the end of the tenancy. All the ""dirtiness"" they pointed out was some dust in the drawers and fridge and some scratches on the outside of the entry door(which the building management properly inspected that I didn't do any damage when I moved in and out), and stains on the wall caused by sunlight or furniture due to natural use. The building has issues raised by other units, but they blamed me for taking $***** key deposit. They were confrontational and spoke in Korean conveniently when I tried to argue. This was completely unfair and unreasonable, but I didn't want to spend any more minutes with the hopeless people, so I let them keep the deposit.

Overall, I strongly advise against renting from them, but if you unfortunately already moved in, make sure ALL damages on the ceilings (there are so many cracks adjacent to walls and ceilings, but especially the bedroom has a leak at the north side corner window) and water pressure are fixed, the unit is PROFESSIONALLY cleaned and NEWLY painted, as that's what they took my key deposit for, and most importantly, scrutinize the unit before you move in and demand that they PROPERLY FIX any issues you find to avoid them blaming you when you leave.",1,1,1,1,1

I am going on two years of living in one of his many rentals. The units he owns seem to all be in desperate repair. You must know what your rights are and be prepared to fight for them. Every turn he has tried to con us. Here are just some examples:
1) Tried to charge us because we did not shovel the sidewalk snow in front of the house. We had an argument through email, citing many times over per our lease and the landlord and tenant act outside maintenance is the landlord's responsibility. 
2) Every maintenance request we have filed was an ordeal. After almost two years parts of the house still flood and have extreme water damage during rain. We have sent videos and requests for repair and nothing.
3) Like the other response here. We found mold in the bathrooms and he told us to go buy mold cleaner form Home Hardware and do it ourselves.
4) Times when contractors do come to do repairs we are not notified and they often do a horrible job. We complained that*****
5) When we asked him about getting a pet he said no and that he does not allow pets. We again cited how that is not legal in Ontario and he simply replied back with "" you are right""
6) We had bikes in the backyard that was only accessible through a locked gate. One day when the contractors came to fix a pipe in the backyard, again with no notice, two of the bikes went missing by the end of the day. This has not been remedied yet. 

He is incredibly frustrating as he will try to violate so much of the Landlord and Tenant Act but once you quote it and show him you know he bends.

They left drywall all over the floor in the hall,  which we ended up cleaning up after a month because it was covered in mold. It took them three months to patch up the walls. They didn't replace any wet insulation or drywall and told us a mold inspection wasn't necessary. They only did this because they're now renting out upstairs for profit. We expressed concerns about mold within the wall and we were belittled and gaslighted. Amber Lynn is awful. She is unprofessional, dismissive and defensive.

Turns out they converted a single family home without making any of the necessary adjustments. The electrical panel was wired as a single family home, which meant multiple rooms on different floors were on a single circuit. The entire kitchen and half our floor was on the same circuit as downstairs. so the power cut constantly if we used multiple devices at once. We told the landlords and they did nothing. We didn't have access to the breakers, so if the basement tenants were out we were screwed. One weekend it went out and they refused to reset the breaker. They told us to buy an extension cord to power our entire kitchen for the weekend then return it for a refund later.

They blamed us every time something went wrong and any repairs took upwards of weeks, or they didn't happen. The fridge leaked for almost a year before they finally replaced it. The doors were too small for the frame, which meant all of the sound leaked and we had no privacy from the downstairs tenants. We could constantly hear each other. The dryer constantly broke and when they fixed it, they did it with a non-compatible machine and the machines would move when they operated. Our unit would rumble and because the doors were too small the sound drowned out whatever we were doing.

When we decided to move on, they'd either give us an hour's notice that people were coming by to see the unit, or just show up with viewers. We always paid rent on time and told them in advance of any issues. There was a high turnover of renters, and everyone we talked to said it was because of the terrible landlords.

2365,NOVELTY IRONWORKS,DUBUQUE,IOWA,52001,US,"Worst place I have ever lived. It’s an old warehouse converted to apartments. I had nothing but problems with the management team. They lied by omission on the status of the retails spaces and what would be happening there. I ended up living above a wedding venue with music so loud everything in my apartment shook. This new construction inside was done poorly. There was little to no sound proofing. You could hear your neighbors talking even if they were using hushed voices. 
I was eventually  able to move to the 5th floor away from the wedding noise and got to deal with a roof that was never properly repaired. Water leaked in often. I couldn’t use one room because of the mold and water damage. Another tenant had a literal waterfall in her apartment from the water on the roof after some heavy rain. Tenants officially complained to the city about repairs not being done, but nothing changed. After going to the city I was threatened to be kicked out of the building. Management changed several times while I lived there. 
Would not recommend anyone live there!! The only good thing about the building is back pocket brewery is just downstairs.",1,2,1,4,1

He would often not cash our rent checks right away and would sometimes save up the checks and cash multiple checks at once, which caused me financial distress. He also threatened to charge us for an extra month in addition to our security deposit because of basic wear on the apartment, such as the carpeting being old; it was already very old and worn when we moved into the apartment. Toward the end of my stay in there we began receiving mail from the IRS that was addressed to the property owner or occupant that said he owned tens of thousands of dollars in property taxes.",3,2,1,3,3

2370,MELTZER,BERWYN,ILLINOIS,60402,US,"We had a mostly neutral relationship with Meltzer because we got along well with the maintenance crew (who were all great guys) so mostly avoided going through Meltzer when possible. We had some routine issues though and unfulfilled promises. We were told they'd be installing an over-the-stove microwave, never happened. At one point the building started getting roaches so we emailed Meltzer. They said they wouldn't do anything other than the regularly scheduled pest control they had come in every month (which would mean waiting three weeks) but sent us some like DIY essential oil tips to prevent bugs (???) which was one of the worst experiences we had with them. At one point our radiators all started spraying water for an hour and nobody came to help until it was already over which sucked but this was a freak thing that never happened again. Also, the cold and hot water were just random and according to one of the maintenance guys that was because none of the pipework was done to code but I have absolutely no way of verifying that. The issue was that we would only get hot water most of the time which technically doesn't break the law or the lease (they need to offer hot water, cold isn't mentioned) so we just lived with it. I will say overall that whenever we had to go through Meltzer, we had to wait and sometimes they just never followed up with us. However, we mostly avoided them altogether and just texted the maintenance guys we knew. All in all, whenever we needed help from Meltzer, they were inadequate, but whenever we didn't it was fine, which was admittedly most of the time.",3,2,4,5,4

Building has problems with vandalism, theft, and break ins, super refuses to install cameras or do anything to resolve concerns. Super ignores tenants and won't answer if you knock at their door and can hear they are on the other side.

Our 2nd apartment had a faulty water heater which routinely would need to be relit and the gas connection to it was leaky which exposed one of the tenants in the connected room to prolonged low level gas exposure. They refused all responsibility and deny the problem instead of just fixing the heater. They consistently raise rent each year and try to lock you into leases for years at a time under the guise of raising the rent a little bit less. They do rent increases yearly despite investing nothing into the units, making tenants pay for coin laundry and the water/power it takes to run the machines, and charging tenants for nonemergent maintenance requests.

They fully neglect to fix their properties. A lot of tenants had a similar experience of moving into a suite that had the old tenants belongings in it and new tenants have no choice but to deal with it and clean the suite.

I was so disappointed that the staff just kept pointing back to the lease over and over instead of acting in the best interest of the renter or the landlord.

2453,ANDREW CIGNA / NFPA,LONDON,ONTARIO,N5Y 1G8,CA,"Andrew bought our house (6 room rental) during the pandemic so he could flip it. 


He did no repairs or cleaning; there was a room that was disgusting because a previous tenant locked her cat in for weeks. You could smell cat litter through the vents. He promised to the eventual buyer he would clean this room and do some other maitenence - he never did.


There was a bad situation with one of our roommates getting agressive when he drank alchohol. The environment was unsafe, he was often exposed and urinating off the back porch,  he would threaten any male tenants, but nothing could be done because when I told Andrew about it,  as it was a ""he said, she said"" situation.  One night this roommate confronted us and threatened us, we were able to get recordings of this incident to show proof to Andrew how uncomfortable and unsafe this living arrangement was and nothing was done.  When the topic of eviction came up, i was told to consider this tenant's mental health and ultimatly the problem tenant was allowed to continue on with his behaviour.


When our house was finally sold to the next landlord, Andrew fibbed and said the landlord's two sons were moving in (even tho it was the landlord himself and one son). I do not think this was miscommunication between the landlord and Andrew because the landlord was surprised nobody knew he was moving in.


 Andrew said he was meant to ""streamline"" interactions between tenant and landlord, but when i had issues with this landlord, Andrew replied  ""Deal with him."" before sending a (much more nicer) worded email to everyone saying he was no longer involved.


If you are looking to rent,sell or buy i would avoid anything that has Andrew Cigna's name attached to it.

2471,VIC RAJPUT,LONDON,ONTARIO,N5Y 1G8,CA,"Vic bought our house (6 bedroom rental) from a company that breifly held ownership in *****. 

The company told us his two sons were moving in to the units in the basement, but in reality it was Vic himself moving in, and then later his son for the school year. 

While Vic did a lot of  much-needed repair and cleaning in the house, his approaches were invasive and rude. If you worked the day he was going through a  room to clean, he would not give you notification - meaning there was risk to having  your things (shoes, dvds,etc.) Being thrown out.

Vic has little regard for Tenant's boundries and space. He would use the tenants' things even though the agreed rule was we used our own things, and he would argue with you about it.

He would not give you proper***** 

He would impose rules, such as never allowed to do laundry at night, even though it was never a problem for anyone during the years i lived there.

Often Vic would hover or watch his tenants as they made food in the kitchen, making it uncomfortable to cook or clean. 

There is a tenant who may still live at this location; they have plenty of complaints, a drinking problem and as a result they create an unsafe evironment, however Vic has taken no notice or action despite knowing this occurs. 

Vic also has no awareness for those with ""disabilities"", and would berate my other roommate for cleaning despite the fact this roomate had a visual impairment to consider.

Although the location may be better now, i would advise against living there because you may run the risk of dealing with Vic if he still living there or decides to check in on his son.",4,4,1,1,1

2473,QIMING HE,COLUMBIA,MARYLAND,21044,US,"Qiming and his wife, like most landlords, keep their property in a barely-passable state at all times. The roof lacks insulation, as evidenced by a lack of snow on the roof compared to the neighboring units, and a measurable 10+ degree F difference in temperature between floors in both winter and summer. 

While Qiming is extraordinarily responsive to texts and calls, and comes to fix issues promptly, he will most often choose the cheapest possible solution to the problem. For instance, when confronted with extensive black mold spots on the bathroom wall, he elected to paint over the wall with fresh paint instead of addressing the issue. Additionally, when faced with a major issue with water intrusion in the basement, his preferred solution was to coat the interior of the basement wall with waterproof epoxy (a temporary stopgap measure, as even the contractor doing the work stated). He did not follow up on either issue with long term solutions in the entire two years that we stayed on the property.

As an aside, the house is majorly infested with crickets in the walls; they often come through the vents and floorboards, and their sheer numbers have attracted and sustained a population of mice who enter the bottom-most kitchen cabinets through gaps in the drywall.

At the end of the lease, Qiming charged $***** for an “oven cleaning fee” and an additional $***** for a broken floor tile that was broken before we moved in (and that he still has not fixed since we moved out). Additionally, he charged $50 for every visit he made to the house to repair or fix things. While Qiming was nothing but respectful throughout our tenancy, these charge indicate a profound lack of respect.

I do not recommend renting from Qiming He.",3,1,5,5,4

Sometimes he'll leave ""charity food"" downstairs which is essentially the expired items from a dollar tree dumpster. When confronted about the leak in my apartment roof which he ignored for an entire year, Chris walked away from me mid sentence in a face to face conversation about when to expect a repair. After the city code enforcement officials inspected the building (while Chris was present), he was ordered to make repairs and maintain the common areas which were full of construction debris, old furniture, and bags of beer cans. Rodent infestations were common, there was no insulation in the building, all of the windows and doors had leaks, mushrooms grew under various tenants' apt bathrooms. A broken oven was ignored for 3 months. A clogged bathtub ignored for 6+ months...  ignored the grace period, visited a number of times to throw more bricks and garbage, doing absolutely nothing for the building until facing fines.

There were other damages as well such as a giant hole in the bathroom floor which took several months to fix. As you can see most of the damages I have listed were all due to neglect and time, as this house was a very old house with very few repairs.

2663,THE PADDOCK AT EASTPOINT.  OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE CONNOR GROUP.,LOUISVILLE,KENTUCKY,40245,US,"I moved in, had the walkthrough as is typical, the floors appeared clean but were covered with a layer of grime.  I had to mop the floors twice to get them clean.

I was informed that I would be provided with a ********** for the concierge trash pickup service.  I reached out the following day to ask about the ********** and was assured I would receive it.  Trash day comes and goes, still no promised **********; instead, I come home to a management note on my door warning me of a $50.00 fine if I leave my bags out without the provided ********** again.

The trash service: leave up to two bags of trash in the provided bin outside of your door on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  Often, I would have only a single bag, sometimes no trash at all for them to pick up, but the time I leave three bags in the bin they actually only take two and leave the third bag behind plus a note from management to remind me ********** can be left in the bin and no more.

The dumpster was non-operational and overflowing twice a month.  This would result in smelly trash piled up all around the dumpster.  Instead of addressing the problem management installed several security cameras around the dumpster and posted signage warning everyone of a $300.00 fine if trash is left outside of the dumpster.

The pool, clearly listed as an amenity, with posted pool hours of 10a-8p was either closed most days or open from 4p-8p.  A big sign would hang by the pool gate to warn everyone of $100 fine if accessed while closed.  When asked about the inconsistent pool access, I was informed that they can’t find lifeguards to staff the pool, and that it’s not technically an amenity so they are not obligated to maintain the posted hours.

One month I was three days late with my rent payment.  I understand that is my fault entirely, but it happened for no other reason than it had slipped my mind.  I was hit with a $150.00 late fee.  I asked if they could waive the late fee considering that I had always paid early, I was informed that there was nothing they could do.

90 days prior to my lease renewal date I was informed of a $300.00 monthly rent increase if I wish to sign another one-year agreement.  Where do these people think that this extra $300.00 is going to come from?  When I asked why there is such a drastic increase, I was given the same old answer we have been hearing from every large company since the beginning of the **********, inflation.

Apart from the initial walkthrough there were three (3) additional, arbitrary inspections over a ten (10) month period.  Each time claiming some strange reason for said upcoming inspection, and always adding a note that “you do not have to be present during this inspection”, which made it feel even more like an invasion of privacy.  On receipt of the third inspection notice I reached out to them and proclaimed that I would need to be present and that they will need to schedule it with me as I do not feel comfortable with strangers entering my home whilst I am not present.  This was wholeheartedly ignored, no one made any effort to respond to me or schedule anything, I was just lucky to be home at the time.

They will not allow you to be present during the final walkthrough after you vacate the property.  I was hit with a $150.00 cleaning fee; prior to leaving I thoroughly clean the apartment in an effort to avoid any such cleaning fees, so this was very frustrating because I am certain that I left it cleaner than it was when I took ownership.

My overall experience with this place was frustration.  The office staff seems to have no sense of ownership or community, hiding behind “corporate” as if that is an entity outside of their control rather than what it actually is, a collection of people making decision based on a single mission, increase revenue and decrease costs.  **********, squeeze them for everything we can get.",1,3,1,1,1

- they were caught Purposely lying to potential tenants- had a friend call and ask if I had pets because he has severe asthma and dander would be extremely detrimental to his health and she said NO. Asked why I was moving out and she said “my job fell through” 

- Putting up an ad saying the apartment was available now, when it had not even been treated yet, and my belongings were still in there. This is when she tried to harjass me to get my belongings out before treatment was finished. 

- Charged me an extra 45$ for a parking spot that turned out to maybe not exist and told me to just park in municipal lot

People have said she seems to have calmed down a little bit in recent years, but she's very strict on smoking, making people walk off the property to smoke cigarettes. She blames people for dog poop, texting them to clean it up. She also harasses people with dogs about piss in the building, claiming it's one specific dog or another. She will not provide proof that it was your dog either. She demands you carry your dog in and out of the building if they have too many accidents in the building and doesn't warn about rent increases if market price is going to go up. She will sit outside the elevator on different floors for some reason, then also send out a notice to EVERYONE about things related to HUD housing, even if you're not with HUD.

There have been no infestation issues, except for when we get Asian beetles coming in during the summer.

2673,DOMUS INC,KITCHENER,ONTARIO,N2H 4H6,CA,"I live in a regular apartment (not student housing) that is run by Domus Inc. It seems that the experiences of people who live in their student housing are very different, so this review should only be considered for their non-student housing.

Repair, Health/Safety, Stability and Tenant Privacy Ratings: I would describe them as a very ""hands off"" style of landlord. They do not interfere with tenants and generally do not seem to care what happens on their property. They are responsive when complaints are made and their response time to building maintenance issues is generally adequate, especially for issues inside of tenants' units. The maintenance staff are also very kind and seem to genuinely care about the wellbeing of tenants. However, their repairs in shared areas (stairwells, laundry) or for more labour intensive issues are often band-aid solutions, and the shared areas are often unsanitary. The also run their laundry on an app based system but they do not provide an internet connection in the laundry area, forcing tenants to use their phone data if you want to use the in-building laundry.

Respect Ratings: While my experience living in a Domus building has been much better than my experiences with other landlords, I give Domus a very low rating for tenant respect because of their ******** and shady leasing practices. When you rent a unit, Domus will not actually show you the specific lease for that unit. Instead they will show you a ""standard lease"" which is a generalized lease that could apply to any of their units. Additionally, they put ******** clauses on their leases such as no pets, limited guests, and that you must pay by post-dated cheque or automatic deposit which is ******** to require of a tenant as per the RTA (aside from the payment options, they don't actually enforce any of these ******** clauses). If you are living with a partner or roommate, they also will not allow you to add the second person's name to your lease (I think this is because they use the standardized lease and are too lazy to change it for each unique tenant situation; your partner/roomie can still live with you, but they may be at a legal disadvantage due to their name not being on the lease). They also ask for an ******** key deposit (it is much higher than the actual cost of replacing their keys).",3,3,4,5,1

2676,BO CONNER,ARLINGTON,VIRGINIA,22205,US,"I rented an apartment from this company (and its owner, Bo Conner) for about two years. I feel it is my duty to share my experience there as a warning to other potential renters, especially considering his properties seem to attract many immigrants and older people who I'm afraid make for easy victims.

During my time at this property, I dealt with the following:

* Bo (the landlord) invading my privacy and entering my home unannounced on at least one occasion, when I was working at home one day and he walked in, in violation of Virginia law that requires that he give notice of entry.
* Terrible windows that didn't stay closed and let in cold air during the winter
* Broken window blinds that constantly fell off
* A moldy air conditioner
* Cardboard and tape covering the gaps around the air conditioner - a grossly inadequate solution that let in cold air
* A ceiling that leaked onto my bed.

To top it all off, I feel he unjustifiably took half of my security deposit even though I left the apartment in at least as good condition as it was when I moved in. After failing to show up for an in-person inspection on my move-out day, he waited over a month before sending me a letter saying he was charging me for, among other things, paint marks on the floor (that HE left when he painted the apartment before I moved in!).

The landlord operated a commercial boxing gym in their garage during a time when COVID-related health measures prevented it. The reverberations could be felt through the walls.

The landlord attempted a 15% increase in rent during the first year, citing, among other things, the upkeep of the courtyard to which the tenant had no access. The tenant's refusal to accept the increase frustrated the landlord, who became hostile in their subsequent exchanges.

The landlord refused to involve the tenant's insurance after water damage, as they also had their own insurance issues. Upon leaving several months after the damage, the landlord tried to obtain a large sum of money for repairs. The tenant refused because the amount was significantly higher than the initial evaluation, and the landlord's inaction should not be the tenant's responsibility.

2720,"SHANNON GRACE, FOUNTAIN GROVE APARTMENTS",SACRAMENTO,CALIFORNIA,95833,US,"I lived in these apartments for approximately 3 months before my wife and I had to move again due to the conditions.  I wasn't allowed to view the apartment before I signed the lease (Unfortunately, due to my circumstances, I had very little choice but to accept the conditions).  The day before we moved in, after multiple requests, I was allowed to enter to measure the living room to ensure our couch would fit.  The following day, we arrived in our U-Haul only to find that the maintenance guys were still painting, hanging doors, etc.  We were able to work around them and pointed out a few different damage areas to them.  As soon as my wife walked in, she could smell something dead.  I would catch a wiff every now and again, but she smelled it constantly.  The AC wouldn't cool below 75 and for the first week or so, we had no heat.  The stove top would randomly turn itself on, even with the knobs off, so we had to keep the circuit breaker off unless we used the stove.  The dishwasher would drain through the air gap and dump dirty water on the counters.  We could hear mice in the walls and vents, and there were COCKROACHES IN THE CARPET, WALLS, VENTS, CABINETS, AND BASEBOARDS.  The kitchen ceiling fan didn't work when we moved in, the bedroom doors were hung incorrectly so they wouldn't latch closed and rested fully open.  The sliding glass door leading to the small outdoor patio could be lifted off of the track when locked, allowing very easy access.  There was a large opening under the front door which enabled a considerable breeze to blow through, including leaves, small sticks, water, and pests.  Once, there was a sewer backup in the main line and our toilet was the closest to it.  Our bathtub, toilet, and bathroom floor were completely covered in raw sewage.  The dumpsters are constantly filled with roach infested furniture, mattresses, clothing, etc.  We brought the issues to the manager, Shannon Grace.  She scheduled different remedies like having the maintenance guys come out to use a shop vac in the first 2 feet of HVAC vent to ""get rid of the smell"".  The smell stayed there the entire time we were there.  One of the maintenance guys told me that they have had issues with smell and pests for YEARS due to multiple tenants in the same building being hoarders.  Eventually, they replaced the stove and ceiling fan.  I got so tired of the doors staying open, I fixed them myself.  After months of trying to get the apartment in a habitable state, we left.  I filed a habitability suit in small claims court.  I lost, because ""the management made efforts to remedy the various issues"".  Apparently, it didn't matter that any of the health related issues were never fixed.

The article explores how the real estate software company RealPage, which owns YieldStar, a system used by apartment managers to set rents [including Equity Residential], has been accused of providing false data to justify rent increases, resulting in tenants paying more than they should. The article provides examples of how YieldStar's algorithm produced higher rents by generating inflated comparisons with similar apartments, even those that were not similar at all. The article also describes how RealPage's dominant position in the market has limited competition and made it difficult for tenants to challenge rent increases. The article raises concerns about the fairness and transparency of the rental market and calls for more regulation and oversight of the industry.

2747,ZRS MANAGEMENT,ORLANDO,FLORIDA,32701,US,"I've lived in a property managed by ZRS for about 5-6 years now. The property itself is nice, they bought it from a previous management company who I lived under for 2-3 years. They do a decent job of maintaining it but are chronically behind on maintenance repairs due to constant staff turnover. I'm guessing they don't pay their maintenance guys well. They do their best and I have had some major repairs over the years (broken hot water heater, air conditioning unit, dishwasher). Lately they have been less responsive to large issues (a mold one in particular) but did eventually get around to doing it. 

Rent Stability is the biggest complaint from above. They only offer one-year leases, rent goes up every year with the market in Florida. My lease is typically up in August and the state requires a 60 day notice to the landlord if you're going to leave. Every single year, ZRS will send an ""early renewal"" offer in April or May, months before the lease is up. The offer has typically been slightly below market rate, which encourages you to stay. This year it was not. The problem with this is that it traps you into staying because no place has its vacancies available or known more than 60 days in advance. So you can either stay and save ~200/year (not that much) or have the risk of moving and all the costs associated with it. With late summer being the busiest rental time of the year, it just makes me feel trapped living here with the cost increases each year. By the time you move, you aren't saving hardly anything yearly. Early lease termination requires a payment of two months rent ($2300+ at this point), something that just isn't attainable. 

They also tack on a ton of non-negotiable fees (and the state of FL just passed a law allowing companies to do this even more). I have to pay $30/mo for a door-to-door trash pickup service I don't need and additional costs for the ""common"" electricity on the property for lights, etc. Sewage and water are also separate charges whereas with many other local properties they are included already in the price. Everything adds up to ~$80-90 extra per month over their advertised rent price.

- never came to snoop or bother us in person

Negative
- quickly switched to passive aggressive and unresponsive shortly after we became tenants
- disorganized, forgot things we had put in writing, communicated poorly to the owner and then scapegoated or gaslit us 
- snappy and rude when we did not respond to messages in a time that suited her (10 minutes being one i remember vividly!)
- tried to unfairly keep as much of the damage deposit as possible with trumped up repair charges. I had to threaten legal action in order to have this addressed
- withdrew an extra month of rent after we had signed the papers to transfer the lease, and she had guaranteed that this would not happen. did not handle the situation until i threatened to bring her up to the board
- sent group emails that gave away personal information for the other landlords and tenants she was working with, violating client confidentiality
- ATTEMPTED TO ILLEGALLY INCREASE RENT. we notified Holli that we needed to transfer the lease because we were leaving the country (within the legally required period).  she kept us responsible for paying the lease if we could not find a suitable replacement, yet was also posting listings for a NEW lease with a $300 monthly increase, acting as if there were not a current lease transfer possibility.  we were already paying robbery prices and the home was unaffordable as it was.  increasing the rent even more and trying to get a new lease (for more profit) while still holding us accountable in case that did not work is unprofessional and grounds for an official complaint.",3,3,2,3,1

Common places within the multi-family building were not maintained, main building entrance had security that never properly functioned, outdoor areas (front yard, driveway, sidewalks, etc.) we're not regularly maintained or cared for in winter months, although he would drop off bags of salt for the tenants to use. Ceilings in bathroom and kitchen leaked, foundation sinking/cracking. The biggest issue was the back stairwell covered in black mold. As the second exit to the apartment it should be accessible, safe and free of hazards. When first moving in I used the back stairs to bring groceries to the apartment and had a severe asthma attack before reaching my apartment. My family did not use the back stairs the entire 8 years we resided in the apartment. I did inform Scott of my experience with no progress to correct the situation. Being the home care provider and working from home, I mainly had communication with Scott. At first he was professional when we spoke however eventually he became confrontational and aggressive. I continued to be understanding of the demand on his time as he had multiple properties as well as his own company, however the few times I did contact with rental concerns he spoke very disrespectful which led to our conversations esclating and abruptly ending. Since he did not react this way with my husband, and often complied with my husband's requests, I thought it best that my husband continue handling rental business with Scott. The apartment design is unique w/ 3-4 bedrooms. Rent was $1100 monthly w/ oil heat, which was considered a little high for the property but due to the location and school system, well worth the cost. The property itself has unimaginable potential and could be a lovely property for tenants to enjoy and raise their families, set in a beautiful scenic country town.

They jacked my rent, they've changed all the other properties to be pet free (my cat is grandfathered in thankfully), and trying to actually talk to anyone is impossible. They force you to use their stupid app to talk to anyone, and refuse to do phone calls. It's only been 2 months so can't accurately rate maintenance, but every other aspect I would give a zero if I could. Stay well away! I've heard nothing but horrible things from others as well. I cannot overstate how stressful this transition process was, they take 2 weeks just to even acknowledge a request that you've submitted, then every single interaction is another 2 week wait. Their system to pay your rent is frustrating as it takes days to actually pull the money from your bank account and there's absolutely no other way to pay it. Got other bills that will pull in the first week? Better hope you've got enough extra because it will bounce your rent and they'll drown you in late and nsf fees. And heaven forbid you need anything from them. Needed a letter of approval to foster for Bandaged Paws and it took them a month and a half to even acknowledge my request, despite nagging them, calling and messaging multiple times.

2789,KENRON ESTATES,TRENTON,ONTARIO,K8V5P8,CA,"Landlord is named Mike, he's an older gentleman and he's pretty awesome. I'm against the concept of landlords at all, but since I need a place to live I can't believe I lucked out into one like this. While he's not perfect, he's definitely the best landlord I've ever had. He's a little slow on repairs, but not on the stuff that really matters. Like for example we had a busted sink and he was over same day fixing it. Whereas we have a busted bathroom fan and it's been that way for over a year. Health and Safety takes a hit because the slow repairs have resulted in some problems. Like for instance, there's mold in the bathroom that I deal with because the moisture from the shower accumulates due to the lack of ventilation. I clean it with a sponge mop, but I shouldn't have to deal with this at all in my opinion. Fixing the fan would fix this problem completely. So they get a mediocre rating on repairs and health/safety (it's not dangerous, but it's not hospital clean - that's the scale I'm using.) As for the rest, they have great prices, are more than reasonable with their tenants, and even when serving an eviction notice, discuss it a full year in advance to give you plenty of time to get your stuff sorted out.

2792,BOARDMAN MANOR,YOUNGSTOWN,OHIO,44512,US,"Even though the trailers are rent-to-own, they still fail to provide even the most basic liveable conditions. I lived there for about 18 months. 

1. When notified that a window (that had been ""repaired"" prior to moving in) had literally fallen off my trailer less than 2 months later, the only thing they did was suggest covering the hole with plastic. 

2. When notified of a serious rat infestation, they blamed a nearby grocery store, and did nothing. Placing traps and poison inside my unit did nothing, since the rats were breeding inside nearby empty units. 
  
3. When negative temperatures caused my water pipes to freeze and then burst, there was no main shut off inside OR outside my unit. The meter also froze, meaning it had to be replaced. There was a shut off at the road, but it was buried and completely unmarked. It took them multiple days to find it, dig it up, and replace the meter. I was left completely without running water for a week. 

4. Snow removal is unreliable, and often just doesn't happen. The more snow there is, the more likely it is that it'll be days before you see a plow, making it impossible to get out of the trailer park. The snow is never removed completely, and there is zero attempt to salt, meaning there is frequently a sheet of ice under the snow.

All of that being said, the on site manager and maintenance team are great. They do their best to help with just about anything, but there's only 3-4 guys to take care of the entire 100+ unit trailer park, and the owners have a lot of control. The owners are based in California, and would rather completely ignore and ghost a tenant than actually do anything to help.

Quickly the owner of the property started showing up and spying on us through the windows. When winter hit we quickly realized that the heaters didn’t work at all. KNL and the landlord were totally useless in solving the problem and denied anything was wrong. We had a people from the health departmeng and a heating specialist come out to the house and they said everything was wired wrong. We started noticing things were being moved around and that our thermastat was set to 85° when we got home from work. We set up a camera and discovered the owner was coming in when we were at work and messing with things. KNL did nothing to stop this. We filed multiple complants with the housing authority, health dept, and police but this man kept harassing us. Once he waited for me to leave for work and then entered the apartment 2 mins later and screamed at my roommates. One of their boyfriends was there and had to physically remove him from the building. We eventually went to small claims court and were paid back for the heating bills in mediation.

Unfortunately, my experience with this landlord regarding rental stability was less than satisfactory. There were multiple instances of unjustified rent increases without prior notice, which put financial strain on my household. Additionally, there were instances where the landlord threatened eviction without valid reasons. This behavior created a sense of insecurity and instability during my tenancy, which is why I have given them a one-star rating in this category.

In terms of tenant privacy, the landlord's behavior was also quite disappointing. There were several occasions when the landlord entered the property without prior notice or consent, which made me feel uncomfortable and violated my privacy rights as a tenant. Furthermore, the landlord would often ask personal questions that were not relevant to the rental agreement, which was intrusive and unnecessary. Due to these reasons, I am rating the landlord one star for tenant privacy.

Lastly, I would like to address the landlord's level of respect towards their tenants. Unfortunately, during my tenancy, I experienced multiple instances of disrespectful behavior, including discriminatory comments and actions. This behavior is unacceptable and significantly impacted my experience as a tenant. As such, I am giving the landlord a one-star rating for respect.

In conclusion, based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this landlord to future tenants. It is my hope that by sharing my experiences, prospective tenants will be better informed when making decisions about rental agreements.",5,5,1,1,1

2864,JOANNE HOWELL — MOOREVEST LLC,BROOKLYN,NEW YORK,11233,US,"Unfortunately this is not a review I would’ve liked to make however Joanne Howell is one of the worst landlords I’ve ever had. Since day one she’s caused contention with us in our unit. She painted the apartment mismatch colors and didn’t tell us, so we saw this after we moved in, and then tried to lie and say that we never viewed the apartment when the walls were white. She went on to get extremely hostile when we asked for repairs for the apartment and went on to say in an addendum in the lease that repairs caused by the tenant will be at the tenants expense (was saying that most repairs were our fault and not caused by wear and tear). In between that, she would show up unannounced with feigned innocence of wanting to give us our mail. When told she has to give a notice before coming to our until she became argumentative and defensive. She particularly was aggressive with one roommate who she asked randomly if she was pregnant (went on to say the apartment is not child proof), blamed said roommate for her injury when falling outside when Joanne did not put ice out (asked her if she was running outside + initially refused to put ice because she didn’t want to ruin the paint on the stairs), and tried to have her daughter key-in when they thought we weren’t home only to have said roommate run into the daughter and confront her (the daughter said nothing and quickly left). Joanne also tried to create tensions between other tenants and us, saying that the the unit said that we were loud and ran down the stairs too much. Only for us to go and speak to them and they report that they never said anything of that nature. Joanne also tried to not give us a full year lease renewal and attempted to give us a 10-month lease extension, the document she gave did not follow the format or regulations of a lease extension. We had to get on a call with her and essentially negotiate a for a year lease, her reasoning was “I wanted to give you enough time to find a new place if necessary”. Our more recent situation with her was a result of a leak in the bathroom, because of her attitude and that addendum (as well as flat out refusing to do some repairs), there was a leak that wasn’t reported to her for some time. We weren’t aware that it was a leak and also we felt discouraged by her earlier behavior with repair requests and didn’t report it until some months after. When we did she tried to pin the raising water prices of the unit on us and charge us a $1200 fee that she wanted paid a week before Christmas. We initially said take it out of our security deposit (she said “no” — we realized she probably already spent the deposit) and then went on to get counsel. We spoke to three lawyers all who had the similar sentiment of the illegitimacy of her request and that the water bill is a landlord responsibility. We sent her this and said if she would like she could take us to housing court to recoup the funds as she sees fit, prior to this interaction she demanded again we send the money to her with our rent. She sent a message saying that she more or less will be getting those funds back. We didn’t hear from her for four months (in the meantime we paid a $300 repair bill for the bathroom — something she refused to fix before) and then our neighbor sent me a picture of a non-renewal lease notice that was posted up on the outside of the building. She went on to send the notice 6x over (twice to each of us) and has not spoken to us since. 

I also went out of my way to ask another unit what was their experience. They said similar in the regard that she gets defensive about repairs so they no longer ask her for them. They mentioned lights not working and their fridge being partially functional. Also how Joanne was aware of things she normally wouldn’t approve of us doing but did approve of another tenant engaging in. 

Joanne had asked us before we moved in what we were wanting. We said we wanted a home and somewhere to stay for a long time. She guaranteed she would provide that and become somewhat of a mother figure to us (we never asked for this). In the span of the two years we’ve dealt with several familial deaths, layoffs, and other life destabilizing events. In that time dealing with a landlord who added to our troubles caused us additional stress and headache. We thought a black small owner landlord would be better than these companies only for her to turn out to be egregiously worse. Joanne you should be ashamed of your behavior, of your inability to manage a building and only want to seek profit, as well as causing housing instability of black tenants in this city who only wanted to ensure they were not being taken advantage of and have their rights met as tenants.

Instead of informing us of this we only found out by calling the a few days before picking up the keys. This meant paying 6 months rent in advance as there was no time to resolve the issue.

Whilst in the property we were harassed over parking by the neighbours. It turns out we were on an unadopted road and hadn't been told, there was also a contract with the people living in the area not to park on the road, but we were not informed until a month after we moved in. The agents offered no support, refused to give us the contact details for the company responsible for the unadopted road and treated us as if we were the issue (despite being harassed and them mos selling the property). I honestly felt as if they were working against us. Due to us not being informed there was only one available space to park for two cars, and needing to park on the road, we were immediately evicted at the end of the 6 month contract.
When leaving the property they attempted to charge us for £600 worth of damages. Whilst there had been a couple of issues like carpets, there was little else wrong. Included in the claim was water damage to a sink in the utility room, which we'd only used once, to clean that sink before leaving. After taking them to the TDS they were able to take £300 (we'd agreed to about £250) and said we'd have got more back had we been able to provide more evidence.

AC condenser had to be shook for the air to blow cold, I went with no sleep for weeks so I could give my girlfriend and dogs some cold air to have a comfortable night sleep. Regularly tried to show up and take things they thought were theirs, so I had to change the locks. Threatened with rent increase and evictions since 2020, finally got kicked out January 1st 2023 after never missing rent, no late payments. Live wires sticking out of ceilings and walls, he said ""just don't touch them and you'll be fine."" He originally told me I could repair the place to some small extent but if I did anything big that would change the value of the property, he would raise my rent to reflect the new value or kick me out and find someone to pay more. I spent almost $1000 that first month putting up lights and fans(to make use of all the exposed live wires, plus there were none anywhere in the house. No ceiling fans no light fixtures) and some materials for small repairs in the walls etc, told me not to send any more money on anything.... so I had to continue to try and make it livable out of my own pocket.

One HUGE frog was pretty cool, about the size of a dinner plate but never let me get too close, I miss that big guy but I think it died before I left. Tons if mosquitos also, as a result of the standing water. Landlord used my property as a garden and to keep bees, which attacked my dogs on a few occasions, while the landlord tended to the bees. A hole showed up in the roof, I was told it was likely a stray bullet falling because of the size and shape of the hole... my attic flooded and I had water pouring in to my kitchen, through ballasts and through the inside of my microwave (which I owned and got ruined because of) and they refused to do anything about it. My kitchen roof got covered in mold after that and I just had to live with it, never had any luck finding a new place. I had to finance my unckes fifth wheel for a place to live when he kicked me out for no reason outside of greed. Regularly told me I should be happy for what he provided... it wasn't even the house I signed a lease for and I had to couch surf for about 10 days because he wasn't letting me move into the original house on schedule. I only give privacy a 2 because once they saw their keys didn't work, they stopped trying to help themselves to my home.

Repairs take multiple tickets to fix and will require you to write out exactly what needs to be fixed.

They also made me pay the first month after they took over with a money order, which costed me an additional $12 and a trip to the bank, wasting my time and money because they didn't have their website ready yet.

The ONLY communication I've had with them was a note tapped tommy door telling me they were raising my rent $100 

They are doing the absolute minimum possible and they absolutely do not care, the old property managers used to vacuum the hallways and trim the heges once a month, it's been nearly 6 months with Gilli and I don't think it seen them do either ever. 

The only good thing I'll say is they are least seem to find good tenants, although I feel they are likely engaging in discrimination because ive only seen Asian and white people move in since they took over, in what is a largely black neighbourhood.

We have had boiler issues where we have had no heating in the winter, mould has been found in bedrooms (often hidden away behind furniture, almost deliberately), and broken windows above outside doorways at risk of falling on someone. These often take days, weeks or months to be addressed, because the landlord does not respond to the requests of permission by property managers to have these things fixed. It is common for the problems to be fixed without the permission of the landlord because of the severity of the problems.

There was also in instance where our rent was in teased by approximately 10% to pay for heating during the winter. This was during the ongoing cost of living crisis where tennents are already struggling financially.

2941,ABIMAEL RAMIREZ,MESQUITE,TEXAS,75150,US,"To clarify the rental arrangement for this review, the landlord is the homeowner of the house to which he is renting out rooms from. Due to the nature of the arrangement where the landlord lives at the home, some of the ratings have to be adjusted accordingly in order to accurately represent my review and overall experience.


Tenant Privacy Rating - 4/5

Since the landlord lives at the house which I am renting from, it is reasonable to expect that they have more visibility with the rooms that they are renting out from. The landlord never intrudes in my personal space and is mindful to knock at my door when he needs to ask me something. I do insist on the few times that something needs to be printed that I am more than happy to retrieve the documents, since the printer is in the room I am renting from. As far as I know my room is never intruded in my absence. The score for tenant privacy rating is as high as I can reasonably give due to the nature of the rental agreement and the landlord living at the residence, but tenant privacy as a whole is a non-issue.


Rental Stability Rating - 4/5

The landlord has only raised the rent once during my time, and it was several months in advance coming into the new year. He explained that property taxes were the reason for the slight rent increase, but no further clarification was given. Rental stability is likely a non-issue as the other roommates have had no issues in this factor.


Health and Safety Rating - 4/5

The landlord has been proactive in hiring pest control to deal with cockroaches that come into the household. Major hazards that would impede on the health of the landlord's tenants have never come into play, and I would trust that the landlord is willing to address those concerns should such episodes occur. A point is docked for the lack of repairs that can potentially cause health hazards that would have a negative impact on the tenants well-being, which will be elaborated later.


Respect Rating  - 3/5

The landlord for the most part acknowledges and respects my rights as a tenant renting from his property. An issue that has been brought up before in the recent last months of my tenancy have been the subject of rental payments as outlined in my lease. The landlord has firmly requested, with few exceptions, that payments are to me made in cash only. I had notified him on a few occasions that I would pay him with a cashier's check since it is a guaranteed withdrawal of my money in check form that can be verified, but that was denied.

As outlined in the ""Texas Property Code, Title 8, Chapter 92, Sec. 92.011 - Cash Rental Payments,"" the landlord is responsible for providing a rental receipt and keep a record of said payments. I have not received said receipts for the many months that I have rented from the landlord since the start of my rental agreement. A rental receipt was only provided when I explicitly requested for one once I realized that fact way too late in my rental arrangement. I know for a fact that under the tenant rights I have he should be providing receipts in the first place.

As such my score for the respect rating is accurate given the singular issue I have brought up in my review.


Repair Rating - 1/5

The landlord has a dishwasher on the premises that is not operating and is in disrepair. The dishwasher has been known to leak water onto the kitchen floor and creates a hazard on the tile since someone can easily slip and fall. I have twice documented the dishwasher to the landlord through text and provided pictures. While he had initially told me that he would look into fixing it, the dishwasher remains broken. Furthermore, he had told me that since no one uses the dishwasher he does not plan to fix it.

The water heater did break down at one point during my stay and the issue was resolved in a matter of days as expected. The problem was clearly communicated with the other tenants and addressed appropriately. I would wager that the only reason why this issue was fixed as quickly is the necessity of having hot water in the household.

The air conditioner had stopped working in early September at one point, and the landlord's response to the repairs did not reflect what I would expect a responsible landlord to have handled things. I know for a fact that based on the water heater being broken that it would have been just as prompt. However, the air conditioner was in disrepair until mid-March into the next year. The only relief that was given to the tenants were indoor fans and a $100 reduction for one month, for the entire time that the air conditioner was broken.

Objectively I cannot give a higher score than a 1 based on my experiences with the landlord.



Overall Rating - 2/5

I would be uncomfortable to endorse the landlord as a recommendation for anyone looking to rent. My communication to the landlord on the problems I have had were not addressed in a satisfactory manner in particular with the repairs, and my efforts to communicate to him have only lead to frustration. Since I work remotely I have come to raise my personal standards for what I expect a rental agreement to be made, and the landlord has failed to meet those standards.",1,4,4,4,3
2942,THE MARTINO GROUP,DENTON,TEXAS,76201,US,"The Martino Group does not give notice when maintenance is going to your apartment, has had frequent problems getting pest control to actually show up to my apartment for scheduled sprays (no pests in sight though), and frequently gives outside contractors the keys to your apartment without notice. 

Online floorplan of my unit was not correct: marked the unit as including a balcony and bedroom and bathroom doors. Instead, there is no balcony and the bedroom and bathroom are open to each other, with a door between that space and the living area. 

20 pages of mandatory lease addendums were sent to me 3 months after signing my lease - 3 days before move in. Leasing agent initialed this document on my behalf before sending it. 

Tenants are expected to perform regular apartment maintenance, including supplying and replacing the AC filter. If landlord finds that you do not replace your filter quarterly, they will issue a $45 fine. 

Noise isolation is poor, I can hear neighbors coughing and upstairs neighbors walking around quietly in their unit through the ceiling. 

My building does not have enough parking spaces for the number of units in the building, tenants frequently have to park off site. 

Unit was dirty before move-in, had to clean fan blades and AC vents before finishing move-in because they were messing with my allergies.

Was charged £75 to simply sign a contract. I explained they can charge me £75 and I'll begin looking elsewhere or they can avoid missing out on a months rent by not charging me the fee. They chose to waive the fee.
Gas and electric checks were carried out as per law but general repairs were slow to have carried out.

After ignoring our please for answers they refused to lower the rent or keep us at our same rate even though we have 9 work orders making the house unsafe. They DO NOT CARE. I have been in contact with over 10 employees all of which could care less about our issues. They pretend they will fix the house by sending companies for estimates every month to cover their butts.

Rental stability - The agency only informs me about changes in the house very late, last minute, or only when I called them. E.g. the lock code for the post room.

Hardly anything repaired, even after numerous breaches. Worst one was when the inner ceiling collapsed with a 1mt by 1.5 Mt hole. Head of property management E. Gordon, when advised there was water leaking from ceiling on the ground floor, told me she would need to inspect (in two days) to make sure we weren't whinging. Ceiling collapsed the next day. Over 2 years later the hole was repaired. My whole family exposed to black mould. We asked the LJ Hooker to relocate us as the insurance and bank had deemed the property unliveable, yet they refused. To list the main issues we had, and both owner and LJ Hooker refused to fix; dishwasher on lease broke down, refused to replace. Increased rent. 7 years without the main bathroom due to tiles falling off the wall, water leak under sink (which lead to ceiling collasping). Fixed 3 months out from us moving. Black mould problem. It comes through the inner vents. Molding on the ceiling fell down hitting my son, refused to repair. Water comes into upper level every time it rains due to over filled gutters. Gutter don't get cleaned regularly as per lease states. Water has caused inner ceiling upstairs to begin falling. Mould from water visible and paint peeling. Both garages close to collapsing. One garage and a fence have exposed and damaged asbestos. Back verandah has severe wood rot and shakes everything you walk on it to reach the only usable clothes line. Windows don't seal. A ""bore"" in the backyard turned out to be a well so deep that council warned, when my son almost fell down through the rusted out cover, that we wouldn't be able to retrieve his body. Real Estate did nothing to secure well for a week before a cover was finally placed there. Owner is made aware of all problems and refuses to fix anything. Raised rent illegally. Floor of main bathroom and toilet are warped and at high risk of collapse. Owner and real estate are aware and have refused repair. Newest property manager T. Zielke, recently had main bathroom repaired by a handyman, not qualified trademan. Said handyman tiled over the existing tiles adding significant weight to dangerous conditions. Didn't waterproof bathroom correctly. Installed an illegal bathroom not up to code. Bathroom down stairs requires urgent refit as tiled wall in the shower moves severely when pushed or leaned against. Advised council of condition of property and they have refused to investigate.

Every single time it went off beeping he would text. Somehow though he refused to fix the garage floor that was filling with water in the winter, and instead filled it with his own cement himself, which then just cracked apart into pieces of cement in the water. These are a few examples of the many times he did lazy shoddy work himself to avoid ever hiring professionals, but I don’t have the time to list them all.

2986,JULIE WALGENBACH (WALGENBACH-LAWLOR PROPERTIES,PEORIA,ILLINOIS,61601,US,"I rented a house from Julie Walgenbach (Julie for later uses) from June 2017-June 2018 while a student in college. Julie was a part of Walgenbach-Lawlor Properties and ran the website RentBUProperties.com for college students to rent homes from her.
When starting the lease, it was required that we provide 2 months rent as security deposit, which was uncommon for rent practices and should have been a red flag.
When it came time to move-in in June, I had communicated with her my intent to be there early in the month and had planned to meet her to receive the keys. I confirmed days in advance with her and took time off of work to move my stuff in on a Friday. On that Friday, Julie did not meet with me at the agreed upon time and did not answer my calls or texts for hours. Finally she responded and said she would not be able to meet me that weekend. I was very frustrated with this at the time.
We continued to run into some issues here and there with Julie. Over the winter when my housemates and I planned on returning to visit our families, we were instructed to leave the heat on as well as the tap running to prevent pipes from freezing. We did so, but then got an angry text from Julie during the break, when we were not home. She had made an unannounced visit to the property and discovered that despite our efforts, the pipes froze and needed to be repaired. Julie charged us for the repairs, despite the fact that we did exactly as instructed and couldn't predict the weather having that effect.

During the spring, Julie would schedule tours of the house for other prospective tenants, as my housemates and I had made it clear that we did not intend on renewing. Sometimes she would give us a heads-up about these tours, while others she would text only an hour before or not at all, and would just show up whilst we had company over or someone was in the shower. It was very disrespectful of her.

When it came time for our lease to end, Julie was supposed to return our security deposits to each of us within 30 days of the lease ending. She did not and proceeded to dodge our calls and texts. I sent multiple e-mails and a former demand letter through certified mail, but my letter was denied and sent back. I ended up having to threaten legal action for her not returning the security deposits, at which point she said she did not have the money. Under Illinois renting laws, she should have set the security deposit money aside and it should not have been used for other means. While my housemates gave up, I continued to badger Julie until she finally sent me my security deposit, albeit short the amount owed, as she was not legally allowed to withhold any amount if past the legal time frame. I begrudgingly accepted the money returned. I discovered later that Julie and her rental company, Walgenbach-Lawlor Properties, had a reputation for not returning security deposits, effectively stealing from vulnerable college tenants who have little to no avenue of getting their money back. 

Ultimately, Julie and her rental company were awful. They were difficult to reach for issues and did not follow through on promises/agreements.
They did not take responsibility for repairs like a landlord should have, and unjustly put the blame on tenants for unexpected weather related damages.
They did not respect the privacy of tenants, with unannounced visits and tours.
They unlawfully withheld security deposits and attempted to swindle tenants out of what was theirs.

At this point in time, Walgenbach-Lawlor Properties, AKA RentBUProperties, does not appear to be actively renting any properties in the Peoria area, but I would caution anyone to stay far away from anyone associated with them and their predatory practices.",1,3,3,1,1

2988,FOREST HILL KIPLING,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M9C 1R3,CA,"Incapable people manage the building and neglect any common sense. The fact that repairs are so reactive and changes happening so slowly after several tenants leave the building is talking about capacity and management's goals. 
As soon as this management took over the building, problems started arising. Four overnight alarms and building evacuations within 40 days! Several pipe explosions and always city is to blame. Several days without water with portable toilets because of “city.” Uber delivered twenty dollars worth of drinking water is how management fought the situation. After the weekend without water and the supply was restored, management obtained a batch of water so they could show how efficiently they handled the situation. All reactively purchased water is now stored in the container without climatization for future events.
The place is completely unsecured with constant claims about how they investing in security. Place became very dirty with very questionable health practices.  Constant investments into a reduction of energy consumption while building doors were kept open the whole winter, hallway heaters are on at an outside temperature of 30 degC(86 F).

2989,PAUL BANES,NEW WESTMINSTER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V3L1E6,CA,"As a landlord, Paul does not exactly stand out. In fact, quite often it is easy to forget he exists until the rent receipt is slipped under the door sometime during the first week of the month, as he is almost never on-site otherwise. The facilities in the building are old, multiple facilities such as 50% of the washing and drying machines, do not work and charge an egregious cost per load, and apartments are given a meagre ‘upgrade’ between tenants. If a repair is needed during a tenancy, he will send a repair person who seems ill-prepared for the job, some even breaking things worse in the process, and he will drag the overall repair process out for days or even weeks at a time. Some issues take months or even longer to have fixed, and communication with Paul is difficult, as he does not often respond to messages unless it’s considered urgent to the entire building, (I.E. the front door not locking.)

From an outside perspective, it seems like very little vetting is done on tenants or the size of their families, and noise complaints/police wellness checks are a frequent issue for that reason. Reaching out to Paul about these issues is usually met with radio silence and thus, police have been called to the property numerous times to deal with noise or child safety and mental wellness issues. While he is a pleasant man to interact with face to face, Paul seems very detached from his tenants.

Paul has also made multiple requests for unlawful fees, including but not limited to notices for attempted rent increases during a government mandated rent freeze. He has dropped these requests and neglected to respond when the corresponding bylaw is sent back to him explaining why the request is illegal or exploitative.",1,2,3,5,3

Turns out many of these issues were due to improper seals, which we corrected with no reimbursement. We spend hundreds of dollars on pest control.  Landlord also would have someone stop by to “check in” on things, we always had a heads up but it was an annoyance and unwarranted, especially since we were paying rent in one of the wealthiest cities in the nation.  He also decided that his custom ugly curtains came with the home (to include keeping it clean and well maintained) with children in the home and with the bright red colors clashing with the decor it made more sense to remove the curtains for storage.

2995,STERLING PARK APARTMENTS,PORTLAND,OREGON,97220,US,"We lived here for roughly five years, and it went downhill right from the start. When we moved in, we were warned that they hadn't cleaned the apartment after the last tenant left. All the carpets were full of white dog hair and the fake linoleum in the kitchen had cigarette ash burns all over. Remember this for later in the review. We were also told all of the patios/balconies were going to be replaced due to age/safety issue. Spoiler alert: only two balconies of all 16 on property were replaced, in our last year there, and only because they were literally falling off the building and you could see them from the manager's office.
Speaking of management, the property is owned by some property guy out in Florida, but managed by multiple local companies over the years. We had at least five, including the current management co Wonder Dog. The first group actually answered questions and repairs were done in a timely manner, but were replaced in our second year for a cheaper company. The next three just kept getting worse, including at one point not making sure the garbage co they had switched to were actually doing their job, so trash had piled up for over a week before i threatened management in person to report them for health and safety violations.
The apartments themselves were from the 70s, and we're not well kept up. Each unit had a fire place that was supposed to be cleaned once a year; this happened once. We were never able to use ours anyways, as the roof had a leak because of how poorly the roof and chimney were joined. This leak spread through the ceiling and into the wall over the chimney. It took us almost four years of complaints and eventual threats to finally get them to fix it, and they still did it wrong and had to fix it a second time. Also, the ventilation system was connected to the unit directly under ours, whose inhabitants smoked cigarettes and weed, and also left cigarette butts all over the ground under our balcony and blamed it on us. Neither of us smoked since my wife has extremely bad asthma.
Back to the balconies. As stated above, we were told the balconies would be replaced due to them being old and potentially unsafe. Multiple times we had to have maintenance come and reattach the railing because it was pulling away from the building walls. The wood was rotting, both in the balconies and side of the buildings, because the gutters were only cleared out once a year (maybe), but we're right under multiple trees so we're constantly clogged. Both tenants and maintenance had to explain this multiple times to management, who were always confused on why the gutters needed to be cleaned out multiple times a year.
We kept plants one our balcony, and were sent a notice by management to remove them or we would be fined. This despite multiple other tenants literally filling their balconies with trash which was never removed.
There was multiple shootings at the Powell Court apartments behind us, which was our sister property managed by the same company and had the same owner. We were supposed to have on-site security, who only showed up once a week to do a brief pass in their car before leaving. Police never came when we called, and when we told management of what happened they were always shocked. In the last year we lived at Sterling Park the constant domestic abuse and fights from Powell Court was one of the main reasons we left.
We let management know in person, on the phone, and in writing that we were leaving when our lease ended at the end of December. Despite this, when we went to remind them before our lease was up, they had removed all ways to communicate with them. They had also reduced office hours to 10 am to 2 pm, but were closed most days. They used this as an excuse to charge us another month once we're finally able to get a hold of someone at the office.
When we left, we did a thorough deep scrub of the apartment, replacing anything that needed to be replaced (lightbulbs, range pans, etc), getting into every nook and cranny. My wife's mom cleans professionally and helped us get everything ready for inspection. Management wouldn't tell us when they would do the move-out inspection, and then charged us for all the cleaning we did. They also charged us for issues we had been reporting for the past five years, things that had been noted on our move-in checklist. They stole our security deposit, pet deposit, and then tried to charge us for the entirety of January when we had been moved out before the end of December. they even charged us for carpet replacement when it's industry standard to replace carpets after every move out.

She often drove by the house and followed up by email if there was something she saw that was unsatisfactory. The actual house is livable, but not at all updated or well-kept and for the final walkthrough at the end of the lease she tried to add a lot of issues that were existing at the start of the lease--I'm talking about scratches on the 20-year-old vinyl tiles, dirt on the garage floor, missing keys that she never gave us. etc. It was incredibly stressful to be her tenant.",1,4,3,3,1

3004,LEADERS,DERBY,ENGLAND,DE23 3UQ,GB,"Biggest problem with Leaders was repairs. When I first moved in, about 4 radiators didn’t heat up - called them up and told them, they asked if I had bled the radiators, because that’s the ‘tenant responsibility’. No it isn’t, it’s fixtures and fittings and part of the boiler system. Not for me. Eventually my father in law who is a gas engineer visited and he fixed it, was a problem with the thermostatic valves. Then spent about 6 months without a toilet in the bathroom because it leaked into the ceiling downstairs. The plumber ‘didn’t have the parts’ and covid had kicked off, so he turned it off as I had a toilet downstairs. I spent weeks chasing and it’s only when I threatened to get it fixed by another plumber and bill the landlord for it that anything was done. On speaking to the plumber, he apparently often worked with the landlord and she was cheap which is why it took so long, not sure on that one. When I then raised the big water stain in the ceiling, they offered me £100 to get it professionally painted - not taking that bait and having you charge me for a rubbish paint job on exit. Kitchen blind broke, offered me £50 to buy a new one - current blind was held on with picture hooks and could not find another blind with such an intricate fastening system! There was a window in the conservatory that had blown, the membrane under the stones in the garden was like Swiss cheese so the garden was full of weeds, carpets in the bathroom and toilet, bath tap was broken on move in, it generally just wasn’t looked after. There was at one point where I had so many tickets raised, I’d forgotten what I had and hadn’t reported. Was told they had no knowledge of one repair, until I told them the exact time and date I raised it and attached the backup to the email - then I never heard anything again. Tried to uplift the rent 8% when inflation was tiny from covid - I did dispute it and they did not raise it in the end, which was good. Called to let them know as a courtesy my partner had moved in, which they tried to charge me £50 for - I said I didn’t want to change the tenancy, I’m just FYI’ing you, as per the contract. She kept trying to get me to change the agreement, with reasons such as, ‘if he punched the wall and put a hole in it, we can charge him not you if he’s on the tenancy’. I said well the deposit money is mine and I imagine you’d take it out of that, and he’s not entitled to any of that money when we leave, it’s mine. She spoke to the landlord and they were fine with him not being on the tenancy so Leaders were just trying for more money for no reason. I had about 4 property managers in the first year that I lived there, could never remember who to contact. When I was leaving, I was told they’d be round to take pictures - it actually turned out to be 2 viewings! They stayed behind and I said I wasn’t happy about that, they apologised but they couldn’t do much of course. She then asked if there were any problems with the property, so I listed everything I could think of, she had to use her notepad as the box on the form wasn’t big enough. Drove past it after we moved out and saw the broken blind in the window, so I don’t think they did a single repair - although they did return my full deposit, so at least I didn’t pay for them! They weren’t cowboys by any stretch and we didn’t have any mould problems, just very slow, frustrating and sometimes a bit accusatory/rude, and there was some kind of disconnect between landlord and managers - either communication was poor or landlord wasn’t bothered.",1,5,3,4,3

3054,WILLIAM M WALTON,OVERLAND PARK,KANSAS,66204,US,"My family had the mispleasure of renting from William ""Bill"" Walton and his wife, Prairie Village realtor Susan ""Sue"" Walton for twelve years. At first things seemed great, he lived right up the street so dropping off the rent was a breeze and things worked relatively well the first two or so years. Unfortunately, the longer we stayed in the house, the more apparent it became that they had purchased and rented this house without actually knowing anything about it. For instance, the fundamentalist family who had owned the home before them had ripped out or disabled all but one of the phone lines in the house and the master phone jack outside of the house. There were eight or more phone jacks scattered around. The back half of the house was an illegal addition, which *is* something that the Waltons should have known before purchasing the house due to the fact it doesn't show on the official city plans for it. It was built about as well as that would suggest and the maintenance before we moved in pretty much boiled down to a good deep cleaning of the already ancient carpeting. This addition comprised not only the ""master"" bedroom, a family room, and the basement. Oh the basement!

But first, the master bedroom. The master bedroom, part of the illegal addition, had almost no heat in winter and almost no air conditioning in the summer. Crossing the threshold onto the addition in the summer was like stepping suddenly in Hawaii. The rest of the house did not suffer from this problem. We brought it to Bill's attention the first year and his response was effectively a shrug. He quoted to us how much it would be to fix it and noted he'd have to raise the rent to pay for it and he didn't want to do that to us so couldn't we just live with it? Reader, we did. That would be bad enough, but attached to the ""master"" bedroom was a half bath that backed up to the garage. ""Backed up"" being the key phrase here. If you wanted to do laundry and go to the toilet at the same time, you ran the risk of that toilet (usually) backing up not only onto the linoleum tile, but that same dread carpet. If you took a shower across the house and flushed the toilet within ten minutes, you risked the same. Eventually, every time you flushed ran this risk. Again, this was something we were expected to mitigate so we bought the cheapest possible toilet paper and tried to avoid using the facility unless necessary. Oh, and all the times that the washing machine going through a normal cycle ended up causing a decidedly un-washing machine-like backup onto the carpet, no carpet cleanings were offered and the biohazard was left to be our problem.

The heating and cooling was a frequent bug bear for the house. Unfortunately despite the house having many working outlets and all the machines and appliances you would expect from a modern home, (mostly renter owned, though a refrigerator and microwave were provided), the house was not rated for any amount of power outlet significantly above ""Amish."" Which, in combination with buying the cheapest possible house outfittings lead to many, many summers in which we boiled alive waiting for the handy man to come out, get into the attic, poke around, and have to reset or replace the air conditioning control. Again. Most notably this happened over one summer in which I had a once-in-a-lifetime psoriasis that my doctor instructed me to keep as cool as possible. The temperatures hit over 90 outside every day for the week I was afflicted and the house was easily over 100 on the inside for over a week. There was no sense of urgency in any of the myriad times this happened to make the house actually livable.

One of the first questions we asked on viewing the house was about the basement. The basement in the illegal add-on that should have been city-mandated to be fixed before allowing renters in it. Or at the very least, the ones after us! Driving by it these days, it's clear that the only significant updates that Bill and Sue Walton made to the house was a frankly ugly paint job that should make it exceptionally clear to potential renters that their specialty has turned to Section-8 housing (not a joke.)

I digress. The basement. The one question that had been asked about it was ""Does it flood?"" And the response was ""No, not to our knowledge."" But to reassure us, Bill pointed out the sump pump, cited the fact that he lived up the street (out of the flood plain) and never had any issues with water coming into his home. Inevitably, it flooded. Was it our fault for putting valuables in the basement? Perhaps. But we had been misled into thinking this was a Dry Basement. Each time the sump pump had to be replaced (five? six times?) except for the very last, it was replaced with the exact same model as the original one. One that under normal circumstances was supposed to last for ten years before needing to be replaced. We burned through them in less than three. Once it got to the point of replacement every year or more frequently, Bill chose to replace it with a very good, but very loud model that made it sound like a shotgun was going off every hour under the master bedroom. Our current house, on the other side of town, has a sump pump as well. Even in the rainy season, it only goes off a handful of times per day and is barely audible unless you're specifically listening for it. Even if you're standing relatively near it in the basement. We have always believed that model was chosen out of spite.

And it's hard to talk about this particular house and this particular landlord (Bill Walton and his wife, Prairie Village and Overland Park realtor Sue Walton), without mentioning the tree roots. Oh the tree roots. Now we live in a city that prides itself on its trees. This much is understood. We also live in a city built at a time that clay pipes for water waste were standard. Clay, of course, being a component of dirt. And much like the biblical ashes to ashes, dust to dust, our clay pipes wished the return to the soil they were planted in. We made it maybe.... four years before the toilets started having intermittent issues where you could have a whole day of normal flushing. Weeks and weeks of normal flushing and everything going down smoothly and then all of the sudden, the roots would revolt and cause a backup into the back bathroom (inevitable), the bathtub in the front bathroom (regrettably common), and often times other, traditionally output, drains. We called, they fixed it, whatever. A year or two later, we had the same problem: we called, they fixed it, whatever. The problem became that over twelve years, this became a more and more frequent issue with this house. To the point that the year we finally moved, over that winter, we had people out every week or every two weeks and spent more time ""reading the paper"" at the local gas stations and grocery stores than we did our actual private, privy. To their credit, they normally had someone come out within the day or the next day to flush the pipes and send out their snake. Now, we didn't know this when we started having issues, but if you want to take your pipes out to the sewer to truly clean them of tree roots, you need to have between a 50ft and 200ft snake. The problem with the service were receiving was that the company only had a 50ft snake and we needed at least 100ft more than that to actually clear the clog. We told Bill this. RotorRooter told Bill this. Hell, we even got the actual plumber in our actual house on our cell phone to tell Bill directly as opposed to through a desk jockey middle man that we needed a longer snake and he needed to find a company with suitable footage. Did he? No. Was he willing to pay the extra money to have one of their people with a longer snake come out? Also, apparently, no.

Oh and the second, other question that we had asked before moving into the house was regarding the dishwasher. Our household did not at the time and does not currently use a dishwasher, preferring greatly to do the dishes by hand. We get that this is not actually standard practice, but what having a dishwasher unused does is open a dry pipe to the sewer line. We had asked specifically if this was going to cause any issues. We were assured that completely ignoring the dishwasher would be a perfectly fine course of action. In fact, since we told him we didn't use the dishwasher, he wouldn't bother having the water pipes installed so that their non-usage wouldn't result in the pipes rotting. Very reasonable! But there was still the matter of those open holes that he didn't want to close up in case the next tenant wanted to make use of the dishwasher. So that led to a chronic mouse problem.... Dozens and dozens of the fluffers poured into the house at various times over the years. Often times in the winter or spring, but not exclusively. There was not one room in the house untouched by them. Many, many boxes of possessions ruined due to their excretions. Many of which were, ironically, boxes that we had rescued from the flood-prone basement. No course of action that we took was ever stringent enough to get rid of the mice because the problem was fundamentally the dishwasher. The dishwasher that Bill insisted someone down the line was going to want. The dishwasher that was frequently covered to the point of coated in mouse poop.

Beyond the first five or so years, when it was clear the house was awful, no preventative upkeep was ever offered. No gutter cleanings, no siding repair, no offers to actually update things that weren't complained about and no updates actually made that couldn't be fulfilled out of his warehouse of ""the cheapest [X] I could find."" Again, not an exaggeration, he straight up told us this while replacing either one of the ceiling fans (that we eventually just stopped using cos they broke so often) or the microwave, that again, we stopped using after the fourth replacement and bought our own that sat on the counter diagonal from the broken one we had been given.

Is this all of his failures as a landlord? Gosh no. But this is already more of a novel than a blurb. What I will say is that seven years later, I'm still pretty annoyed that Bill Walton argued to our face that we needed to give a two month notice before leaving, despite our original signing only requiring one month and the rest of the time having been a gentleman's agreement based firmly in the original legal document. He then tried to get sympathy from us, sitting in neutral ground at a McDonald's sort of close to our houses that he was losing just so much money on the Section 8 housing that he had bought into. Couldn't we have compassion for his slumlord ways given all the expense and effort that he willingly had chosen to take on in search of state credits for housing the otherwise unhouseable? He also kept half of our deposit for the ancient carpet not being cleaned to his standards after we moved out. The carpet that literally was turning to dust as we tried to clean it.

TL;DR: the house was not kept up to acceptable living standards for humans for the vast majority of the time there, Bill Walton lied directly to our face about our rental agreement when we finally attempted to leave, and despite our final rent being in the neighbourhood of $1,175 and our rent specifically paying off the entire mortgage for that house, it still somehow was not enough to actually pay for much needed repairs. I would not recommend this man or his wife, luxury real estate agent Sue Walton AKA Susan Walton doing business in the Prairie Village and Overland Park areas of the Kansas City Metro area to my worst enemy.

She also promises many things but never delivers, including repairs needed to the house. The property has a fire damaged garage that is condemned and she just advises all tenants to avoid it.

When i confront her, she says once I pay her, she would call them back and recant. She basically wants me to pay for all the wear and tear and says it cost twice the deposit. I do not owe her money. In fact, she owes me my deposit.

3089,PROSPERO INTERNATIONAL REALTY,VANCOUVER,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V6M 1T5,CA,"The one thing we have on our side is that my building in Arbutus was diligently cared for and maintained by the previous company, before Prospero took over.  So Prospero inherited a gem that didn’t need a lot of work, except for occasional things here and there.  They got lucky.

Prospero has a network of different rental buildings it manages and has different building managers for each property.  Building managers don’t appear to be accountable to anyone and seem to make up the rules as they go along.  

The level of service fluctuates wildly depending on the issue.  Overall, renting with Prospero is below average.  Unfortunately, this is a big, rich company with deep pockets in Metro Van real estate and they can do whatever they want.  

In the 5 years that Prospero has been managing my building, there have been 4 different managers with varying degrees of effectiveness.  Examples:

1. When my toilet broke, a plumber was dispatched immediately.

2. Noise complaints have been dealt with quickly.  However, smoking complaints have rarely been addressed in a timely way. I had constant weed smoke coming into my suite from my neighbour and I had a baby at the time.

3. A CCTV system was installed after back-to-back-to-back break ins.

4. Two years ago, the hot water tank for the building broke down, and no one from the company advised the tenants.  We were without hot water for 3 days.  It was only after I phoned after 8 hours on day one that I was informed.  No further updates were provided.  We just had to suck it up and wait.

5. I had a recurrent clogged pipe in my bathroom sink and a building manager told me it was my responsibility to have it fixed, which was not true. The Residential Tenancy Branch had to be involved to instruct the company on its obligations.

6. Responses to requests for maintenance or assistance often happen at the last minute.  I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve been phoned where the manager has said “The handyman is coming to your place in 15 mins” or “I am stopping by in one hour” and I’ve been at work.  

7. The worst (so far) is having had to wait one month for someone to do something about an electrical issue in my apartment.  I was without a proper functioning outlet in my living room for all that time, so no lights for me!

8. They do the literal bare minimum for snow removal in winter and putting down salt/sand for safety.  It’s shameful.

Prospero increases the rent every year at the max rate of the BC gov’t limit.

The company is, for the most part, cheap and not super responsive.  You will have to often have to chase them for resolutions to issues.

(Prospero happens to own the building where I work too and it’s exactly the same experience, except they nickel and dime us 10x more for everything)

They do not allow you to contact building managers on weekends, except for “emergencies”.  Managers do not live on-site.

Certainly not the worst company I’ve ever rented from, but nowhere near the best either.",3,4,3,5,3
3090,TOOP AND TOOP,ADELAIDE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,5067,AU,"Toop appears to try very hard to manage maintenance. Their repairs portal is a good effort and recently their inspections now return a 'report card' - this gives a well structured outline of the property's health and any actionable items. That said, it seems there are communication issues within because what has been reported or communicated to repair contractors is often lost or misinterpreted. More than once contractors were sent to inspect the same gutter issue and reported to us the same solutions. However, the action taken by the agent/landlord was entirely different. We've had a revolving door of contractors over 6 months, often saying their notes ""make no sense at all"". The problem remains.

We've struggled a bit with pests and Toop have responded very well with efforts to help bait and remove them. However, the property is prone to nests (both cockroaches and rats) because of disrepair, something that we've apparently struggled to communicate properly. When reporting salt-damp on the house facade, this was assessed and resolved very promptly. Salt-damp inside the house is unresolved after 12 months. Mould issues also remain. Complaints are often countered with ""try bleach"" or ""we'll resolve the roof leaking first - we think this is the actual cause"". It genuinely feels like gaslighting.

Our rate seem appropriate given our location and the property's standing. The recent rate hikes were non-negotiable, which felt unfair considering pending repair work.

The shed is half-filled with the landlords old furniture. This is highly inappropriate - being a space that we pay for. When we've reported this, Toop suggests we can dump it at our own cost.

Overall we like Toop the most of all our agents and would recommend them to others.",4,3,5,5,4

Our rent was always paid weeks or days in advance, and I even bought my own materials to repair things that had broken

Eventually when we found a new place to move, I called the property management to ask how to properly give 2 months notice (it was my first time renting) she told me that I had to give it in writing, so right away I went and wrote out a notice for her and called to ask where to bring it/mail it bit never got an answer, called back many times and left voicemail after voicemail and eventually decided to leave a Facebook message and text message with my notice thinking it would be fine, months later she calls me out of the blue asking how I expect to pay her the ""months of rent I owe' I asked her what she meant and she told her I never gave her notice that I was moving, so I reminded her of out call and all of the other calls I sent with no answers, sbe didnt like that answer and I ended up having to block her

Someone I know actually was meant to go for a viewing there not long after I moved out, I'm not sure if it was the same unit so I could very much be wrong, but I feel like they failed at renting it out in the first few months after I moved and wanted to still make money for those months as they know I'm a very honest and anxious new renter and they might have assumed I'd let them take advantage of me

- A leak from the unit above me went through my ceiling and leaked into apartment. When the ceiling was repaired, they required me to leave the premises, which violates tenant law. 
- After moving out, the cleaning and repair charges magically added up exactly to my total security deposit. I had done no damage to this unit.

Flooding frequently occured in the basement, across multiple units.

I realized that this was almost definitely some kind of scam he was running as I talked to another tenant in the same building who was also given an extremely high utilities bill by him while moving out. He tried to extort money from the other tenant; I refused and suggested that we met later in the month to sort it out in good faith. Sensing that I called his bluff, he never showed up.",1,1,3,1,1

Their pricing is infuriating - many of us long time residents are being told with a straight face to keep paying $1300 a month or more while new residents are paying a starting rate of just over $900. They constantly have turnover with maintenance staff and property managers, yet the only thing that is consistent is the owners seeing their bank accounts grow. They're open about forcing out as many people as they can in order to bring in Christian couples of a very specific type, although they do not directly advertise this. They're also quick to evict - they post demand letters of you are a day late past the 2nd on rent. The security doors that were installed by a previous company are busted and wide open for much of the year and their lease agreement literally has residents signing away the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases in exchange for housing.

There were also massive cracks in the walls. Steve Brown simply doesn't maintain their buildings, and it's a shame, because their buildings could be beautiful and worth the price - we *loved* the look of our apartment, but there were so many things wrong with it! Once, a massive water leak in the garage, which was spraying water all over peoples' cars, took multiple days to fix - and the fix was duct tape! They had to come back out and fix it again shortly after! It took us months to get a new washer and dryer, months to get a ceiling fan, and so on.

Given that they had no legal obligation to do so, I think that was more than fair. The property was always nicely kept and management was friendly and reasonably responsive, but maintenance was sometimes slow.

We had multiple instances of termites in our apartment, and despite reporting them, they failed to ever fully take care of the problem - their loss if the building ends up falling down.

Finally, they are incredibly predatory on move out. The Axiom La Jolla complex in San Diego primarily houses college students at UCSD. They'll lure you in with a cheap security deposit, and at the end of the lease, threaten to take all of it back unless you pay for them to perform a deep-clean despite you doing your own cleaning prior to moving out. If that sounds illegal to you, that's because it is - we just didn't want to spend the time or money to fight them in court as our time was worth more to us than what we lost.

Over 3 years we had only one inspection which was the final, PM was very easy on this so he gets top marks for privacy and respect. He only ever contacted if rent was late and was never pushy or aggressive.

PM also gave us a 25% rent reduction over the lockdowns which was very nice but unfortunately when we decided to end the lease he tried to bill us all the rent concessions he gave over the lockdowns. It came to about $5k which was a shock, I told he we had it in writing that it was a concession and that we also had no money, he dropped it to $1500, still very disappointing. He also told me ""we all struggled over COVID"" while standing next to a $100k Mercedes, marked down for respect on that one.

The dog would be barking so much that there were several times I had to leave my own home to be at peace. It got so bad that I even opened two investigations with animal services because Shelley believed she was above the bylaws. 

She lied to me for eight months about relocating the dog, since it came from the parents’ of the tenants home it wouldn’t have been a big deal. 

There were mice in the building at 216 Princess which made it all the way up to my third floor unit, urinating in my bedroom. She also does not enforce dog owners to clean up in the dog run, or keep their animals at a reasonable volume like the lease agreement requires. 

During my one year at 216 Princess, Carriage Works, Shelley allowed my neighbour to break three sections of the lease agreement daily. Once she is asked to do her job, good luck getting anything from her. 

She also attempted to affect my future living situations, by telling landlords calling fire references that I’m “difficult to deal with when unhappy”, but not explaining that her lies, negligence, and refusal to do the bare minimum of her job was the reason.

Here are some of the good points, they do repairs fairly quickly and the exterminator come in the week if units have any issues.

However the building itself is slowly decaying, while they have fixed cosmetic issues outside and inside the building, the garage need to be redone, the automatic door opener needs to be changed, the doors need to be changed, the elevator needs to be change.  

The pool was out of service since 2021, as the filtering system and heating system wasn't working anymore.

In 2022 there was critical damage to it where, enough water or ice got under it and the pool just lifted at least a meter on one side, damaging the whole room, it's been 2 years and nothing is being done about it.

There is a lot of unfinished work in the building because they don't pay their contractor in a timely manner, contractor start the job, and 2 weeks later don't get their money so they just leave everything there.

They raised the price of the rent year after year, never missing a beat, and also, in 2023, double the price of all parking space and now want to charge for Storage space, a place where pipe might burst, is dimly lit, and is not locked or have any securities.

That stairwell didn’t have drainage at the bottom so about 40 gallons of water came into my room whenever it would rain. They never did anything about it and so I complained to the city.

-the apartment was not cleaned before we moved in, we had to do it. It was disgusting.
-the flooring was basically peel and stick and started to bubble up within the first year we moved in
-there was holes in every window screen
-we had a live, active leak in the laundry room for WEEKS. The only plumber they’d use was OVER RUN with emergency calls and kept cancelling. They refused to hire someone else. I have countless pictures and videos of my kitchen and laundry room flooding with water all day. I would have to call off work to wait THE ENTIRE DAY just in case the plumber showed up. Neither B2b nor the plumber would answer my calls. 
-when the leak was fixed we found out that the property management company let maintenance put DRYWALL over a VALVE. THERE WAS NO ACCESS PANEL. The water shut-off was on the other side (it was a duplex) and we couldn’t get in touch with neighbors nor B2B to get to it, so the guy had cut into the wall and cap the valve LIVE. 
-they didn’t include appliances but tried to say in the lease that anything we installed had to stay with the house
-the furnace went out during the first winter and I had to call the emergency line to talk to someone after three days of below freezing weather out of concern for my pets. 
-they only let you pay online but charge a fee for “online convenience” 
-we were supposed to do a walk-through of the place before we moved in but they never showed up and nobody answered when we tried to call. 
-I cannot stress enough that they are UNAVAILABLE. THEY WILL NOT GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING. When we moved in, we didn’t have a trash can. The city provides them but ours was missing. We weren’t able to put in a ticket for one due to not owning the property. It took nearly 8 months for us to get a trash can. Weeks to even get them to put in the ticket.
-they tried to give less than a 24 hour notice for needing to enter the house. I said no because I had to work, they tried to tell me that they’d just let themselves in. They became rude when I stated I’d rather be there for people entering and exiting the house. I have animals and do not trust people to not let them out nor do I feel comfortable with people (they never even said who) coming into my house when I’m not there???

It was nearly impossible to get in touch with these people for any reason, they just did not care. I like a hands-off approach, but they literally were never in the office nor did they check their messages or emails. They sent me a number to text but that rarely generated a response either, and if it did it was 2 business days later and answered nothing.

3271,CHUCK RICH PROPERTIES,JOHNSON CITY,TENNESSEE,37604,US,"I have a few complaints. 
1. Rent has been raised every year, despite any increase in living conditions.
2. Maintenance is lazy. For example, the wall of a building in the complex fell off last year, it has only now been completed. Maintenance sit around all day, smoking cigarettes and throwing the butts and cartons all around the complex. They also leave bottles, cups, tarps, and other various pieces of trash strewn about. Additionally, their workmanship on the wall has been horrible, they left large clumps of stucco all over the ground and the wall looks terrible in general.
2. Maintenance parks their vehicles in the very limited parking spaces. 
3. Maintenance wear Trump hats and apparel regularly, and they stare/watch all tenants as they come and go. It is very unnerving and creepy. 
4. Very few non-white people live in the complex, which is unusual since the area of town is near a university and pretty diverse. I suspect their is an element of racial discrimination, but as a white person I cannot confirm. So, just be ware.",2,3,2,4,2

3295,JESSICA LIEDERBACH,OLYMPIA,WASHINGTON,98502,US,"I rented a property from Jessica about a year ago.  Communication from the get go was pretty frustrating. She wasn't very communicative and I had to put in a lot of effort on my end after the application was approved to find out details about where to pay the deposit and when to expect the lease to be sent over and signed. The keys were given 2-3 days after we had agreed which made our move more difficult. When we moved in the fridge had mold and thankfully that was cleaned immediately and all was well. When our water heater went out- that also was replaced in a timely manner. 

However, when I discovered mold in the unit in on one of the walls and immediately informed her - she seemed to not really be interested in coming to see it. The solutions she offered would have spread mold around the house and she didn't actually come look at it until 3 months later - despite me sending several emails and photos informing her that it was growing and seemed to be from moisture inside the wall (indicating a leak). She was very hard to get ahold of - which I found out was due to her being out of the country on vacation (and hadn't informed us in advance). She also gaslit me several times - insisting it was something I had done - despite taking ages to come see the issue in person and repeatedly ignoring my texts and emails expressing this was an urgent situation that needed to be addressed.

She finally agreed to have a professional mold remediation expert come look at it at my insistence. He agreed it was structural - but she still insisted on just cleaning the wall and painting over it rather than go with proper remediation thay was recommended by a professional. She got quite stern with me when I insisted painting over it wasnt proper repairs and told me that proper remediation would require us to end our tenancy (even though it would take at most 72 hours by professionals and wouldn't only keep one room unable to be used). She had someone scrub the wall and paint over it after this interaction. 

We opted to amicably end the lease earlier than planned and she agreed to not charge us and gave us back our deposit. However the whole situation and how she handled it caused myself and my roomare great emotional distress - not to mention the time we spent cleaning mold growing in other places due to the major moisture issues in the home despite running fans and other efforts to avoid these problems. 

She insisted they would properly remediate the mold once we left - however the property was posted soon after we moved and tenants were moved in less than a month later.

REPAIRS: 
My main complaint is the air conditioning being so unpredictable. The complex I live at operates on a boiler/chiller system, which the landlord did not feel the need to switch to chiller until March when the temperatures had been above 80° for two weeks already. My roommate and I had been sleeping with the windows open every night because being in the apartment was so miserable. 
I put in a request for a part of my front door to be fixed, and the door wouldn’t stay shut or lock because the “fix” made the door no longer fit in the frame. When I told the leasing office this, they told me it was not an emergency that my door wouldn’t shut or lock and that I would be fortunate to get someone out to fix it by the end of the day. I had to go to the leasing office crying because I was going to miss a final exam for them to finally make a phone call and get someone out to fix it. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY:
The units are full of roaches, some units have mold in them but the landlords tell maintenance that they “aren’t allowed to say that word,” and that they would prefer if the mold were referred to as, “organic growth.” There was a man murdered at the complex and the nearby university put out a statement while Valiant stayed silent. Despite this man being murdered and there being obvious safety concerns, there are still no lights or cameras in the parking lot. 

Valiant residential owns multiple complexes in Denton, Texas through the company Denton Student Apartments and I have heard similar complaints from people that I know that are leasing with them.

3305,MONICA ROBINSON,WOODSTOCK,GEORGIA,30188,US,"Monica neglected to cut down a tree after she had been notified it was dead. It later fell over and crushed our car and destroyed the porch (narrowly missing the house. If it had fallen just a couple feet to the right, it would have killed my wife.) Monica's response when we told her via text? ""I'm not liable."" She was, but suing her wasn't worth the headache. It took months to have the porch repaired and we had to use the backdoor to get in and out of the house.

Monica kept hiring sketchy guys she found on Craig's List to do repairs. Clearly not bonded or licensed or anything. Just random dudes. One dismantled the bathtub and left, never to be seen again. The tub was never repaired and Monica attempted to keep the security deposit over it. She was thrilled when she found the damage and devastated when we told her the handyman she hired did it. She did not keep our security deposit in escrow (illegal) and needed several weeks to scrounge up the money after we moved out. Again, suing her wasn't worth the headache. Monica told us she had some seventeen properties or so scattered across the area. It became apparent that they bought up all these properties at once (obviously expecting immediate and sizable ""passive income"") and stretched themselves too thin financially. Money for repairs was always an issue and odd things didn't match, like our light switches. She eventually told us they were salvaging parts from other homes and yard sales and so on. Some of their other properties apparently had different interior doors that didn't completely fit the door frames. Real ramshackle stuff.

She frequently showed up without notice for sudden improvements (like painting the porch) which was in violation of the lease. We repeatedly had to tell her we needed at least 24 hours before she could come over. We had to explain to Monica that even though she owned the house, it was our home and she couldn't just barge in and interrupt our lives whenever she liked. She never really grasped that. We once caught her hiding in the garage.

The house's foundation was shifting so she installed a sump pump in the garage (the least efficient yet cheapest option). Naturally, the power bill shot up and we were stuck with it. Before you ask: yes, she did show up several times with different contractors to check things out without any notice. ""Hey, here's a crowd of strangers in your garage. Surprise!""

Here's a story: Monica showed up out of the blue one day to paint the porch. She never told us she was planning to paint it, much less when. I was at work and my wife was terribly ill and couldn't really get out of bed. Having Monica just on the other side of the wall blasting music while painting wasn't exactly helpful. At some point, Monica knocked on the door (the master bedroom opened to the back porch), but it didn't really register with my wife that she heard knocking (again, VERY ill). Maybe an hour later, it clicked that she'd heard knocking, so she got up and went to the door: ""Hey, were you knocking earlier?"" Apparently, Monica had needed to use the bathroom. She came in, went to the bathroom for maybe five seconds, and then left with an embarrassed look on her face. Pretty weird, but she was nuts so whatever. Later that day, we were in the yard and our dog discovered something.

Monica had pooped under our porch.",1,1,1,1,1

After informing them that I’d like to discuss these matters before paying my rent they began threatening me as if I had no rights as a tenant to a clean home. As the time progressed there were maggots in the garage(no one uses the garage besides them). Our basement flooded and we asked them to reduce our rent for that month since 7 of us had to use 1 kitchen that had no dishwasher and only 1 working stove. They refused to even come in person to meet with us and declined to reduce the rent. Furthermore I asked to park in the drive way since I got a car and they said I’d have to pay. I was perfectly fine with that as it’s listed in the agreement BUT they decided to increase the price for parking including an inconvenience fee for when they came to the house (there are no other cars parked in the driveway and could hv easily parked next to mine). They also threatened to kick us out when we wanted to discuss our rent when the house flooded. They treated us as if we had no rights and should keep our mouth shut even though the living conditions were worse then any form I’ve been in (I’ve seen some terrible dorms). They were so rude and tried taking advantage of us just because we’re students. Like we have no right to stable living conditions just because of that. Additionally any email we sent was replied to with a formal tone scrutinizing the littlest of details filled with passive aggressive threats. The landlord is a psychologist and to think she would be manipulating and abusing her rights over young students should be considered against the exact oath she sore to. The day of clean out they talked down on me and the my other house mates infront of our parents because the house wasn’t as clean to their liking. Yet when we moved in the house was a mess, there were earwings and insects all around and as I said before food and crumbs on the floor. Yet they seemed to all of a sudden expect us to clean more when the living conditions the house was given in was FAR worse then what we tried our best to keep it as. Also they are very sly and sneaky and will visit without giving notice. They violated several tenant act agreement rights KNOWING that tenants have more rights than landlords yet abused their power simply on the bases that we are students and easy to take advantage of.

This fall will be my third year living here and each year that I've lived here, they've increased my rent. When I moved into my 1 bedroom 1 bath w/ dishwasher unit, my rent was $895/month. The next year they increased it to $945, and this year they increased it to $1045. They have done ZERO updates to the unit since I've moved in, and I unfortunately had a bad experience with them regarding a pakage theft issue in my building.

Last year, we were having a package theft issue and I asked B&B to install cameras in our foyer, even fake ones would've done the job because they would've at least deterred the thief. B&B instead chose to blame tenants for leaving the security door to the foyer open. I told B&B that this wasn't what was happening. The foyer door was being kept open because at the time, B&B's maintenance crew was renovating the unit down the hall for me. The maintenance crew would constantly leave and re-enter the building, and instead of wanting to unlock the door each time, they left it cracked instead. That's besides the point though, because I figured out that the thief was someone who lived IN our building. I ordered a $300 dress just before we were notified about the package stealing. The thief took my package, and then a day or so later, I found it thrown in the hallway of the building when I took my trash out at 10pm. If the thief was someone from outside the building, as B&B told us, why would they have come back to the scene of their crime to throw my dress in the hallway...and to get back into the hallway, they would've had to have a key to get passed the security door so late at night when the maintenance crew wasnt there. The only people who have security door keys are the tenants. All that in mind, I deduced that it was a male resident within our building who was taking the packages. I unfortunately never discovered who exactly the thief was, but the theft did stop, no thanks to B&B. I'm lucky that the thief was a male tenant who wasn't interested in my dress. Other tenants weren't so lucky and never got their belongings back. Our building still does not have a camera to protect against theft.

I also found a mouse trap in our laundry room and soon after I found it, the tenants in my building all received an email about how the pest problem was our fault because we must've been keeping the security door open. Once again, I told B&B that it wasn't tenants, but their own maintenance crew who was keeping the door cracked so they wouldn't have to keep using their key to go back and forth to their van for supplies. B&B of course, has never actually been accountable for problems caused by their own employees. They did respond to my emails telling them that it was the maintenace crew, but they never sent out any emails apologizing to the tenants for blaming us for a theft & pest problem that we weren't responsible for. B&B is not the type of landlord to admit when they've said/done something wrong.

Aside from those issues, living under B&B's roof hasn't been that bad, but I say that as someone who could afford each of the rent increases. When asked about the increases, B&B just blamed ""inflation"". If they try to increase it again next January when they ask if I'm resigning my lease, I'll be moving out. I've never lived under a landlord who increased the rent every single year that I've lived there, with 0 updates to the unit. I've lived here for almost three years and for the first time ever, I saw them update the building a bit by changing the tile floors in the laundry room and adding a ""maintenance room"" sign to the maintenance door (lol). The one positive thing I can say about them is that they will respond to your emails and maintenance has always come the next day, sometimes even the same day, to fix any issues I've had.",5,3,1,5,3

First off they switched our apartment on the day of move-in & told us that it was under ""emergency repair whenever they just rented it out to someone else. They had us paying for their electricity for a couple of months too.

This place had no warm water. You split the water bill with all the tenants & we had neighbors who would take a bath every day. Warm water was first come first serve so if you happen to shower late for whatever reason it would be cold water.

The place was infested with roaches because of sewage issues. I was sweeping roaches in the morning before work, after work, and before bed. We had no food left out or anything. I would wake up with roaches in my hair, in our food, etc.

Maintenance would fix things very carelessly or lie about completing work orders. We had cameras to prove things were never fixed.

I had a package stolen and the front office didn't care at all. 

The manager there Tonya Smith is very fake. She will act like she cares and then straight up ignore you. The front office people are also rude and disrespectful. 

When we first moved in the ceiling was leaking water for a couple days. We notified them immediately and they waited until past the weekend to fix it.

Trash valet came when they wanted. So, raccoons and cats would always rip through the trash then the apartment tried to fine the tenants.

They would let towing companies illegally tow you because they had an illegal towing lane that I reported them for and got them in trouble LOL. 

Everything was missing a drawer or handle and when maintenance came to fix it they would put it on backwards or it would be completely different from other ones. 

They have a theft problem for the last 5 years or more.

It sat broken for 4 years and is probably still like that to this day. I had several other tenets try to break into my apartment because they would give names and unit numbers of people who complained.

I stayed on them calling once a week checking when/ how an appointment would be made and by the third call I was told they do request in an honestly crazy way. They will do all the non scheduled ones and then they will contact to make appointments once there’s no others. And as I previously stated they still never made an appointment and instead just show up on the last legal date to make a repair before I can take action. 

Beyond maintenance lacking. They also put “official” notices out by taping a note to your door( no dates or signatures). The notices are uhm crazy sometimes. One winter the building was given notices but only to some and it was regarding if a pipe were to burst all tenants with a visibly open window will have a major fee and also have to pay for repairs. When I called to inquire I was told they quite literally went around to units with open windows only, and were very ignorant of any questions or concerns I had. I mentioned how could they tell if a unit caused a pipe to burst (the pipe under a total of 16 units) and was met with no answer but instead ranting about how it could cause frozen pipes. I also mentioned my unit is on the upper floor and the pipe is in the basement so it wouldn’t make sense for the upper floors to be a concern. Again a rant about frozen pipes. Also being on an upper floor in the winter means all the heat from the below units rise to mine as well as the heat being generated in my unit makes a very warm place and the window in question is open at night to let heat out from the sauna of the bedroom and re closed in the morning.

To address the first issue, in 2023, I have encountered nearly a month's worth of days without heat in my building. NRM responded to this uninhabitable situation by attempting to put a bandaid on the problem (i.e., fixing the very old boiler again and again instead of just replacing it). Moreover, NRM did not adequately communicate with myself and my neighbors on updates to this issue unless I continuously contacted them to demand information. To address the second issue, NRM left a faulty pipe installed in my oven. Upon attempting to use my oven, sparks originated from a break in the pipe that I was not aware of, an issue that very fortunately did not turn into a fire or an explosion. NRM did not inform me of this, nor did they rush to fix the issue, as it took them 4 months to complete my work order for the issue.

He tried to scam us out of our deposit but eventually caved once we called him out for having double standards. In top of this he didn’t repair things when we brought them up to him (doors, dishwasher, washer and dryer) 

The reason we left was he threatened to evict us with no grounds. He tried to give us 30 days instead of serving us a real eviction. I ended up having to pull tenant rights up and let him know I’d take him to court if he didn’t give us our rent back, pay for our moving truck, and reimburse us for the rugs he requested we bought.

3399,BILL KIRIAKIDIS,SANTA BARBARA,CALIFORNIA,93101,US,"I would advise against renting from Bill and Stacy.  The unit above their garage was pretty miserable to live in. Issues included:

1. Leaky roof that we waited a week or more to get fixed, only for the bad patch job to leak again.
2. Gasoline was spilled in the garage at one point, due to poor insulation fumes filled the apartment for almost 2 weeks
3. Wall heaters pilot light would keep going out, approximately 3 times per day. Texting the landlord, received no response back.
4. Was paid deposit back late, more than 21 says after vacating the property. Upon attempting to contact him multiple times per day and being ignored, I called from a different phone number and Bill answered immediately. He also didn't remember how much we had paid and asked us to provide proof that the check we wrote was for first month, last month, and a security deposit.
5. Deposit was not fully returned, even though it was normal wear and tear to the carpet in terms of foot traffic (peak covid pandemic required us to stay home)
6. Landlord had a muscle car that he would work on in the garage with a very loud engine. When the car was started in the garage, the entire unit would vibrate and you could smell the fumes (the unit was extremely hot due to having no attic space and poor insulation, so the windows were open often)
7. Electricity in the unit needed serious work. The circuit was damaged to the point that the lights in the stairway and walkway would flicker constantly. Turns out, the wires were paired together in a wire nut that was never twisted. I had to contact an electrician myself because the electrician the landlord sent was just a handyman who didn't know how to fix it.
8. Had a pretty serious leak coming from the bathtub faucet, due to a bad cartridge. When asked to contact a plumber, was consistently ignored. Finally after much back-and-forth, I called a plumber myself and got it fixed. 
9. The closet attached to the bathroom had a piece of plywood attached to the wall that was closing up a hole into the main house's attic space. Hot air sitting in their attic space would pump into the unit from between the wall and the plywood.

Overall, I would absolutely would never recommend anyone live here, or rent from Bill. Not only were the conditions unhospitable in that apartment, but the landlord himself violated California Security Deposit law, and actively ignored maintenence requests. A very difficult landlord to work with, down to the last detail.

There was no cleaning, there were no inspections of how the place was looking, the apartment building ended up getting bed bugs as a result of how poorly the place was being looked after.

They have a few professional handymen but they are reluctant to send them on ""small jobs"" - they are often working larger renovation projects on other properties. I have received DIY YouTube trained handymen instead, which is fine for replacing a broken plastic door handle. I suggest you formally request a senior experienced handymen if you require a more sensitive repair.

Lastly, their tenant contact person Melissa is without doubt the most toxic person on the team you will have the misfortune of communicating with. She will gaslight you. She will deflect blame. She will always choose the cheapest option. She is lazy and never keeps any records. You will need to bypass her incompetence and work directly with her seniors to accomplish anything. Her seniors have been more professional, respectful, and offer quicker acceptable solutions.",2,4,3,5,3

The tradeoff is that Ms Fletcher does not care what goes on in her U-district property, and the rent is [relatively] affordable.

3424,RP MANAGEMENT,"BASED IN WYNNEWOOD, APARTMENTS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN PA",PENNSYLVANIA,19096,US,"Lived in 2 RP owned complexes (Cedar Glen in Allentown and Wynnewood Park in Reading). Cedar Glen was honestly pretty nice. Everything was in working order, no mold. Got our full security deposit back with no hassle. Because we liked Cedar Glen so much, when we moved to Reading we looked at several RP-owned complexes and chose Wynnewood Park for the location and beautiful tree grove. We had several issues there. Our fridge died twice within a span of 3-4 months, costing us hundreds in ruined groceries, which RP “reimbursed” us for with a $50 grocery gift card. According to their own repairmen, every fridge in that property needs replaced approximately once per year. There was also an incident early on when they sent a repairman into our apartment with absolutely no notice. I (a young woman) was home alone sitting on the balcony, and turned around to see a man in the apartment. Startling to say the least. The worst part is that the repairman was under the impression that they HAD given us the proper 24 hours’ notice. This was just the beginning.

In November of 2020, we put a down payment on a house and notified the property manager that we would be moving out ASAP. They told us they needed 90 days’ notice as per the lease, so we agreed to pay both rent and mortgage for 3 months until the lease was up in February, putting us in a very tight financial situation. A couple weeks before the lease was up, we sent them a cordial email letting them know that we were all moved out and thanking them for everything. They said that we had never “confirmed” that we were not renewing the lease (even though, on top of the email communications from November, they had sent us a paper letter the prior summer asking if we were planning on renewing our lease and we said no then, too, so they had been notified TWICE that we were not renewing the lease). So they auto-renewed our lease without our consent, and then told us if we wanted to end it we would have to pay a lease break fee equivalent to another month’s rent. When we challenged them on this, they told us “as a favor” they would allow us to break the lease without a fee if one of us could get a doctor’s note saying we could no longer live there, which, thankfully, we were able to do as the situation was causing so much stress that it was negatively impacting our mental health. 
After that, they not only kept our security deposit, but also sent us us a bill for $800 for repairs, which seemed retaliatory considering we left that place in perfectly fine condition, better condition than we left Cedar Glen in, where we got our full security deposit back with no issues.",2,3,1,3,4

I could see metal particulates in the water, and called to have it addressed. Their contractor sent a tech to test the water, and then the contractor assured me the water was fine but refused to give me a copy of the report. RPA did give me the report when I asked, and showed my water was a PH of 4 - that’s over 100 times more acidic than the legal limit. I had to get a written letter from Seattle Utilities to get RPA to take action to address the issue - all it took was replacing the pipes under our sink. 
Fast forward to 2023, when I was looking for another new place to rent, I contacted multiple RPA listings. However, the company never got back to me, even as they continued to post new ads for the same listing. This leads me to believe I have been blacklisted from RPA managed properties, because I forced them to fix my pipes so that my water would be drinkable.

3439,Q RESIDENTIAL,ST CATHARINES,ONTARIO,L2N 6T3,CA,"Repairs : It's a corporately held building that since we moved in has gone downhill precipitously. I have encountered problems getting Residential Managers to get things done, often taking a week or more from reporting an issue to receiving assistance. Most recently it was a problem of the sinks in the kitchen not draining. I was having to bail out my sinks like the US has to bail out banks... It took 2 weeks to get a plumber in to fix it, and when he did, it took him about 10 minutes to fix the issue. He also fixed my water pressure issue, no idea how he did it, but he went to ""the mechanical room"" and when he came back, my water pressure was almost back to where it was when we moved in. Pool was closed during COVID, which I understood, but didn't reopen (not because of repairs) until the last week of summer last year, and was open for that ONE WEEK. The pool was the only reason we took this apartment.

Health and Safety: Never had cockroaches before... Just killed my first one in my kitchen today. Black mold on the bedroom ceilings in the winter. Only goes away if I run my Air Conditioner all summer, but inevitably comes back after a few weeks of fall weather.

Rent Stability: Oh the rent is stable. Stable on the increase every year. Whether or not they've done ANY repairs. 

Tenant Privacy Rating: The building has ONE Residential Manager. When I moved in we had 3... She's ill, and is breaking down from having no help for going on 8 months (since our last Residential Manager retired). And is supposed to be not working after April 30th. And as of April 29 she has not been replaced. Our Residential Managers have all been amazing, but one by one, they fell, and no replacements were found... Guess we have no one to call for repairs and such as of May 1st...  They are good about not being overly intrusive with me. But. I think they know better than to bug me too much.

Respect: I don't feel respected when they raise my rent for no reason, cut the amenities, and don't replace the people who make living here easier.

When we were moving a few days early before the move out date, he came into our apartment and threw out a bunch of our stuff onto the curb, even though we weren’t done moving yet and we still were on the lease for another 5 days!!

3454,AMERICAN LANDMARK,BEDFORD,TEXAS,76021,US,"My roommate and I have been living at this property for a year, this is both our first apartment and the leasing office did not make it easy for us to understand what was necessary to provide or the deadlines for when we were to hand over specific information or documentation. My roommate actually got charged the entirety of our first month of rent before we even moved in or payed the deposit because she signed up to their residential portal after they informed us of our accounts.

Trying to get into the unit before we moved in just to see its condition was a nightmare. I don't know if we were purposely strung along or if the leasing agent was born yesterday but it seemed like every conversation and email had a different answer, one day we'd have permission to look at the unit after a certain week, the next day we'd have to schedule an appointment or just wait until we moved in. The information changed several times and we were utterly confused until my roommates mom got involved and essentially forced our agent to stick to a story through sheer force of will.

Our move in date changed twice, at first it was in June and they needed a couple of days to clean up after the last tenant, then that changed to a week so that the carpet could be replaced, then our move in date settled in July because of ""cleaning and matinance repairs"". That was fine but it was always at the last minute, we'd be getting ready to load up our furniture and an email or a call would come in. Just frustrating all around.

The unit wasn't 100% when we got in either. The fridge was missing shelves, our dishwasher didn't work, there was a foundation crack in the wall, and a four foot by six foot growth of mold in the outside storage area that they still haven't, in a years time, come to clean up. Also only half of each electrical outlet works, either the top or bottom, never both. 

Our lease itself is very unforgiving, if we're late on paying electricity or any ""vital"" utilities, that's seen as us defaulting and grounds for eviction. Here's the exact wording ""If you are late in paying the water bill, we may not cut off your water; but we may immediately exercise all other lawful remedies, including eviction—just like late payment of rent."" Also we have to agree to let them come inside whenever and for whatever they want, which isn't ideal but it's also the only option when trying to get something repaired, we had to get someone to come and fix our dishwasher twice.

Other than all of that and the complete lack of soundproofing, it's a pretty good apartment complex and the people working in the leasing office are willing to work with you as long as you physically go to the office during their open hours or send an email, they don't even have an option to speak with them over the phone when you call. We're going to stay here another year, we don't want to uproot and the rent offer they sent for renewal hasn't increased so its most likely our best option.

The unit itself is a two bedroom two bath 876 square foot space with washer and dryer hookup for $1,591 per month and an additional $80 for trash pickup, common area fees, amenity fees, and water allocation. There were only two options we could go with for internet AT&T and Spectrum, it was repeatedly advised that we sign with AT&T so we went to Spectrum. Our electricity was our responsibility and we got a great deal for a year of 13.4 cents per kwh, renewed just last week for 10.3. 

All in all it's frustrating to try and communicate with the office but it's not a bad place to live, I'd say the unforgiving lease would've made me turn away had I not needed somewhere to move asap. We needed a credit check of course, renters insurance of $300,000, and our total household income needed to be 3x that of rent which we made by the skin of our teeth but since I work overtime we just qualified. There was an approval fee of $150, an online application fee of $150, and a move in fee of, yes you guessed it, $150. We also had to delete and unsubscribe from accounts for a couple of services they signed us up for since they cost about $10 a month each.

There was an original flatmate was living there already. Moved in with another peer, we quickly understood how bad the situation was. The other flatmate was a drunk and alcoholic, prone to violent outbursts. The house walls were really thin and freedom to move and come back late at night (10 pm due to commuting and working in central, finishing my shit at 8.30/9 pm) was really limited. The landlord who clearly favoured this original male tenant, did not bat an eye when I made it known he had already threatened me and took no action whatsoever. When this flatmate threatened me in the middle of the night, when I was trying to fall asleep in the living room (I used to sleep there sometimes since I liked to watch movies there which was downstairs), he bursted in the room and threatened me to ‘break my head in half’ with a baseball bat he had conveniently with him. When I made known this other issue to the landlord, he did not take any action. I went back to my home country for the holidays and out of the blue I got a message OUT OF THE BLUE!! Telling me I was evicted because i did not match the lifestyle of the original tenant. Mind you he moved in one month before me. I called the police on the baseball bat event and he did not care whatsoever. Went back and forth for my deposit since I forgot to put on some curtains, and insisted to get my money back.

3475,MIKE CAMAJ,LONG BEACH,CALIFORNIA,90813,US,"Mike, while a seemingly nice enough guy to your face, is a borderline horrendous landlord. He purchased the property I used to live in halfway through my 10 year tenure there, and in this five years raised the rent every single year by the maximum amount allowed by the law. You would think he would have used that increased income to upgrade or at least maintain the 8-unit property, but as time went on, repairs were never done, improvements to the property were nonexistent, and more and more issues just kept popping up. When the security gates broke, he made the bare minimum effort to fix them, so as when they broke again just a few weeks later he never bothered to fix them again. There was a laundry unit in the facility, but the machines were so used and barely functional that all the residents in the building ended up going to laundromats in the area unless it was an emergency. Lights around the property would often go broken for weeks or months before he fixed them. And when the gate to the parking garage was damaged due to an accident, his idea of a repair was to get a chain and padlock to reach from the gate post to the gate as it no longer would close all the way. But worst of all, especially for me and my family, was when the upstairs apartment had a water pipe burst and there was subsequent water damage done to my ceiling and kitchen walls, he came in and removed the water damaged areas but left them open, promising to come and fix/repair then soon... but 14 months later, until I moved out, he never came in to fix them. Then, as I was trying to move my family and I out of that place to someplace better and bigger, I found out from one potential renter that he had told them not to rent to me because I never paid my rent on time any of the months that he rented to me. But I had five years worth of cashiers checks receipts to prove he was lying - which I showed to the new property manager I was talking to, and who immediately accepted my application. But before that property manager told me that, I had been rejected by at least half a dozen other places. So I figure he was telling them the same lie each and every time they contacted him. I mean, I had a steady job with the local government agency that I had been at for 15 years, my wife had a steady job for the past 10 years, and we were making more than 5x the recommended income. So we were perplexed as to why we couldn't find a new place. All until this property manager actually told me why he wouldn't rent to me and my family. If you ever come across a property owned by Mike Camaj, I would highly recommend not applying with him.

The office staff have been kind and understanding for us— specifically when one of our previous roommates used their military paperwork to force themselves off of the lease without telling us.

Our apartment specifically isn’t renovated like others because of how quick we had to move, so I can’t speak on the new apartments. They haven’t jacked the price of rent with inflation being an issue, so that’s appreciated. For what we pay, which isn’t a lot, it’s a solid choice.

3497,NEVADA COMMERCIAL SERVICES,RENO,NEVADA,89502,US,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY
I currently rent a home from this company and they are quite possibly the WORST rental company I have ever rented from. We moved in around the 2nd week of July 2019 and let our previous landlords know we would be gone by July 10th. The day we did our walk through, we noticed a giant puddle of water on the ground in the bedroom that my boyfriend would be living in. The next day was our move in day and NCS called us and told us that we would not be able to move in anymore due to the leakage issue. I have rented homes and apartments in the past and thought it was quite odd that they didn't conduct a full inspection before renting out a home. We found out quite fast that they clearly hadn't inspected the home for damage or maintenance issues before deciding to let us rent and live in the house. Unfortunately, we had already turned in our keys to our old place and weren't able to stay extra time so Vanessa Wood, our property manager, told us to move our things in anyhow and to just leave the room with the leaking roof empty for the time being. How convenient. Once the leaking issue was fixed a couple of days later (July 12), my boyfriend moved his things into the bedroom and we thought our issues were over. We thought wrong. My boyfriend quickly discovered that the electricity in his room didn't work out of any of the outlets so naturally we called NCS and informed them that the electricity didn't work in that bedroom. NCS didn't fix the electricity in that bedroom for almost 2 weeks after being notified. So all in all, my boyfriend wasn't able to move into his bedroom for about 16 days after our projected move in date which was on July 10th. 

On the same day that we notified NCS about our electricity trouble, Waste Management stopped by to take our trash and informed us that our trash can was too heavy and they wouldn't be able to dispose of it. We were curious why our garbage can was so heavy and we discovered that when NCS came to do yard cleanup before we moved in, they disposed of the green waste in our garbage can making it too heavy for WM to take. I informed Vanessa Wood of this issue on July 23rd including photo evidence. The green waste collected in our garbage can was not removed for three days after on July 26th making it impossible to remove any trash on our property for three days due to our garbage can being so full. 
The next issue we ran into was discovered when we were informed that we were responsible for all yard maintenance which is expected when you rent a property. Unfortunately, we discovered that the water spout for our garden hose does not work. After informing NCS they came to the conclusion that the spout did not need replacing and would not come to fix it. Water spout still does not work. 
On August 22nd I texted our property manager Vanessa Wood and informed her that the night before (August 21st) we had to have emergency maintenance come out due to our kitchen sink overflowing and the ceiling in the kitchen was leaking water. I submitted a formal maintenance request on August 22nd  and was informed that maintenance would be out to fix the sink issue from 1-5pm. Surprisingly no one showed up. We spent the next week calling and chasing down NCS to come fix our sink. Our sink was not fixed until August 29th a WEEK after submitting  a formal maintenance request. Unfortunately there is no dishwasher in our kitchen and we were unable to use/wash dishes for a week which is incredibly inconvenient. 
As for the ceiling leaking, maintenance has come to look at our ceiling about 7 or 8 times now in the past 5 months. Every time there is a leak, we notify our property manager/submit a maintenance request. Oftentimes if we don't call NCS two or three times, they will not call us back. Most recently my boyfriend and I were traveling and maintenance was scheduled to come FINALLY fix our leaking ceiling (after 5 months) on December 30th 2019. When we arrived home, there was a nice puddle of water greeting us on our kitchen floor. Although we gave permission for maintenance to enter without us being home prior to our appointment on 12/30, apparently the maintenance people could not enter since no one was home. Funny thing is, my mother was staying at our home to make sure maintenance showed up and she informed me that she was there all day 12/30 and no one had come to the door. After I told them that, they let me know they refused to enter because my mom was there with her service dog. After rescheduling, maintenance FINALLY figured out the leak issue. 
Fast forward to October of 2020, we had resigned our lease back in 07/2020 with the same four roommates. Vanessa Wood our property manager calls my boyfriend & I up informing us that we must sign a roommate release form to release another roommate from the lease. We were uncomfortable with signing being that we had no idea another roommate was leaving and did not know where we would make up the missing rent, along with having no idea who the fourth roommate would be as we never met them before. Vanessa Wood proceeded to illegally threaten us with a “breach of contract” for not signing the roommate release and not signing the other person on. My father happens to be a real estate agent and informed me that I was within my legal rights not to sign any type of roommate release form since I never agreed to in the first place. Vanessa Wood then handed out my phone number and my fathers phone number to the other roommate’s parent’s without our consent which is actually a violation of our lease agreement. Vanessa Wood illegally threatened to evict us for not signing a form that we had never agreed to signing. 

March 2021- NCS released all four roommates from the lease due and my boyfriend and I decided to rent a two bedroom townhouse from them since there would be a different property manager and there were slim pickings for housing due to Covid. 
Since moving into the two bedroom, there have been handfuls of maintenance issues that simply aren’t worth diving into since the paragraphs above are explanation enough of how incompetent and horrific Nevada Commercial Services is. 


Nevada Commercial Services is downright the most incompetent rental company I have rented from. They do not answer your phone calls if you're having maintenance issues and it is impossible to get them to call you back in a timely manner. Maintenance either has to be called 4-5 times before actually coming out or we just have to keep submitting maintenance requests until someone contacts us. The biggest red flag I can tell you is that Vanessa Wood illegally threatened me and my boyfriend with “breach of agreement” unless we signed someone WE DIDNT EVEN KNOW onto our lease, which resulted in said person acting aggressively and erratic towards us.

Our hair started to fall off, and this water is very dangerous for health. Landlords don't care about the water because they are not bathing here! Hallways are filthy dirty and dusty! The cleaner can vacuum once a month. The parking is in critical condition, the ceiling is supported with metal poles, leaking 24/7. At any time the ceiling can come crashing down and nobody cares! After the fire in 2018 the repair was done only on top not inside. The cracks are coming through, the floor is inflating in some places, and when we came after the fire there was a stinch of chemicals and mold. The landlords are increasing their rent every year, but no service. Every time they are recalculating the rent for previous years! There is no peace and quiet with these buildings, tenants are screaming and yelling and having parties after 11pm, sometimes at 3am, and the security guards are lazy butts, only eating and sleeping on the job! Nothing will be done unless you personally come out onto the balcony and yell at them. Homeless people are coming to our building, taking everything they want on the parking lot, going into the laundry to wash clothes in the sink. The apartment's front doors are very loose and it's normal for the management , someone is looking through the mail box in the evening.

3516,TOM SCOTT,WINDSOR,ONTARIO,N9B 2T8,CA,"F/21 I was a tenant of his for about 6 months before breaking my lease due to domestic violence. This was a student rental accommodation shared with 3 other females. The basement was full of mold and the stairs were not up to code, so bad that my mother slipped off the bottom step and broke her foot. She did not sue as she did not want to cause issues with the landlord at the time. 

Tom was okay with housing a tenant who was $1300 behind on rent and figured the best way to remedy the situation was by refusing to come fix the single functioning toilet in the only bathroom we had. Our fridge went out as well days before the incident and he still refused to come and fix it until her missing rent was paid. 

The tenant who jumped me was the one behind on rent. I kept saying pay your rent to her until she snapped and lunged at me. I do think that tensions were running high in the house as our appliances and toilet were breaking down. It was added stress to us as young students in school. 

I called my parents to let them know I was breaking my lease as the cheques for payment were from their account. My father spoke to Tom about the situation and all he could keep rambling about was how I had an obligation to pay my lease. (I broke the lease legally as domestic violence is one of the top clauses for breaking a lease in Ontario) He kept repeating that he would be getting his $500 monthly no matter what. My father had to tell him that his disregard for the safety of all involved in the altercation was disgusting. He did not ask if everyone was okay, if anyone was injured etc. only cared about where his $500 was coming from. That was when my father started discussing the issues with the bathroom, fridge, with the basement and how my mother had broken her foot. All he could say was “oh I see. Because I won’t let her end her lease you’re going to pick at my house now”. My dad just simply stated that he didn’t appreciate how little this man cared about our health with all the mold and the fact that we had no running toilet for days at a time. 

I moved out within 2 days after the incident, 2 streets over under a different landlord. Tom continued for the next 4 months to attempt depositing my “owed” rent. He never once reached out to me formally to discuss what had happened and instead decided to try taking more money from me/my family. 

He only stopped when we had to put a block on the cheques through our bank and explain the situation to them with proof.

They do text tenants now for updates. Emails are practically not monitored whatsoever once you’re a tenant. 

They don’t really do apt inspections except for last year there were like 2-3 in the span of a month thanks to a nightmare staff member which was very stressful. They told us ahead of time that they’d be entering all apartments throughout an entire week from 9-5p which left little room to plan for our dog being on the property if we weren’t around, etc. Some of the staff they hire is great at communicating proactively, others only communicate as needed and are awfully rude at it. The worst part about this place is absolutely the leasing office and staff because whether or not they’re kind or not, they’re ALWAYS incompetent, belittling, or fucking up on something all the time, adding ridiculous charges to things constantly. They constantly would take packages claiming they were trying to keep them from being stolen, yet sometimes it would take DAYS for them to admit they had taken a package so it was like they were stolen anyways.

I would not move back here due to the pricing for what you get. If your apartment is street side, it is LOUD 24/7 with cars on McDowell so good luck… I constantly lived on edge due to this and your apartment is not soundproofed from the street literally at all, your walls will shake as well. Oddly enough, i only ever heard neighbors towards the end (fights and such, not so much regular noise) so at least you don’t have that noise on top of the street which is so bad you can’t even sit on your porch and have a normal conversation, or listen to music even on the loudest setting on your phone (without headphones) not exaggerating. It smells constantly of gasoline there too bc of how many cars pass daily, it’s really not ideal. 

The area isn’t really safe either anymore as we constantly had homeless people sleeping on our gated porch, car break ins in the gated garage part of the complex, and packages stolen. The office, when our neighbors/friends/we would tell them about these issues, did nothing (at least that the complex could tell) to solve these issues. Tenant pets range from sweet to holy shit how the hell do you allow that pet on the property, there’s a few dog parks but some people don’t clean up after themselves ever (it’s obvious who doesn’t once you’ve lived here a bit) and some people don’t step in if their pets are aggressive which isn’t great. Lots of tenants here are college kids (I think) because there would be parties constantly on the weekends. Not an issue for me but if you don’t like that then you wouldn’t be a fan of this place as people leave their doors open while they have guests over. 

Wouldn’t recommend if you’re a woman living alone (due to safety concerns), someone who’s disabled (there’s no elevators, ramp access is minimal throughout the complex), someone who enjoys peace and quiet, a couple (there’s very little storage available in unit but you can pay a monthly fee to rent a stupid storage closet), or someone who doesn’t want to overpay to live in essentially a noise amplifier with zero storage. 

If you’re a single guy, or someone who’s low maintenance noise wise, I think this place could work for you for sure if you have money to burn and couldn’t care less about if you’re getting what you pay for lol.",5,5,2,4,2

Rent: about average for the ridiculously inflated local market, but if you're a day late on rent you can expect to find a warning on your door the next morning.

Maintenance: a joke. I've submitted dozens of work orders in my years here for things such as broken appliances, water leaks, faulty wiring, and mold; of those, they have responded to one. Whenever I call to follow up, there is no record of my request on their side, even if I sent it via their online platform. I have outlets in my apartment that haven't worked in a year, one of the bathrooms in our unit hasn't worked in two because the toilet and sink both leak water, so they're both just shut off, and the air conditioner both distributes air poorly and only has one sensor, so one bedroom is always freezing and the rest of the apartment is at least five degrees above whatever we've set the thermostat to.

Groundskeeping: also a joke. There's broken glass in the lots that has been there since I moved in, trash regularly piles up in front of the disposal unit because of how frequently it breaks down. The water mains break frequently, and even for routine maintenance the complex almost always fails to give adequate warning to residents of the water shut-off.

3593,CORBY HORLINGS,GRAND RAPIDS,MICHIGAN,49305,US,"I rented under Corby Horlings with roommates for one year. It was our first rental, so we didn't know what red flags to look for or how to address them once we realized there were problems. The home was an illegally separated duplex that was later sold as a single family home. The heating/cooling in the upper unit was not connected to the lower upper unit and shared with the lower unit. The keys between the two units were also the same - we could have gotten into our downstairs neighbor's unit and they could get into ours. There was some kind of problem with the water that resulted in our water bills being ""excessive,"" resulting in us being charged an additional $150 each quarter. This was split between us and the downstairs neighbor, so whatever issue there was, it was $300 worth of water and it was never investigated for repair beyond texts from the landlord asking if there were leaking toilets. The basement where a shared washer/dryer was located was borderline hoarded by the downstairs neighbor. The one time a repair person was sent over, he seemed to be heavily under the influence of something. The house was also full of mice, which the downstairs neighbor was managing with indoor cats (it was a no pets rental) despite the landlord being aware of it. No mousetraps or other such pest control measures were ever in the house. We moved out because the increase in rent he asked was unreasonable based on the conditions of the rental, and a sizeable chunk of our security deposit was taken because of the previously mentioned water issue. I think he's mostly in the selling flipped houses business nowadays but I would not feel safe renting from this landlord again.",1,1,2,3,4

We then had the basement drain back up into the basement. The plumber told us it backed up to where it meets the sewage pipe so it could contain tonnes of bacteria. Because of this we lost 2 bedrooms and our rec room. Kids had to live in the living room for weeks.He refused a rent reduction and got mad at us when he realised we could still flush toilets. He said it wasn't an emergency if we could (which also meant he thought we had no toilets for two weeks)

We ended up moving because they didn't do any sanitizing and I couldn't rent from a man I didn't trust or respect. 

He also rented the neighbouring house to people who had the police there once a week. We had to call the police because one of them opened our front door and ran towards our teen daughter, saw us, opened the back door and jumped off of our patio. Harry refused to evict them.",1,1,2,5,2

However, when I moved out they are charging me close to $361 for 'carpet repair'. I cleaned and had help cleaning not only the carpet but the entire unit. The photo they sent me had no damage to the carpet whatsoever. Even in their lease it states ""Liable for the following charges, if applicable, unreimbursed service charges; repairs or damages caused by negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse"". There was no negligence, carelessness, accident or abuse to that carpet. In fact, we thoroughly cleaned it before I left. I even spoke with one of the apartment staff, and she could not find any soil damage from the photo they sent either. Instead she just said the apartment had a dog smell. Charging someone $361 for a smell is not only unreasonable, but it is irrelevant to the state to which the carpet was in, which was pristine. It's one thing if I left the apartment dirty, or if the carpet had stains on it. But I really tried to do the right thing and make their lives easier by cleaning the entire unit and making sure the carpet was clean. Them charging me this exorbitant cost is in incredibly bad faith. If you're reading this, I wouldn't rent here unless you like unreasonable charges for damages that are nonexistent",2,3,1,3,1

Never got repaired and didn’t respond to any messages. Our oven stopped working Nov 2022 and Every time it’s mentioned he ignores us. So haven’t had a working oven since then. William listed this apt as a 2 bedroom and honestly it’s more a 1 bedroom with a storage closet. The 2nd “bedroom” is the size of a small walk in closet. And to top it all off, our downstairs neighbors informed us they have a termite infestation and William has not done anything to fix it. When their heat went out, he nailed a space heater to their wall. Our water is randomly cut off, when the hot water tank went out he had the AUDACITY to ask us to pay for it.

3619,MARDA MANAGEMENT,WINDSOR,ONTARIO,N9A5S4,CA,"We rented with them in Windsor for a couple years and while everything started off solid, things went downhill the minute something broke and needed fixing. Getting repairs done, whether it was an electrical issue with appliances, a flooding drainage line in the basement from tree roots, a rat infestation in the yard, or various leaks in plumbing leading to damage to drywall and flooring, you could guarantee that it would take ages to address, the work would be the cheapest and shoddiest fix possible (screwing a window with a broken lock shut and writing ""window lock"" beside the screw in marker, putting caulking on a hole in a pipe instead of replacing the section, running extension cords to appliances to avoid fixing broken outlets), and the crews sent to do the work would only be getting paid to fix a single problem per call, even if it was multiple problems they theoretically could resolve.

At one point, after two years of paying the rent in full, promptly and on time, the rent increased (they max it every single year) and we hadn't adjusted our PAD form for the fifteen dollar increase, and they sent us an eviction notice instead of simply calling to resolve the error.

When we finally gave our notice that we were leaving, they listed the full address of our rental on Kijiji, so along with the multiple (four I think?) scheduled showings they set up (often with 2 or more prospective renters at the same time, and once sending 3 couples to our front porch and never actually showing up themselves at all), we also had daily randoms coming up and looking in our front windows, and when we complained about this, they brushed it off like it wasn't a problem.

3620,FENTON INVESTMENT CO,TUCSON,ARIZONA,85719,US,"I lived in a small house near the university that was built around 1930 and had shoddy electric and plumbing work. My bathroom sink tap broke once and was fixed by a plumber who said it was extremely old, had been inadequately repaired in the past, and was likely to break again. Months later I went out of town for over a month and came back to find that the tap had broken again and had been spewing hot water for at least 2 weeks. The entire bathroom was dripping with water and absolutely covered in mold. Since it was around 11pm I called my landlord’s emergency line several times but nobody picked up so I left voicemails. I had to vacate the house that night because of the mold. My landlord reached me the following day and told me a plumber and cleaner were coming. The plumber confirmed what the first one had said, that it was an outdated and poorly maintained sink and that it needed to be replaced rather than “fixed” again. He also advised that the amount of water damage and mold was severe enough to warrant tearing the bathroom down and rebuilding. The cleaner then came and said she had been told to remove only the surface mold then repaint the walls. No further repairs were made. He then insinuated that it was my fault and that I had “forgotten to turn the water off” before I left town. He also said I should have informed him before leaving even though that was not stipulated in my lease. I was due to move out shortly thereafter and he did not return my security deposit even though the rest of the house was in the same condition as when I moved in. He later sent me a huge bill for the water from the broken tap (even though water was included, as per my lease), repairs to the bathroom and some other frivolous things. I knew this was ridiculous so I ignored it and he never pushed the matter further since I believe he knew he was in the wrong as well. I preemptively spoke to a lawyer and he agreed that the repairs and damage were the landlord’s responsibility and not mine. By that time, I was living in another state and willing to cut my losses as long as the landlord did not pursue further action.

Later it became clear that she is totally unable to respect tenant privacy and has an unusual domineering streak. No need to go through the whole bizarre story, but she:
1. Repeatedly made pretenses to enter my apartment and demanded I justify to her why I owned a sewing machine and a thermometer. 
2. Made me sign an unusual list of rules. 
3. Accused me of running ""a small business"" which she claimed was not allowed (wasn't in the rules). I am a professional and at the time was working 12 hour shifts and was away for most weekends, so I don't know when she thought I had time to run this business out of my apartment. 
4. Sent me emails with confusing statements or demands and didn't reply to requests to elaborate. ""No electricity on the 3rd floor"", ""chemicals are not allowed"", ""COINS ARE COLLECTED WEEKLY FROM THE WASHER""
5. It became clear she was entering the apartment when I wasn't there and looking through my things. Nothing ever went missing, I think she's just nosy and has no concept of boundaries. 
6. Accused me of starting fires regularly. Not sure where this came from.
7. Was peering through my window (she was about 1 foot away) from my yard at 10pm. She ran when I turned off the lights and caught her watching me. Later when confronted she claimed she was ""inspecting the yard for storm damage"". In the dark, without a light, at 10pm, right outside my window. 

I informed her I would not be renewing the lease (didn't explain why). Before I moved out we did a whole apartment inspection and I asked her if there was anything that needed additional cleaning or repair. She said no. She tried to keep the entire security deposit because she wanted to renovate the apartment. After her repeated refusals to negotiate I filed in small claims court.

The buildings are quite old with no ventilation, so black mold continually accumulates on my floor under furniture due to the humidity build-up, and I cannot open a window to cool down because of the risk of rats/bugs entering through my window, which is at ground level.  (I have not yet asked about the issue or if I could be provided with a dehumidifier to ease the mold problems.) At the base of the window, several rat holes exist. Management makes clear attempts to eliminate pests such as roaches and rodents - they have been quite successful with roaches, but rodents in the walls making excessive noise continues to be an issue every now and then. Termites are seasonal. When I moved into the unit, there were several rodent holes I ended up patching myself (my first attempt at contacting maintenance was not successful, and I didn't want to have to wait even longer by making further attempts to contact, I wanted them gone, so I did it myself). Some of the buildings are nicer, but some of them are a ""you-get-what-you-pay-for"" type of situation - the low rent (under $500) and age of the buildings seem to come with these problems.

Privacy is respected. They seem to be making attempts at updating common areas such as laundry to appear more up-to-date, clean, and inviting, which is appreciated.

My overall evaluation would be a 3/5, adequate, I added an extra half point due to the age of the buildings, which presents some forgivable issues, but if the buildings were newer, that half point would not be there.

The rent is more affordable than other places, but a single income is not enough for them to accept you if you are one of the many many people of today's economy who make low income, especially if you are young as they much prefer older tenants. They have a very troublesome view of younger people and will not see you as a responsible person if you are under 25. If they do accept you at that age, they will keep a close eye on you for a while, but other than this they don't pay you much attention as long as you pay your rent on time.
They do accept pets under a certain weight, though your lease states they are not allowed. I advise you to keep confirmation of pets in writing if ever they decide to kick you out for it.
Repairs are okay. Anything deemed the fault of the building they will fix, more or less. My apartment had visible water damage in the ceiling even after they said they would fix it. Infestations, clogged drains and other such issues are deemed your responsibility to pay for.
Personal washing machines, grills and bird-feeders are not permitted however I've heard they will turn a blind eye if you're a good tenant as id noticed many grills on my neighbors balconies.

I spoke with multiple other tenants who were given the same or higher rate increase.   I was told that the rep would contact me again before the weekend  once they spoke with their bosses about my dissatisfactions to see if they would lessen the unreasonable hike or keep my current rate.  They have not.  I am now forced to send them a letter of notice to vacate at the end of my lease by Monday but don't know if they are going to meet my request.   Im deeply disappointed.

3698,EDGE APARTMENTS AT LAFAYETTE,LAFAYETTE,LOUISIANA,70506,US,"I have many issues with this place, but I’ll list them put in bullet points for simplicity’s sake. 

- In the lease and in advertising they boast safe, drug-free apartments. This is just not true. They knowingly allow drug dealers to live and “do business” on the property. 
- They know there’s a black mold infestation on the property but do nothing about it and claim it’s just dust or mildew.
- They know there’s a roach infestation on property and do nothing about it. 
- Multiple break in attempts.
- Theft.
- There are peaceful outdoor cats on property and a few resident’s cats, none do any harm to anyone or anything, and a tenant decided to shoot and kill a tenant’s pet and a stray! Management did nothing to address it. 
- I recently learned through the google reviews of the property that they covered up a MURDER that happened on property several years ago. 
- They do not respect a tenant’s right to privacy and will do monthly inspections while calling them “annual” and “quarterly” inspections. They never give a set date and time on when they will enter, making it impossible to be present for them. Instead you are sent an email and told, for example, that they will enter any time between April 1st and April 30th between the hours 9 am - 5 pm, mon-fri. Given they do inspections monthly, there is never at time where I can be at peace. 
- Despite telling management that another tenant ASSAULTED ME!! They did nothing about it and essentially told me “tough-shit”.
- Predatory bait and switch practices and attempts to alter lease without tenant’s consent or knowledge.

3708,MARTIN AND CO DERBY,DERBY,ENGLAND,DE1 1RF,GB,"Martin and co have to be the most frustrating letting agents for repairs.

I've reported very simple jobs that have never been fixed. The excuse given when I've asked why work has not been carried out is that there's so many jobs they have to complete, that they can't get to everyone right away. I've had to make my own repairs where possible. To give an idea, it's been a year since I reported the first issue I've had (I won't specify what it is I I'd like to remain anonymous) and to this day, it's not been sorted. I even gave a 1 star Google review as a an issue had become urgent, but couldn't get in contact on the emergency number, only to get a very rude call from a manager asking why I left a poor review. If only they were so committed to keeping contact on existing issues!

And don't bother taking the time to clean when you leave a Martin and Co property. They will deduct cleaning costs regardless of if you have cleaned the property yourself. That's £45 I won't see again from my deposit. I even took photos of the property I left and that wasn't good enough, they still apparently sent cleaners in, despite my best efforts to leave the place spotless.

I've given a 5/5 for other areas, I've never had a landlord burst into my property unannounced, rent has stayed the same.

As for health and safety, the front door to the building doesn't use a latch on the inside, so if there's a fire you HAVE to have a key to escape and it's the only exit out. 

Overall, if you see Martin and co and want to rent a property, be ready for issues to take months to be sorted, make sure you properly inspect the property when you view it.",1,3,5,5,5

We are not friends with this person and are amicable at best, this felt like a breach in boundaries. They've had roaches infest the building without proper insect management, just small black repellent/trap things left in divots around the units and building common areas. Landlord also asked us to keep an ear out for the downstairs neighbor under our unit after we called a wellness check on said lessor in unit 2 who had fire rescue teams come out. They were fine but ambulances are called at least monthly for the tenant below us. We had to have spectrum run cables for our internet/cable since our landlord refused to find them and told us to not run them through the vents since it was a less than impressive job doing so, which we adhered to, but then our decided upon resolve resulting in a 20 minute phone call verbally assaulting our choice of how the cables were run and telling us that we were to fault since he refused to help in the first place.

Our property manager did not have a record of us moving out and they haven't set anything in motion on their end. On top of that, their move out checklist is utterly unreasonable.

3714,FPI,DAVIS,CALIFORNIA,95618,US,"Where to start. The complex I'm at was a great place to live until it was bought out by FPI. Our rent immediately jumped the legal maximum and we were given a lease full of clauses like waiving our right to sue if someone is hurt from unmaintained communal resources, waiving our right to have our image used for promotional material, and banning everything you could use to personalize your patio (lights, flags, chimes, non-patio furniture, certain plant pots, etc.) They even tried to slide in a clause that violated a local ordinance. There was a undated addendum to allow for construction, which has been nonstop outside of weekends. Unending construction noise and debris. Nothing on the lease was up for negotiation and they left us only a weeks notice to sign before our lease expired. 

They are doing the most to push out current residents so they can turn a profit. They said they needed to conduct inspection of fire alarms and instead noted any lease violations. They e managed to get a lot of people to leave, and it's never been this empty before.

In terms of safety, the storms knocked a tree down which crushed a roof and tipped over a parking lot light. The building got fixed up quickly, but the light stayed on the ground for several weeks. Which made it essentially useless and the lot very dark. They also insisted on continuing to replace outter walls for ""water damage"" during the storms. They pulled down the dry wall and left it open during weeks of rain. 

The only good points here are the property manager, who they kept from the last owners. She's amazing and does whatever she can to help ASAP. She even gives out her personal cell in case of emergency. She's not a fan of how FPI is running things either. 

It's miserable to live here and I can't wait to leave.",4,3,2,2,2
3715,MORGUARD NAR CANADA LP,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4H1J3,CA,"Trying to be vague in this review for fear of retribution.  I have lived in my apartment for over a decade so I pay substantially well below current market value thanks to rent control.   For this reason it is nearly impossible to get them to do repairs.  One of the contractors told me when they finally did come to do the repair that they were told by management to only fix the worst part and not replace another part that also should have been replaced years ago.

Some of the repairs they do are done so badly that on several occasions I have to re-do the work after they leave.

Pest control for the building is done by a big name company but they must have a deal with them to do the least work possible so on paper they appear to comply with the landlord tenant act.   I have caught them faking a bug treatment and when I brought it upstairs to management they shrugged their shoulders and said ""yes, we have had reports like this before"".

The building super uses the fire department intercom to make general announcements such as contractor cars parked in wrong spots.   This intercom blasts in every apartment at 200 decibels.   To make matters worse the building super repeats everything twice like the fire department does as if it is really an important thing.

I have a stack of notice of entry papers where they don't even bother to show up.   I like to be home when they enter the apartment so this is extremely annoying when they are a no show.   I have seen them enter my apartment the next day after they missed the day given (they knocked on the door but I sat silently just to see what they would do).   In my opinion this is a form of break and entering.  The super at the time who opened the door for them just blamed the lack of paperwork on the contractors!",1,2,3,2,4

There was also a mouse problem. Other than that, my biggest issue was this landlord’s communication. When I told him I couldn’t afford his apartment a month into the pandemic, he was very rude and said “don’t expect to get 24 hours’ notice” for showings. He conducted in person showings despite public health officials’ recommendations, which I had flagged for him, and despite the fact that many if not most other landlords were doing virtual showings at that time. I offered to film a complete walkthrough for prospective tenants, but he said my choice was to either deal with strangers walking through my house or pay him the $1500 he was concerned about losing. He had three weeks to find new tenants by the way.

If you do everything exactly as this man wants, you will likely have few issues, but know he is quick to anger and will become oppositional if challenged.

3727,MEHRI FALLAH & PEGAH OGHABI,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4W1M4,CA,"I want to stick to the facts so that nobody ever rents from this mother daughter duo. 
We lived at 825 Church for almost 4 years when we were handed an N12. Not for a minute did we believe they were being honest but we didn’t want to fight. Instead, we kept an eye on the unit in the event that they were in fact lying. During our tenancy, they regularly showed us that they had very little understanding of their responsibilities as a landlord. They tried to charge us “the first $50 of any repair” when the track lighting needed to be fixed, they included a no dog clause in one of the schedules attached to the lease, they tried to withhold the one months rent owing to us as part of the N12 for potential repairs, attempted to have us pay for our last month rent accusing us of not paying for one of the months during our tenancy, and tried to avoid paying us interest on our last months rent claiming “they’d never paid any other tenant any interest”. Thankfully, we were well versed on our rights as tenants and didn’t get swindled by them. The condo was a brand new building. We complete the initial inspection on move in and marked up the walls for them to have them repaired. We dealt directly with the condo when our track lighting broke and took great care of the unit. Every single rent cheque was cashed and paid on time. We were model tenants. 

Turns out that they were lying when they gave us the N12. They ended up signing a 3 year lease with a luxury rental company and got an extra $500/month in rent from them. Thanks to our detective skills, we compiled evidence to prove they gave us the N12 in bad faith and sued them at the LTB and won. They had to pay all our moving expenses and the difference in rent for a full year, nearly $10k. I would have been happy with $0 if it meant they would never be landlords again.

We then had to leave the unit again for hours while the workers we were cleaning up. Evan hadn’t told them of our plans because he hadn’t asked and assumed our timeline.

This includes; removing amenities, attempting to make us pay more than the lease agreement for air conditioning in lump sum ahead of time (including tenants who do not have AC as a separate charge). If we don't agree to pay they have said they will remove the AC unit at cost of the tenant.
I don't see why anyone would agree to pay for months they aren't using the AC for, let alone for a rate above the agreed upon amount.

Landlords should only be entering once a year for checking fire alarms/smoke detectors, and then only coming in if I request repairs, not to constantly fiddle with the water tank and the hydro meter and the windows.  Also, they just put window limiters up, so since we don't have AC, we will probably succumb to heat stroke come summer.  They claim it's a safety issue.  But when I complained that rainwater is pouring in through the exhaust vent above my ELECTRIC stove and soaking it and my kitchen floor whenever it rains, they refuse to do anything to fix it because ""it would cost too much to rent a crane to go up the side of the building to cover the vent.""

3769,FINLEY PROPERTIES,COLUMBUS,OHIO,43221,US,"Finley Properties took over our townhouse after a massive repair left the previous company unable to hold onto the property. While the Dublin townhouses (in Hilliard) give you 2 beds and 2.5 bathrooms for a very affordable rate, that's where the good ends.
1. Finley Properties is clearly more interested in having as much property as possible to extract profit from, and not having enough maintenance to actually keep them livable. Multiple times, we had to call more than 3 times to get anyone out to address serious issues (the AC leaking water into our utility closet for a month which was half an inch deep, mice, fly infestations that filled the unit with hundreds of the things in a month EVERY SUMMER and even an entire RAT living in our walls and eating our food). Each time, it took several calls just to get someone out to look at the problem, and often they just never sent someone to follow up and fix it.
2. The landlord, Shelley Finley, is near impossible to reach by phone (and her message box was full the entire time we lived in the unit), often files names to utility companies with incorrect spelling, and will often try to get you to accept returned deposits through PayPal or Zelle, despite the fact that she once even lost an entire rent check of ours via Zelle despite me showing her several times that it had been sent to her correctly.
3. Shelley also is well-known for losing or forgetting correspondence, particularly where vacating a unit is concerned. We gave her notice multiple times we were leaving our unit and month-to-month lease, and each time we had to remind her of our names and unit number. After we vacated, she was still unaware we had left until we called her and told her we had left the keys to the unit.
4. Shelley also shows potentially sexist views of her tenants. Despite my wife and I being equal partners and leaseholders under the former landlord, my wife had to fight multiple times to get Shelley to acknowledge her as a co-lessee, and even then would only ever speak to me or acknowledge that the unit was in my name during contact, as if my wife was not important in the matter.
6. Finally, Shelley raised our rent $100 in the second year after our previous landlords vacated. She was unable to provide any justification for this rise in rent when asked.

3774,CLOVERLEAF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,SAN ANTONIO,TEXAS,78239,US,"The issues we have had here have been absolutely ridiculous. It's not just a list, it's a freaking novel at this point. Every single major appliance in our unit has had to be replaced multiple times. They always replace it with a used appliance, which I wouldn't mind if they worked, but they inevitably develop the exact same issues as the item they replaced. We always have to submit multiple repair requests to get anything actually addressed. After ongoing issues with our A/C - which, naturally, was replaced more than once - we finally hired someone on our own dime who identified the ACTUAL problem, and even then we had to repeatedly request that the needed repairs be made. The guys they sent out kept telling us our system just needed to be ""topped off"" with freon - except that an A/C is a closed system and would only need topping off if there was a leak. Which there was - multiple leaks. The company we hired told us all of the ductwork and insulation needed to be replaced. Take a wild guess whether property management actually did that after getting their report. We had a possum infestation and one died in the walls. The exterminators they sent told us they couldn't get to it because our neighbors were out of town, so for some reason that meant we had to spend WEEKS smelling decomposing possum. Guests literally left because of the stench. Whether it's the landlords or the management company, someone absolutely refuses to make improvements to this property. These places are horribly insulated and so they're impossible to keep at a comfortable temperature and our electric bill during the summer is insane. They won't even put screens on the windows to help us keep the bugs out when the weather is nice enough to open the place up and spare us some of the cost of cooling the place. Our back porch had to be replaced because a support beam was completely rotted through (which they FINALLY realized after we complained about loose boards multiple times) and they had the gall to tell us they had no liability if one of us got injured due to their failure to properly maintain the property because ""they told us about it."" No, WE told YOU, and that doesn't actually absolve you of liability, but nice try. The replacement porch was significantly smaller and doesn't even have a rail - and this after the construction guys they sent out showed us a picture of what we were supposedly getting, which was a painted porch with a rail that was comparable in size to the previous one. They left a crack in our ceiling (caused by a water leak) for weeks on end, despite multiple requests to fix it, until I finally got fed up and sent an exasperated email. Then they refused to test for mold, despite the fact they'd let the repair go for as long as they did. There are cracked tiles, cracked windows, loose electrical outlets, all of which have been brough to their attention with nothing done. We're currently experiencing issues with the THIRD dishwasher they've installed in our place, and the repair guy again recommended a replacement, and naturally we haven't heard back about it. They routinely send out repairmen who clearly aren't qualified (one guy was literally looking up YouTube videos of how to repair the dishwasher) and who don't know what the issues are, which means we have to re-explain everything every time one of them shows up. We've also had repairment - like the ones who replaced the porch - leave tons of trash all over our yard. They don't clean up after themselves at all - we had tacks and nails all over the yard after the porch replacement. Super safe, guys, thanks. And every single year, like clockwork, they raise the rent. Water was included in the rent when we first moved in; they changed that a year in.

She started throwing accusations including things like keeping the front sunroom too messy (this was a shared space, and most of the mess was old supplies she had left there), and paying rent late when the rent had been paid on time via EMT, she just didn't deposit it on time. :S  In a fury one day she discarded everything out of the sunroom including a pair of boots and several coats of mine. When we finally ended up at the LTB for an eviction hearing for late rent, she admitted in mediation that she wanted me out and late rent just seemed like the easiest way to achieve it. The eviction would have been dismissed but I settled for a cash payment and got out of that.  I would highly recommend staying away from this landlord.",2,4,1,1,1

Got an email two months after I moved out that the work order I placed stating the range hood drips when it rains, worse when it snows, had been fulfilled. It had been like that for two winters. I didn't have a bathroom fan for the last ten months I lived there because the fan blew out--there was a spark, a pop, and the cover fell out of the ceiling. I called the property manager immediately to tell her and submitted a work order right after. I don't know if it's been fixed. Someone stole my bike, my umbrella, and the seat from the bike that I bought to replace the stolen one. One June, I had an issue with the app I used to pay rent. It locked me out. I contacted the apartment manager (via three different methods) as well as reporting through the app to try to get it resolved. I got no reply. I tried throughout the month, but eventually gave up, hoping it'd reset the next month and I'd just hafta pay a fine along with two months' rent. Nope. Got an email mid July reminding me to pay. I replied, explaining the situation again. Got a response back that I should use another payment method. I reiterated that this method was my only option (long story). She reiterated that I should use another method. She refused to understand me. Beginning of august, I get a ten-day notice (pay past due or we'll terminate). Mid August, I get a 24-hour entry notice for maintenance. Apartment manager personally comes in for a yearly inspection, sees that my apartment is impeccably clean and half empty, with boxes everywhere, and asks if there are any issues with the plumbing. There is. She and another walk around inspecting the building. She asks me to fill out a work order for the faucet, thanks me, and leaves. They made no contact with me until the night before my eviction--when she texted me to remind me to get out--in February. They kept leaving eviction notices with decreasing amounts to pay to stay but not following through and not responding to my calls, texts, and emails to both the apartment manager and the address for the property management company. They were likely following the law of evictions, but I don't know what those are. Since I was getting evicted, I shifted my focus to my mental health (I've just learned I'm autistic after my son's diagnosis instead of my finances. My son and I lived for nine months thinking we were about to get kicked out with nowhere to go. It was impossible to plan/pack for.

3805,ZAHED PROPERTY MANAGEMENT (TILA TROCHEZ),LEXINGTON,KENTUCKY,40509,US,"Zahed Property Management bought out our building during the last 6 months of our lease. Prior to that, we had regular correspondence with our property manager about maintenance, pest control once a month, and generally a decent experience. Once Zahed Property Management bought our building, all correspondence stopped after the initial letter pinned on everyone’s door. Our maintenance requests went unanswered, tenants started moving out left and right, and our neighbor was delivered an eviction notice the first week of the month because they alleged he had not paid that month’s rent. Turns out they’d lost his payment and only after a week of squabbling with them did they manage to find it and rescind the eviction.

Many of the people who moved out would leave their full bins on the curb several days in advance and there was no on-site maintenance staff to collect the bins after these people had moved. This resulted in the property managers getting a fine from the city. The property managers then proceeded to send everyone letters saying we’d all committed lease violations for not taking our trash cans to and from the curb in proper time and that everyone was to be subject to an interior inspection of their home. A lot of us left voicemails at the office complaining that we’d dealt with our own cans and weren’t responsible for the trash of moved out tenants. No one got any response and we were all still subjected to interior inspections. 

At the time of late 2022, this management company has had 7 state fines against them in Kentucky for neglecting mandatory  maintenance on their properties. Luckily we’d already planned on moving out early 2023. We gave 60 days notice of our move and a request for a move out inspection date through email, as well as sending the last month’s rent 30 days in advance along with a written letter of intent to move. Phone calls were not answered or returned. We did not hear anything back until about 20 days before we were set to move out, which was just a one sentence email acknowledging our move. No scheduling of a move out date, no move out inspection checklist, just the business version of an “ok.” text.

4 days later, about two weeks before we were to move out, at 8 PM a man came by and unlocked the door and walked into our bedroom. He asked why we were still there and said our apartment was supposed to be empty. We told him that we emailed and physically mailed our move out date to Tila Trochez. He claimed that he was just told by Tila Trochez to come show the apartment to a prospective tenant and asked if we’d even paid the last month of rent. I had to show him the emails we’d sent to her and he left. I’m assuming after that she blocked my email address and phone number because I have not been able to get a hold of anyone with Zahed Property since. My roommate had to email her constantly and leave voicemails everyday before we could get a move out inspection date (we had to be physically present for the inspection and we were set to move out of state, so it was pretty pressing that we settled on a date we were still in Kentucky). 

After moving, we have yet to hear anything from the property managers. In Kentucky, landlords are required to provide a list of damages and charges to explain the reasons any portion of a security deposit is retained, or the deposit must be returned to the tenants within the first 30-60 days after moving. We haven’t received any correspondence of any kind from them despite both of us leaving several voice mails and emails stating our intent to collect our security deposit. It has now been over three months since we moved and we’re in the process of pursuing legal action in small claims court to get our security deposit returned.",1,1,1,1,1

3816,COUNTRY AIR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,LAKEPORT,CALIFORNIA,95453,US,"This company owns many properties in this county and I have only experienced one; a small two bedroom apartment in a building of about 10 units. I looked at a different property of theirs first. This place was small and located in a very weird place, but I turned it down because of the carpet installed in the kitchen and bathroom. I know that's not as big a deal to some people, but I do not like to have carpet in areas where spills are likely to occur. That's just begging for mold. I even asked if there was a chance it could be replaced but they were firm that the carpet would stay. It felt like a setup to keep my deposit.

The place I settled on was functional. That is to say, it had no problems that made living there impossible. But whatever contractor they hired to fix the place up was either inexperienced or in a big rush. Not a single cabinet door in the entire apartment was plumb. The bathroom sink had a leak coming from out of the wall. Sometimes water doesn't come out of the shower head when it's turned on. Every set of window blinds was dirty and missing slats. The main bedroom had no blinds or curtains, just a super thin, super cheap curtain rod. One of the closets had both doors halfway off the track. And talk about bugs! Granted, the place is only several yards from a lake but I found used ant traps when I moved in during the winter so I know they are aware that this building has an huge ant problem. There is a laundry room on site but it is permanently closed ""due to high costs"". And repairs are contracted out to third parties, so how quickly any issue gets addressed is apparently out of their hands.

In summary, the place is perfectly livable. But the management company does the absolute bare minimum and might even set people up to lose their deposits. We will see when I move out. I would highly recommend looking for a private landlord if you're looking for a place in this area. But, if you can't find anything else, you'll be okay here.",2,2,3,4,3
3817,ED CONSTABLE,LINDEN,MICHIGAN,48451,US,"Came home St. Patrick's Day night, from a bike ride with my husband and toddler to find a strange man in our yard with a flashlight, metal detector and shovel. The man said he was friends with ""Eddy"" and had permission to search our yard and driveway (a home split with a business tenant below us), for things to keep. I was missing a heavy 14k gold heirloom necklace at the time, which we never found. I'm not saying that he found it, but it is possible. I'm not saying he was drunk, but I can't conform that he wasn't. I spent the next few hours looking out different windows to see if he was still around, debating on calling the police. I finally reached Ed Constable the following day, and he brushed off my concerns saying this was perfectly okay because his friend did have his permission to search our yard for keepsakes.

At that time, our front door swung open due to unaddressed repair issues. This particular issue took months to resolve (8 months in total, if memory serves me correctly). I eventually noticed that the issue was resolved, but we were not given notice before or after the repairs were made. Suffice to say that we weren't home at the time, or else we would have probably heard the power tools inside the apartment.

At the time we signed our lease, Ed sat down with us and asked us to please cover any nail holes in the walls with some drywall. This was not written in the lease, but rather a verbal agreement. The written lease did say that we were not to paint. When we moved out of the apartment, multiple people spent days getting the place into order for the return of our deductible. We were mailed a written repair estimate from Ed, which among other things, accused us of causing $2,000 in damages because we patched the drywall and he needed to hire someone to paint over it.

They were polite, friendly, helpful, and just seemed like the kind of folks who would never present any issue. I would be renting in a house, starting with one upstairs roommate and two more empty bedrooms on my floor, that might get filled. I was fine with that. I moved in around March 1st 2016. There were a few growing pains, but nothing I considered out of the ordinary for a new rental (we were his first tenants) and new tenant/LL relationship.

That all changed the morning of 13 April, I woke up to strange noises coming from downstairs. I went down to the kitchen and found the noises were coming from the unfinished basement. I feared someone had broken into the house. I found it was actually construction contractors. Vince had decided to do work on the basement without letting me or my roommate know (24 hours' notice required). He also had not told the *contractors* that he hadn't told us they were coming, and for their part the workers actually supported our shocked and angry response. They were also hugely embarrassed by what happened and on Vince and Angelina's behalf. This also meant we could not use the laundry facilities, which were part of our lease. We were told the work would take ""10 days"". By May 31st, it had been 49 days and the work was still ongoing. Construction was to take place weekdays, Monday to Friday between 8am and 4:30pm. It also took place outside these hours, and Vince would show up unannounced on weekends with construction workers in tow. Initially the work specified was to ""underpin the existing rubble foundation"" and ""install weeping tile"". Past a certain point our relationship and communication deteriorated and he would not explain what other work he was doing. I noted at one point that the wall insulation was touching the hot water tank on two sides and the furnace on one side. The construction was so loud, we couldn't sleep or were woken up. My girlfriend stopped visiting due to the noise level, and my roommate and I both stopped having friends visit.

He did not provide us with a garbage can until evening 29 May / morning 30 May. So between March and June, he blamed his tenants for ""not taking out the garbage"" when in fact the city workers would refuse to collect the garbage from the curbside unless it was in a garbage can. No green bin (composting) was ever provided that I recall. Also when I first moved in, the blue bins (recycling) were filthy and full of assorted pieces of wood; this had to be dumped out and stored (lest the landlord accuse us of destroying or dumping his property), and then the bins had to be cleaned.

There were no carbon monoxide detectors present (as required by law) when we moved in, these did not appear until 24 March. When they did appear, they were the plug-in kind. CO detectors for tenant units are supposed to be hardwired into the electrical grid with battery back-ups. There were smoke detectors installed before we moved in, but the batteries were dead. I bought batteries myself and was never compensated. There also was no smoke detector on the upstairs roommate's floor, and to my knowledge one was never installed. No smoke detector or CO detector in the basement; not sure if they were installed after it was finished. No CO detector on the ground floor. Also when detectors were finally ""provided"" he left them on the kitchen counter still in their packaging, we had to install them ourselves. 

On 20 April I asked Vince for his email address; I never received it. I don't think there's a legal obligation for him to provide it, but I was trying to facilitate communication and thought it was a reasonable request. I also asked for a phone number and email for Angelina. Eventually got an email, but no phone number, and she said she only checked the email ""every couple days"". God forbid something important come up.

When we saw him in person and we made comments, complaints, asked questions, raised concerns etc., he never wrote any of it down.

The refrigerator had a built-in water dispenser which leaked, causing water to seep out from under the bottom of the fridge. This was never addressed.

We conflicted over access to, privacy in, and responsibility for common spaces. Vince's view was that we were renting our bedrooms (or in the upstairs roommate's case, the entire attic suite), and that the common spaces were not ""ours"". Yet if the common spaces were not ""ours"", he would not take responsibility as though they were ""his"", refusing to provide such items as a broom, mop, vacuum, dustpan, or dustbuster for months. The rented space being ""limited to a bedroom only"" was not mentioned on the tenancy agreement, I never agreed to it verbally, nor was it discussed when I viewed the home, or when I came to sign the lease. 

Various HVAC vents were stuck throughout the home, and the furnace/AC was inoperable for several days, in 30+ degree Celsius heat. I later found out that he had been lying about it being broken, when in fact he had turned it off intentionally using a switch on the wall. It actually worked fine, he just didn't want to pay the bill which he was responsible for. He also tried to tell us what we could and could not set the temperature at.

The place was advertised as ""furnished"" and, as I mentioned, Vince said he ""owned"" the common spaces, yet he did not provide a tablecloth, coasters, placemats, or curtains. Not that I required the tablecloth and stuff, but I also didn't want to damage his furniture. The furniture feet had no felt on them, so we had to be careful not to damage the floors. No iron or ironing board, no oven mitts, no microwave, no toaster, no shoe rack, no bath mat, no stoppers/plugs for the tub and bathroom sink. Upstairs roommate bought a toaster and microwave herself, and (rightly) took them with her when she left. She attributed her departure to, among other factors, gender-based harassment and other harassment she faced from Vince.

No coat rack; I had a coat rack that my mom had gotten me, but not a screwdriver or screws, and anyway at this point I was leery of ""damaging"" VInce's walls in case he got angry about it.

""Inspections"" and entry without notice; he would repeatedly show the empty rooms on 3 hours' notice, repeatedly enter the basement without any notice at all. The basement had a separate side exterior entrance, which had a lock. Then from there you could go down a set of stairs into the basement or up a set of stairs through a door into the part of the house where we lived. This door between the basement and upstairs did not have a lock on it -- meaning that despite the basement eventually being a fully finished suite with its own kitchen and bathroom, the downstairs roommate would have full access to the rest of the house, despite Vince saying otherwise.

The stove was a gas stove and we never received any confirmation that it was safe or approved for use. Not a fan of gas stoves in general as I came home at one point in the early hours of the morning and someone had left the gas on with the stove off. (It was not the upstairs roommate as she had had enough and moved out at this point, but several others had moved in.) I can't blame Vince for someone else leaving the gas on, but as I said, we never received word that it was okay to use in the first place. Anyway I vented the home and nobody died, yay.

About developing the basement, he told us to our faces that he ""didn't know what he wanted to do with it"", then I overheard him talking outside to someone about showing her the basement and renting it out, so he lied to us about that.

After a certain point when he kept coming into the house without any notice, I literally called the cops. The cops claimed it was a civil matter and not something they could intervene with. But they did point out that it looked nothing like a ""rooming house"" as he claimed.

Then he brought up renoviction and relativiction, gobbing off about how he could kick any of us out at any time if he decided he wanted to work on our rooms/spaces or have his daughter live in the house while she was in college, or have his dad move into the house for whatever reason. Just absolutely gross harassment and nonsense. We got a threatening letter from his fancy lawyer up in Toronto. I called the lawyer back and the lawyer never returned my call, probably because he knew they didn't have a legal leg to stand on. I was frankly surprised the lawyer agreed to write the letter in the first place given he must have known how much trouble it could get them all into. 

Vince demanded post-dated cheques for rent (which I had not realized are actually illegal in Ontario), yet he would not provide proper rent receipts. He repeatedly and proudly referred to the building as a ""half-a-million-dollar house"", but clearly hadn't bothered with inspecting it and acted like anything we asked him to do that could possibly cost him any money at all was financially impossible or extremely difficult (such as issuing proper rent receipts - like, are you trying to tell us you can afford multiple houses but can't afford a printer and a few sheets of paper?). The receipts didn't even have his name on them.

It was clear they hadn't bothered with inspecting the house, because every little detail we brought up - and even the big, blatant, obvious things that nobody could fail to miss walking by - to do with the house, they acted like it was a complete and total surprise and shock to them. I can't blame them for the way the house was before they bought it, but it was their job to inspect it and make sure it was up to snuff before putting it on the rental market and letting us move in. Like the smoke detector batteries, that cost me $20. I asked them, would they want another landlord to treat their daughter like this? Or Vince's dad?

The dryer squeaked. The dryer, that was in the basement, squeaked so loudly you could hear it in the attic loft, with all the intervening doors closed. Oh, and the dryer also ran on gas, and squeaking to me always implied metal on metal, which implied the possibility of sparks, which did not seem to me like a good thing with a gas dryer. 

I offered to mend the relationship, but they weren't interested, asking me to move out instead. On the previous occasion where police attended (after I called them), the officers noted to me that none of the rooms were individually numbered; there were no separate mailboxes; two of the bedrooms shared a vent; etc., i.e. there was no reasonable way to construe the accommodation on reflection as anything resembling a ""rooming house"" as Vince and his wife tried to claim it was. 

In general, Vince seemed to make a habit of agreeing to things and then forgetting or disregarding them. I told them I was going to start recording any conversations we had in person. 

Oh, also one of the post-dated cheques bounced and they tried to make an issue over the NSF fee ($75), but dropped it when I said I'd learned that stipulating post-dated cheques was illegal, and that they violated the law and my rights by not providing information about the Landlord and Tenant Board, and our respective rights and responsibilities, when I moved in -- despite knowing that I was a new resident to Ontario. If they'd provided that information, that would have prevented any question of an NSF fee. 

By the end of it, Vince stopped talking to me entirely and I was dealing with Angelina. She denied receiving post-dated cheques (like we didn't have an entire text message convo between me and Vince talking about it), and characterized my emails as ""threats"". (If it's threatening to know and discuss your legal rights, call me a threatener, I guess.) I had to spend fifty bucks to buy new cheques from the bank, too.",1,1,1,1,1
3831,RANDY CRUMP,GRAND RAPIDS,MICHIGAN,49503,US,Was a homeless disabled veteran and thought I won the jackpot with my 'Lil apartment on the 2nd floor in a 4 plex. I was able to start to get back on my feet in the apartment when my health declined because of a brain tumor and I needed another surgery on my ankle. I was up for my 5 year HUD-VASH renewal when I was scheduled for my pre-surgeory physical. He called my friend and fellow Trans-Veteran multiple slurs setting off their PTSD. I spoke to him a few days later and explaining that I am sick I am having surgery and I NEED someone with me because my SURGEON told me id basically be on FULL bedrest and he dismissed me and my needs. I did not see or talk to him EVER after that day. And because had he responded to my lawyers request to refile my illegal eviction with HIM upon a JUDGES order I'd still like to know why the woman who moved in downstairs during my surgery recovery gave me back my iPhone.

The property management company knew the 1st floor tenant was allowing feral cats to come in the building to ""get rid of the rats"" and did nothing to stop it. The cats peed and pooped in the house and it was never cleaned up. It smelled absolutely disgusting. The ceiling in one of the bedrooms leaked repeatedly. They allowed dangerous people to move in on the 3rd floor and allowed them to harass us until they were evicted. Half of our electrity was out for over a week, and the heat didn't work for several days in freezing conditions.

There is also currently lots of construction taking place across the complex. The construction doesn’t typically cause issues, but it is not super aesthetically appealing. They also seem to be adopting more “services” for the complex that are tacked onto tenant rent.

The fact that I was being allowed to live month-to-month without being ever asked to commit a specific number of months or ever changing the rent really blows my mind. I had to leave only because my significant other ""needed a change of scenery"" which makes sense because living down the street from Jerry World was, I argue, the single most obnoxious characteristic of that neighborhood. When repairs became necessary, the managers were occasionally successful in hiring someone to do the work. Usually, and for the most intense repairs, I simply was forced to carry out the repairs myself. Hope the place is still up to code.. but the garbage disposal is twice as powerful as the one I replaced so go nuts.

Bob ""hired"" the tenant in unit 6 to manage this property. These units were all advertised as ""executive townhouse for families"".Within the first week it became very apparent that unit 1 was rented by 4 people in their late teens/early 20's. 2 of the four were a couple that argued and threw objects while fighting at the shared wall. The bedroom wall was shared with our 5 year old son. From Thursday to Sunday they had non stop parties with the stereo cranked until 4 or 5am, and police regularly called not just from the noise, but their guests were parking in other people's driveways, passing out on lawns and even a few times on patio furniture they removed from other peoples yards. The police were already fed up before we moved here and had stopped responding and referred everyone renting to landlord tenant board, and other property owners to the city or lawyers.
The tenants in unit 3 (we met at the school, our son and their daughter started jk together) and we walked them to school together almost daily, after the first week or two they let us know the previous 2 tenants in our unit complained about the tenants in unit one and were forced to break the one year lease and move in less then 6 months because Bob refused to do anything other then refer everyone to speak to the manager in unit 6. Unit 3 had regularly complained as well since they could hear the music and banging from unit 1, it was quite literally so loud in unit 2 that they heard it clearly in unit 3. When unit 2 sat empty the manager said it was loud to unit 3 because it was echoing in the empty unit.
By the end of the third week we were regulary packing up our 5 year old and 7 month old and slept in the basement Thursday to Sunday with ear plugs in and a mobile running non stop to try and drown out some of the sounds from next door.
Bob asked us to mediate with unit 1 and the manager. Manager said for us to go and knock when they were being ""too loud for the babies"" and ask them to keep it down. The way she said it I'm confident she meant us and not the children. Thursday rolls around and I gave it until midnight to go and ask the to keep it down. Knocked and rang the bell for 10 minutes until someone was leaving and let me in. I stood in the doorway uncomfortably until a very drunk girl came and said she was one of the ones who paid. I assume she meant rent but she was quite hammered and could have thought I was delivering pizza since she tried to tip me and offered me a drink. When her boyfriend clued in he came over and told me to ""have a beer and chill the f@#% out"", and told me how they disconnected the door bell because of the cops and everyone showing up and pointed at the lines of coke on the kitchen counter and winked. Wow. I just repeated I've got 2 kids under 5 and we need to sleep, please lower the volume. It was turned down, by next to nothing, I walked out and got to my door to hear everyone laugh and the stereo turned up louder then it was before. Friday night I was back at midnight, this time their front door was wide open so I walked in to find the manager (in her 50's clearly trying to recapture her youth) doing coke with a bunch of 20 year olds. It was clear at this moment we would be also breaking our lease.
Found out Bob had signed contracts with the utility provider to have regulators put on the furnace to shut it off during high peak times. I found out first day there when my air-conditioning didn't turn on in 35° weather while trying to unpack. He did everything he could to save a dime and it was always at his tenants expense, even when utilities were not included! I had to buy a couple of portable air conditioners for during the day when the central air didn't work.
Second month in I gave our notice, my son's teacher called us several times because he kept falling asleep in class because of the chaos we were forced to listen to. We moved here from 3 hours away and had no friends or family in the area, and we couldn't afford to stay in hotels so we were left with no option. Bob didn't appreciate that I served him this paperwork at the real estate office he worked at. He was very angry and demanded I speak to him in front of everyone there and asked me what was the issue and I explained (what I said above) and several more lovely moments we had, including not being able to use our yard with bottles and drug bags (sometimes still containing product) made it unsafe for our kids and was utter BS for almost $3,000 a month. (Westmeadow Drive, lower upperclass neighborhood at that time). The strange people on my patio and in my back yard, etc. Since he wanted to discuss it at that moment his coworkers heard everything and that's when I found out one of the tenants in unit 1 he told them was his daughter (later found out not his daughter but sugarbaby and saw explosive fight when he caught her with someone her age and the manager who he was also ""dating"").
After notice was given Bob sent his son 3 or 4 times a week to ""inspect or show"" the unit with no notice, and quite often forgot to bring people with him to ""show the unit to"". 
We were able to move with 3 weeks overlap of both places. On the first Thursday of the overlap we stayed at the new place and came back Sunday evening to missing boxes, damaged property and our kids piggy banks smashed and money gone. (Sentimental value as these were built by a relative that passed away a month before we moved and devastatedmy oldest). Bob told me the manager hired the tenants from unit 1 to clean up our unit and must have given them the wrong date. 
If this man's name is on your lease, RUN. It was an utter nightmare to live through and I found out with the tribunal he started putting his properties in his kids names to make it harder to sue him as this was one of MANY properties he had ""a daughter"" at.
Ask before signing a lease if the name on there is the manager/owner/caretaker. When you have to deal with the tribunal its a hassle and adds a year (before covid) to the process to track down who is actually responsible for the property.",1,1,1,1,1

I moved here because it was affordable but after a two years my rent has gone up 25%. taking a hot shower is a joke and the drains are always clogged, no matter how much liquid plumber you use. people deal and do meth out of some units. I had one resident threaten my life and became they said they were going to move out management took their side, even though I had the other person on video threatening me and yelling slurs at me. there is a feral cat problem which they don't seem to care about. when it rains the mailboxes are always flooded. it's the same with taking out the trash; there are always giant puddles surrounding the dumpster. if you have pets they make you register them with a company that requires access to your bank account rather than a simple recurring credit/debit card charge. even in the middle of covid they charge you $10 to pay your rent electronically. their tenant portal is broken and won't let me update my method of payment, so every month I have to reenter my new card details. they rarely give the legally required 24 hour notice whenever they need to access your unit, even when they need access for things that can be scheduled in advance, like pest control. the walls are thin and if I'm in a room that borders another unit I can hear everything they say. 

the ONLY good thing I can say about living here is that there's a stable power supply since we're on the same grid as the hospital across the street, and there's a firehouse about a mile down the road so first responders get here pretty quick. of course, that does mean you'll hear sirens all hours of the day and night, but they're not much worse than the constant droning from the airport. it's also a safe area to be in with a relatively low crime rate, although they did have a break in on the property about a year ago and there's a significant porch pirate problem.",3,2,2,5,3

3880,TAWANI PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,CHICAGO,ILLINOIS,60626,US,"I do not rate landlords well lightly, especially as a tenant organizer. But credit where credit is due. To be fair, Tawani manages some high-quality properties owned by one of the Pritzker billionaires, so they are hardly starved for resources. That said, they have generally been very responsive, even proactive about property management. Rents have also never gone up by more than about 5% year over year which is definitely not the case in most of the city. They were very easy to work with given that I'm on a housing voucher, and they didn't engage in the awful behaviors of most landlords and property managers around accepting the voucher or working with CHA. The only real problems that I've had with them over time is related to making sure the washer and dryers were in good repair and working properly... but there are also machines on every floor, so at worst this means going to a different floor to use a machine there. Also, losing your key is a little ridiculously expensive since they use electronic keys. As much as I hate that my money lines a billionaire's pockets even further, I appreciate the management company for being reasonable and even helpful.

Upon entering the enclosed porch through the makeshift door you'll encounter multiple infestations to greet you. Entering through the non secure door into the moldy, illegally wired kitchen where you can enjoy a cold glass of tap water reminiscent of dark ale.  We ask that you keep your shoes on at all times as we prefer to measure all of our floor boards 1/2"" short. 

Allow your attention to be drawn to the water feature ceiling throughout this home, offering multiple indoor water falls.  

In the living area you will find 6 large windows that each contain their own independant ecosystem.  Extra effort has been put into making these windows inoperable in order to preserve spore growth of the endangered black mold. If you have any questions at this point please feel free to engage with the ants that reside in the wall.  

The first bedroom will easily accommodate a chair,  and the master bedroom luxuriously offers you space for a double bed - and has its own independent water features and ecosystems.  

Bathroom includes a shower with a full size, non frosted window that looks into the bush where you can easily see if anyone is watching you; and the same dark ale quality of water as found in the kitchen.  Should you choose to change the style of the bathroom the floor tiles are conveniently not adhered to the floor.

We reported it countless times, and management responded by laying glue traps, plugging holes with steel wool, and telling us there was “nothing else they could really do since mice chew through walls.” We finally reported the problem to city officials, and only then did they seal the GIANT GAPING HOLE that was directly at the front of our building. But, next to come were the roaches. Not to be outdone, our A/C went out several times this summer and management refused to fix it for two weeks. This is completely unacceptable for families with young children or others who are vulnerable. When we moved out, we had to throw about half our furniture away due to pest infestations.

Personally he is problematic and has no problem crossing personal boundaries by throwing insults , making crude remarks about your appearance , inserting himself into you personal and sexual business (your guests , your partners) , will call and harass day or night whenever he sees fit and loves a “pop in” 

Despite never upgrading or upkeeping his properties he a prompt with the no-notice rent increases , threats to evict illegally, and random fees that serve no purpose other than to line his pockets.

Our neighbors would throw their cat litter off their balcony onto our patio, covering everything including our table and grill.

Took over a year for them to fix our toilet. And none of the closet doors worked.

3973,WESTWOOD HOLDINGS,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4E1H7,CA,"These buildings are disgusting. There have been countless building superintendents, property managers and companies in charge of this place literally it can change weekly you get notices of someone new who has come in and they are all useless and some of them are literal criminals with warrants out or straight out of halfway houses. They don’t fix anything here. They updated the electrical because it was more than 100 years old and just placed new wiring on the outside of the walls and left massive holes several feet long inside tenants units opening directly into the inside of the walls that were not repaired, mold and bugs everywhere. These units are so flimsy you can literally hear everything that happens in other units and the tenants are also so disrespectful and constantly loud but the buildings don’t care, main buildings  front doors are open and broken for months on end and homeless people are often found sleeping in the hallways directly in front of tentants doors. Rent is also not stable or controlled - they have illegally raised the rent every year Inclduing the rent freeze year they still sent notices of an increase when should have been 0 and the next year increase was triple the legal limit and it has just kept happening then they send you eviction or arrears notices. Stay away !",1,1,1,2,1
3974,CAMBRIDGE KIWANIS VILLAGE HOUSING,CAMBRIDGE,ONTARIO,N3H 5L3,CA,"Landlord is a lazy, and greedy cheapskate who ignores any and every work order I send. Building is totally infested with cockroaches and very little is done about them despite numerous complaints. The infestation is so bad, that they've practically taken over my unit, destroyed my oven, and caused the bathroom fan to stop working. Despite the unit being in clear disrepair, nothing has been done about it despite sending work orders. They're constantly trying to evict us over the stupidest of things, whether it's because my special needs children are being ""too loud"" during their meltdowns, ODSP not paying the right amount and the landlord demands I pay the full rent amount rather than the difference owed, or being blamed for the roach infestation that they've done very little about and are trying to make ME pay for all the renovations and maintenance that is THEIR responsibility to do in the first place. Despite the landlord staring at the security cameras 24/7, he somehow has a problem with me taking out my trash ""one-too-many times"", but not the drug addicts that I've caught about smoke crack in front of the entrance and had to shoo away. During unit inspections, they'll take a photo of my recycling bin having a couple of plastic bottles and call that ""clutter"". Simply put, if the landlord doesn't like you for whatever reason, he makes it very personal and tries to evict you by any means necessary, and even by illegal means.

You know this place is going downhill when they have to merge with a bigger housing company to keep themselves from sinking, AND get a housing official that works for the city of Cambridge to inspect the place, who was called in by the elementary school next door because a roach decided to stowaway in my kid's lunchbag. If you ever have to get into subsidized/community housing, stay as far away from Kiwanis Housing (who are now owned by Satellite Community Homes), as you possibly can, save yourself the trouble of having to deal with people who could care less about anything but themselves and money.",1,1,1,2,1

They didn’t give any rent relief when both dishwasher and washing machine were inoperable for months. They kept my damage deposit not due to any lawful reason.

Highlights include: Ineffective pest control resuling in long term ( over 6 months) german roach infestations (multiple units/floors).  We have had several security breaches where property has been taken- they have done nothing. It seems likely that the reason is to drive tennants out early for demoviction purposes. They have already applied to rebuild on this lot. During pandemic (when many tennants were exclusively working from home) they started multiple unit demolishments WITHOUT PERMITS to cause extreme noise distress for weeks. They are extremely poor communicators and tennants can expect suprises in general. A minor point: small community initiatives in our building: free item swap area, mini laundry library and holiday door decorations seem to be a preoccupation for this company and well worth their time to trash/ remove or harass tennants about.

3984,SKYLINE LIVING,BRANTFORD,ONTARIO,N3P 1K6,CA,"My review reflects on Skyline Living, not on any specific Resident Manager. 
I have lived at this location for 5 years as of May 1, 2023. Within that 5 years, I have lived in two different units. First unit was a 1 bedroom, and then we later upgraded to a 2 bedroom. Upon moving into our 2 bedroom apartment, we were signing a lease agreement and for some unknown reason the Resident Manger (at the time) felt it was necessary to assure us that ""there has never been a cockroach issue in that unit, but we exterminated the unit before your move-in date"" - Keep in mind, we didn't ask that question. 
About 3 weeks into living in the new unit, I'd wake up in the middle of the night to get a drink or use the washroom, only to be jumping over cockroach obstacles. I notified the Resident Manager right away, where we were then put on a list for a dusting extermination. This was back in 2021. It is currently 2023, and we are STILL battling the cockroaches. My partner and I both have contacted the Regional Manager of Skyline only for her to brush us off. We have expressed that this is is a building wide issue and that the entire building needs to be exterminated to put this pest issue to rest, but we get told ""it's too expensive"" as a response. We currently pay just shy of $1,800/month PLUS utilities. There are 83 units in the one building alone (there's two buildings on site). Hypothetically speaking, if it costed 10K to have the building exterminated and those 83 units were rented out at $1,600 each, that's a profit of $132,800 MONTHLY in Skylines pocket, but ""it's too expensive"" to exterminate cockroaches so their residents can live comfortably???? Talk about a scam.",3,1,3,5,5

They also hired contractors to work from 6-8 on easter weekend which really added some ambience to our family dinner. If I would of known this, maybe wouldn't of offered to host.

3989,MJ DOORS- JAMI JACKLIN,CORUNNA,ONTARIO,N0N 1G0,CA,"Our townhouse complex was purchased by this company just over a year ago.  In that, time offers were made to 2 units for repairs with the agreement our rent would almost double after completion.  Now keep in mind these renovations were actually repairs that were in desperate need of completion.  Our unit agreed. Paperwork was completed based on the work being completed in a timely manner and remember the word “completed”.  Work began in our kitchen the middle of May 2022 and we were told one week to complete everything maximum.  Fast forward 6 weeks later with no kitchen.  A parade of various “workers “ coming at all hours of the day and night.  Some of which we discovered had criminal records when the police showed up and one of them fled our place by jumping the backyard fence and leaving.  By the beginning of July we had a functional kitchen of you call it that.  Not up to much standard but we felt we had no choice to accept this.  Bathroom renovations began in October.  What an ordeal.  Contractors, if you can call them that didn’t bother to show up until late afternoon and completely gutted our bathroom. We were told in order for it to be completed, they would have to stay until the early hours of the morning or they would leave and go back to their office in Windsor and they didn’t know when they would be back. Well common sense would prevail that if your townhouse unit only has one bathroom in it you have no choice but to accept this to the.  To this date April 29/23 our bathroom has still not 100% been completed. The work that was done was not done properly and we have submitted numerous texts and emails to the owner and the maintenance departments none of which have been responded to. We now get threatening emails every month by being issued N4s because we paid our rent but we pay the original lease amount and not the amount that the owner is expecting- when the renovations should have been completed. We have told this person multiple times that we have no problem paying the new amount when the job is done. She refuses to reach out to us by text, email or even phone call and all communication has broke down. This company and this woman have property all over Windsor, Sarnia, Corunna, London, and St. Thomas Ontario.  They have clearly taken on more than they can handle because they don’t deal with anything.  We are reasonable people to get along with, and all we have ever asked for from her in the beginning, was respect and open communication, we’ve given it and not been given it back. Sad that people think this is acceptable. I’m not one to badmouth people by any means, but I’m on here just to make people aware- stay away from this company. Stay away from M J Doors and Jami Jacklin.  Her company’s motto is “ our house, your home”.  What a joke, sadly I hope nobody has to go through what we have gone through this past year.",1,1,1,3,1

However, by the next month, the Landlord stopped using the Property Management company and we were told that we were to deal directly with the Landlord.  He seemed ok at first, but, when we noticed that he lied about our Enbridge, Hyrdro and water bills and let him know that he had purposely deceived us, he didn’t apologize or claim that he made an error.  That was just the beginning of the horrific ordeal that we experienced with this Landlord.  We had to ask over and over again to have items fixed which were very essential to having a safe living environment.  I mean, what doesn’t someone understand when it is the winter and the furnace isn’t working? How many times does someone have to ask to have a toilet replaced because it doesn’t work? These are basic and essential to living in a safe environment.  Not to mention the rats that were in our backyard, ants everywhere in the house, bugs in the basement, wiring and breaker boards that had not been kept up properly, window screens that were either non-existent or in need of replacing, and many more issues that shows that this Landlord should be never allowed to rent to anyone ever again!  How about  The final showing up unannounced at the house and demanding to be let in so he could “check out” the premises and then hand us a N11 and demand that we sign it or he wouldn’t leave!!!!  When we wouldn’t sign this bogus N11 he freaked out and we told him to leave or we would call the police.  The Landlord also tried to evict us by giving us a N13 saying that he needed us to leave the premises because he was putting the house up for sale and that he needed to do renovations and fix it up in order to sell.  Finally, the Landlord hired a Paralegal to his dirty work.  When we were informed that the Landlord wanted to come and “inspect” the premises again, even though he was at the premises 2 weeks before, we were informed that the Landlord would be changing the locks because he didn’t like our reply!!!!  This is illegal when the tenant is currently occupying the rental house.  We informed the Paralegal as such but it took over 2 days for the Paralegal to get the picture when we informed him that if the Landlord comes and changes the locks we would call the police.  All this stress took a toll on our mental health along with the constant harassment and threats.  We ended up moving out. Even after we moved out and some mail came that we wanted to pick up, we asked the Paralegal if we could come an pick it up.   The Paralegal, on behalf of the Landlord, demanded that we pay and that we give him our new address and other personal information in order for the Landlord to give us our mail.  We had to file a complaint to the police and it was only after the police contacted the Paralegal that we were able to get our mail.  order for us to get our mail. DO NOT EVER rent any house or whatever else that has anything to do with this Landlord.  As well, this Landlord has several other names that he goes by as well as the one that is listed on this rating, one being Ketha and another one is Sinnappu Ketha.  We have no idea what this Landlord’s real name is but be aware and steer clear of this person. This whole experience turned out to be an utter nightmare.

4021,TRUMAN DEVELOPMENTS,CALGARY,ALBERTA,T3H 6B5,CA,"Brand new building.  I chose this after selling a large home and started a new life.  I was respectful and a helpful tenant (made friends and we all offered help and they were socially lovely).  Elevators flooded January/2022- building was completely without 2 elevators for almost 4 months!  That is where owners and tenants started meeting and talking.  Many residents were older (had downsized), and could not manage stairs for getting food, getting to their cars.  This was during COVID lockdowns- complete isolation.  When I complained - they asked me for a second time if I was ‘buying a unit’. I had declined 2x, 2 months before.  When I let them know I was renewing my one year to LEASE,  there was zero issue with the manager,  she said she would send me the lease.  I also told her I was asking as I had to have affaires in order before doing a medical procedure  and could not have any surprises.
‘No problem’
4 weeks later this property manger left (the only one I or anyone dealt with- the second ‘Ellen’ was harassing and very unprofessional.  
Ellen gave me a letter and said ‘my lease would not be renewed’. I was shocked, I had given my verbal and then letter of intent to stay.
They wanted me out because I was vocal and did not give up on non-working elevators for 3 months in the dead of winter.  They also had no interest in me (even though I paid on the nose each month and helped stranded residents), the moment they knew I was not going to pay $799,000 for their unit- they were ruthless.
So during lockdowns and COVID - and after I told them I had a booked medical procedure, and was physically disabled with illness AND had just caught COVID for a second time (I am immunocompromised)— by sharing these  personal health issues, ongoing disabilities- they harassed me, refused to talk to me, even after I had pleasant and professional exchanges with the property manager for the year with ZERO issue.
They had zero issues with my rent- and I kept my place like a showhome.
So they had the RRDS post a ‘hearing date’ while I was told to quarantine for 10 days- plus extra 10 days by AHS.
They used my complaint and not wanting to purchase as a reason to really shove it to me- COVID to boot.
I had to have a hearing and be out- I had no where to go- it changed my life.
I was a homeowner of 25 years- this was my first condo/rent experience.  They treated me and frankly all tenants/owners terribly.
They had a plan however- they were not honest to the RTS- and told them they went and rented my unit- not true. My 2 neighbors updated me and said it was empty for a month or more. They did rent it for $700 more than I paid — I do believe that was their goal.  They were making it impossible for MANY tenants to stay.
They did not give me my deposit back- I had about 8 witnesses there for my walkthrough- they did not show up for a walk though— and kept $2100 plus added random fix fees.  I had painted any little picture hole, and my place was keep immaculate (my neighbors saw).
I could not remove the garbage on moving WEEK- because the shoot was backed up for 7 days!!
They charged me for not being able to move a handful of double tied garbage bags ready to go on moving day—- but their garbage shoots never worked and were a constant fire hazard.  Cars kept getting broken into, security was non existent- and underground parking door either trapped cars, or damaged them.
Worst mistake of my life- I am a single mature woman, they treated me poorly once they knew I was not buying, had a pressing health matter- and even worse when AHS said I could not leave my unit for a given time.   It was impossible for me to look  for a new place. I had to stay with someone.
Let me reiterate- they did this to many people, it was abusive and especially sad during covid and everyone trying to have a safe, healthy place to live.",1,1,1,1,1

We have great building managers and staff - but they are understaffed and over-worked.   Hollyburn does not seem to care.   They continue to rent to irresponsible, dirty and sketchy renters - people who bring in the bugs and contribute to the filth and crime in the building.   There are very few surveillance cameras and no security.   In Alberta, we were hit with huge rent increases - despite the economy not being good here.   No one to speak to about this.   Hollyburn has rent controls in B.C. and Ontario, so they gouged us here in Alberta to make up for that.  Management in Vancouver are rude and unapproachable.   Suite inspections are done at the drop of a hat, although written notice is given.   We recently had inspections that went on monthly - they looked in cupboards, etc.   I have been here a long time and have a very clean apartment.   People living here with children let them run around in the lobby, laundry room and hallways with no supervision, disrupting other tenants.  Finally notices were put up - which were ignored and there are not enough staff to enforce the lease rules.   This behaviour has led to dirty lobby, hallways and laundry room.   The people do not supervise their children, do not clean up the messes they make, and let their children be loud and unruly with no reprimand.

They literally got upset at him for refusing to do it because he felt it was too dangerous. They ended up evicting us for landlord use and when we answered saying that we are disappointed but we understand, they called us both individually at work saying that we were out of line for expressing our disappointment.

No respect for your sleep schedule, but has no issue complaining to you about theirs if you make the slightest noise.   They are constantly outside, never a moment of quiet. We used to be thankful when it rained because it meant they weren’t outside.  

Ease drops on your conversations from right beneath your windows and will take hidden photos of the inside of your rental unit while doing her inspections.  Records your conversations without your knowledge. 

Keeps a journal on your day to day activities - time you spend in rooms, times you come and go, songs that you listen to on the radio as examples. Even when you look out the window in her family’s direction  is written down.    Her adult and teenage children also monitor your activities and report to their mommy on you. 

Her children run motor cycles outside day and night.  She will not do anything about it, they do whatever they want, whenever the want.   Very disrespectful.  

Does not allow tenants outside in the backyard space. You are renting what’s inside only.  


Gets mad if you change anything inside (curtains, light switch covers, hanging a tv bracket, running cable into a room) as this was her childhood residence.  

Does not recognize when something is broken and puts a band aid fix on it instead of replacing it.  The stove is from 1958 and so is the electrical panel.  Never been replaced and is likely not up to code. 

Only accepts rent in cash. Does not use etransfer or checks.  

She filed an RTB dispute on us, and was extremely untruthful during the hearing.  Made up stories on us to try to swing the hearing her way.

Repair: Appliances are over 10 years old and the landlord refuses to replace them. I have been without the use of appliances for a week at a time. I have called for repairs 4-5 times on EACH major appliance in my 3 year tenacy. Also the air conditioner can no longer keep up, repair refused. The low budget laminate flooring is peeling off the floor.

Health & safety: I have been verbally and physically assaulted by a neighbour several times and the landlord refuses to acknowledge responsibility says it’s an RCMP matter.

Rental Stability
During COVID I was asked to sign a new 18 month lease with a rent increase. I refused. I was then issued a notice of rent increase. I refused to sign it. The management have falsified and exaggerated noise complaints about my infant children. We were given an option to move to a different unit with a rent increase of $500 or face eviction. Eviction was served and disputed. The management exaggerated and gave false documents and testimony during the hearing. 

Tenant privacy 
I have caught the resident manager hovering outside my unit door on numerous occasions. My family are being watched on the CCTV cameras. Once my 6 year old stood on the lobby couch with his shoes and I was emailed a clip of video along with a complaint. My wife accidentally dropped a shopping receipt while taking out the garbage, the receipt was picked up by the RM and shoved under our door.

You can’t control the heat in the apartment, it’s controlled/turned on & off by the heating system and that’s only if the furnaces work and aren’t broken which then takes forever to get fixed or if they even remember to come back and fix them. Lack of landlord taking situations seriously like noisy neighbours constantly causing problems, you email the landlord about it but all they tell you is to call the non emergency line and make noise complaints, which is annoying seeing as the landlord should be giving the noisy neighbours a talking too and if that’s not going to solve the problem then give them 3 warnings to fix the issue or face eviction.",1,2,3,4,4

These landlords were constantly wanting to come in to our unit for example saying they wanted to check the unit every 6 months which i understand that a yearly check maybe would be reasonable as  we are two grown calm adults not distorting everything and I know that these checks are done to make sure everything is in order  but this was brought up AFTER we had moved in and not prior or mentioned on the contract. The landlords started complaining that our GARBAGE which was kept in the garage as was another tenants and the landlords garbage but for some reason it was OUR garbage that smelt as if garbage is not suppose to smell. 
(The landlords 2 lived upstairs with their mother 1 and three to four children) in the basement they had two units with my husband and I in one and another gentlemen’s in the other. 
The house started smelling like weed sometimes while we were living there and the landlords were adamant it was one of the two units down stairs because it smelt like it was coming from downstairs but part of the basement was also not accessible from downstairs but was from upstairs and was a space the landlords and their kids used. The wall between that basement space was shared with our unit and we can hear everything down when they came. The daughter would come down a lot and pretend to work out as she would tell her parents but I was able to smell the weed at that time. It was her daughter smoking in the house not any of the downstairs tenants. 
These landlords proceeded to install cameras inside the house when you come in through the side door which was the downstairs tenant main entrance. Mind you they did not have cameras outside the house. Living in this house felt like we were constantly being controlled and some ridiculous issues were always coming up (being made up by the landlord) even though we were following the rules set out on the contract and we’re NEVER not once late on rent or anything.

They don't always respond when you put through a maintenance request and you have to keep contacting their office to try to get anything done. They did a cheap renovation to the common areas over year ago, and they said it would take 8 to 12 weeks to complete (they just painted over everything and installed cheap carpet), and it's been over a year and we still don't have new numbers on our unit doors; there's just blue masking tape with the unit number written in pen, some of which has since peeled away, it looks so cheap. The cleaners that are contracted to clean the common areas do a very poor job. Carpets are not vacuumed very well, the laundry room floor is filthy, and the overall state of the common areas is just very dirty/dusty. The building used to be in excellent condition and was cleaned very well. There was a fire in the boiler room last year and black ash/dust filled the hallways and crept into unit, and a proper cleaning was never done afterwards. They upgraded the heating system last year, but then for some strange reason, the heat has not been strong enough since mid-February, it's like they turned down the output in the boiler room, so the units don't get enough heat and the windows get full of condensation over night.

The garage is sold as a communal space but it only exists for him to park his giant rv. The elevator is functional but was years behind on its safety license.

The poor guy's apartment was freezing cold by late September, and the landlord's only response to his complaints was to provide him with a small space heater and assurances that ""the window would be replaced soon"". The window was delivered and stored in the back hallway for weeks before they had contractors in to replace it!
While I lived in this building, a roach infestation took hold, and I moved out after two months of inaction to do anything about the dozens of roaches that would swarm through my apartment every time I'd walk through.

4174,JASON DAULT,SAANICHTON,BRITISH COLUMBIA,V8M 1W8,CA,"Jason and his ex wife Lindsay Dault/Horne are both despicable people that get off on bullying tenants. They think that they are above the law. It is impossible to recap everything that we experienced during our time as tenants but I have listed some examples of what we went through: 

- Persistent nagging about Illegal rent increases.
- Insisted we pay in cash (would not provide rent receipts), so they could avoid paying taxes on the income. Jason Dault explicitly stated this right after we moved in.
- Unlawfully entering our suite. On a few occasions after we first moved in, Jason just walked into our basement suite without knocking. Afterwards, we attempted to set firm boundaries - but Jason continued to text us and expect access to our suite within the same hour, etc. they didn’t have any regard for our right to “formal notice” (ex. a letter on the door,  giving us 24hrs notice). 
- Jason cut our access to heat for several months in the winter, without ANY notice. We asked him to rectify the issue of heating in our suite for several months, and he insisted that our in floor heating system (our only heat source) was working fine. Months later, Jason got intoxicated and shamelessly admitted to disconnecting our heat source because he didn’t agree with the fact that we had the temperature set above 18 degrees celcius.. in the winter time. He accused us of wearing shorts and t-shirts in the house, and insisted that we needed to “layer up” in the winter to stay warm inside. Our concrete flooring was frigid and we had already been wearing SEVERAL layers to try and stay warm inside without heat. 
- Neglected to provide us with clean drinking water during multiple stints where the well water dried up, and we were left without water for cooking/drinking/showering for weeks at a time
- Destroyed our personal property 
- Removed our items from our storage unit and tossed them onto the driveway while we were at work. The property was also used for business, so there was a lot of commercial traffic throughout the daytime, and our belongings were left outside completely uncovered 
- Opened our mail on 2 occasions (then delivered it opened). Jason claimed that he did not know that the mail belonged to us.. however, both pieces of mail clearly had names and addresses on them (one of them was a credit card sent by our financial institution). 
- Withholding our mail (ex. They delivered a letter to us, which was sent from a post office 10mins away, 2 months after it had been mailed). 
- They forged emails that they submitted to the tenancy branch as “evidence” against us. We were able to prove the emails had been tampered with (timestamps we’re changed), by summonsing the other party involved in the email thread (Lindsay’s property manager), to appear as a witness for our hearing. 
- They made 2 false reports to bylaw about us, in an attempt to get around the RTB ruling 
- Jason attempted to block me from leaving the property by parking his tractor behind my vehicle and then videotaping as he watched me struggle to maneuver out 
- Maliciously cut our wireless internet (they are away we work from home), then downgraded our internet plan to one that would not work for streaming. When we finally resorted to setting up our own wireless network, the landlords would not allow the installation guy to access the control panel in the main house
- We have 5+ police reports filed against these guys

4175,SKYVIEW LIVING,HAMILTON,ONTARIO,L8V2K5,CA,"For the four years I lived there, there was a constant cockroach, and eventually bed bug problem. They hire a budget exterminator, who doesn't do a thorough job, just so that they can write that they took care of the problem.

The maximum amount of time they give you for notice on anything is 24 hours. Even if you're doing a bed bug prep, it's only ever 24 hours. They have entered my apartment without providing notice before. I was told to just, ""Call management and complain"". They are constantly looking for excuses to intrude into your apartment. There is zero privacy in that building.

In addition to pests, there is a big black mold problem that they never fix. If you ever want to notify management about anything, you have to directly speak to the superintendent Mike. He refuses to do any correspondence through email or through text. It all has to be in person, verbally. He doesn't want a record of any interactions on paper, in case he gets brought to the landlord tenant board, he doesn't want anyone having any proof of any of the things he does.

When I moved out, they tried to charge me with a whole bunch of spurious claims of damage to the apartment. There was a little bit of a mess that I cleaned up, and that was about it. When I got a lawyer involved, they dropped all the charges.

Avoid this place at all costs, as they will not respect your privacy, they will intrude into your apartment, you will have pests from the moment you move in, and they don't handle noise complaints at all, of which there is a ridiculous amount of noise in that building.",1,1,1,1,1

I'd much rather be able to pick my own servicer and cost, as opposed to paying $65 monthly for wifi I have no say in.

Given that so many of us had work orders in place with Bylaw to have the damage and mold rectified, this landlord took the opportunity to issue N13 orders to force us out by November 2021 so he could raise the rent once any salvage work had been completed.

We didn't have a working oven for 7-8 months and we submitted work orders 3 times, eventually they did give us a replacement oven but it was used and not in the best condition or clean.

4218,EIWO CANADIAN MANAGEMENT,WATERLOO,ONTARIO,N2L 3V3,CA,"Since moving into a unit managed by Eiwo a few years ago I've been:
1. Threatened with eviction for not following unwritten/unposted ""rules""
2. Threatened with eviction for their own paperwork mistakes
3. Threatened with eviction for denying them access to my unit after receiving illegal entry notices

Every time I call the main office to talk about these issues or maintenance, they ask if I've spoken to the on-site property manager. When I respond that after my prior interactions with him that I will not speak with him, they concede that I'm not the only tenant who's taken that stance and they know there are issues with him. The office manager for this property never returns phone calls and somehow is never in the office when I call at any hours of the work day. When there are issues with winter maintenance (parking lot ice that both myself and my child have fallen on) I'm told they're having issues with the contractor. Not my problem, Eiwo is ultimately responsible and needs to figure it out. There is no accountability or sense of responsibility at Eiwo. I have been renting in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for over 15 years and Eiwo is by far the worst I have dealt with so far.

I'm not a difficult tenant to deal with. Screws came loose on my door knob, fixed it myself. Cheap cupboard door fell off, fixed it myself. Toilet flapper leaking, fixed it myself. Fuses, light bulbs, smoke alarm batteries, I handle all of it myself. I was raised in rentals and my parents always handled whatever they could before asking the landlord to look after it. The only significant issue I've asked Eiwo to deal with in the unit is sewage backing up into the basement. Which has been a repeated problem for the past 2 years! Instead of fixing the actual pipes they just keep calling in a company to snake the drains when someone complains about them backing up again.

4231,WILLY WANG,SAN FRANCISCO,CALIFORNIA,94127,US,"Willy was one of the worst landlords I ever had. He'd intentionally only sign a lease with one master tenant so they'd be responsible for the entire rent of our 3x2 apartment ($3500). He'd also exclusively rent to and target college students to prey on their ignorance. He'd say threatening things like, ""If you don't bother me with repairs, I'll keep rent low"" while increasing our rent every year after our fixed term expired. Getting a single repair, even when legal and necessary, was like pulling teeth. The downstairs neighbor was aggressive and would verbally abuse his senior mom (he was 30+, she was 60+). He'd play loud music throughout the day and scream profanities at random times. I wrote to the landlord multiple times about this concern and how it infringed on our right to quiet enjoyment but he didn't do anything about it.

He wrongfully used the entirety of our security deposit (4k) to repaint the interior of our 3x2 apartment to cover his repairman's spotty repair work. When we asked for an itemized receipt, he asked, ""What's that,"" and what purpose did we have for one. Yes, 4k for one guy to paint a 3 bedroom apartment. 

The apartment was not maintained. The kitchen looked exactly as it did in the 80s with a broken oven and refrigerator. No new appliances, dingy, dirty carpet throughout the apartment, and loud, aggressive neighbors below you. There wasn't adequate weatherproofing so water and wind was able to get through the bottom of the windows.

Anytime someone new moved in, he required a new security deposit. When I finally moved, I insisted on a final walkthrough and an itemized receipt. He sent his repairman who didn't speak English. In the walkthrough, he said everything was good but my landlord still charged me for things. I asked for price estimates on repairs and receipts because I knew he'd never given a previous tenant an itemized receipt. In the end, he was so fed up with the itemized receipt that he threatened to sue me for giving him a hard time.

They let our roof leak for 4 years. It damaged the floor, no repair is to be done for the floor. ""I'm not paying for that""

The windows aren't sealed correctly and leach humidity into the walls and cause black mold to form. There's black mold on our blinds.

The landlord asked if we'd like to pay more rent (donate money to subsidize their lifestyle) because of ""upgrades to the building"" which was, a bad hallway paint job that ruined the apsrtment door insulation. Install of a gate around the parking lot with key access only. Only people who pay to park get a key which means if you get locked in there as a guest when you're leaving, you're potentially stuck.

4239,HOPESTREET MANAGEMENT,CALGARY,ALBERTA,T1T1T4,CA,"Renting through HopeStreet was the worst rental experience we have ever had. Since the day we move in, we faced several issues and it was one headache after another for the term of our lease. Simple maintenance requests took months to resolve and other concerns were completely ignored or brushed aside. In my experience with other property management companies, it has never taken more than a week or two to complete a maintenance request. Cleanliness and Maintenance of the Unit Prior to Possession - Upon moving into our unit, NOTHING was clean. Prior to seeing the apartment on move-in day, the property manager warned us ""This unit needs work"". We spent over a week deep cleaning the apartment after moving in, getting to a livable standard. A cleaning service was brought in for a couple of hours, but this was not enough. We have had to spend a significant amount of our own time and money repairing holes in the walls, deep cleaning the inside of the apartment (piss on walls in the bathrooms and food and grease in the kitchen) and the patio that was covered in dirt, garbage and hair. Every single surface was disgusting and needed to be deep cleaned. We unclogged drains and disposed of garbage and belongings that were left behind. Items that were damaged or broken were never taken care of or fixed. False Advertising in Rental Ad  - The unit we rented was advertised as being pet friendly. We double-checked this several times during the application process and it was confirmed that pets were allowed under board approval. A few months into living in our unit, we applied to get a pet but were notified that pets will only be approved for owners in the building, not for renters. This should have been verified with the board/owners prior to even advertising the unit. We paid more than the apartment was worth because we were told it was pet friendly and we turned down several other properties under the pretences that we would be allowed to have a pet and the approval process wouldn't be an issue. Poor Communication and Irresponsible Staff  - Every person we worked with was extremely slow to respond to communication and seemed like they didn't care about their job in general. Every time we reached out, it took weeks to hear back in general and took several follow-up emails to even get an initial reply. I always felt extremely uncomfortable around our property manager. He is a very large and abrasive man who made some very unprofessional comments. When he completed our move-out inspection he closed the front door so hard that he broke the door!!

4242,HOPESTREET MANAGEMENT,CALGARY,ALBERTA,T1T 1T4,CA,"Renting through HopeStreet was the worst rental experience we have ever had. Since the day we move in, we faced several issues and it was one headache after another for the term of our lease. Simple maintenance requests took months to resolve and other concerns were completely ignored or brushed aside. In my experience with other property management companies, it has never taken more than a week or two to complete a maintenance request. 

Cleanliness and Maintenance of the Unit Prior to Possession
Upon moving into our unit, NOTHING was clean. Prior to seeing the apartment on move-in day, the property manager warned us ""This unit needs work"". We spent over a week deep cleaning the apartment after moving in, getting to a livable standard. A cleaning service was brought in for a couple of hours, but this was not enough. We have had to spend a significant amount of our own time and money repairing holes in the walls, deep cleaning the inside of the apartment (piss on walls in the bathrooms and food and grease in the kitchen) and the patio that was covered in dirt, garbage and hair. Every single surface was disgusting and needed to be deep cleaned. We unclogged drains and disposed of garbage and belongings that were left behind. Items that were damaged or broken were never taken care of or fixed. 

False Advertising in Rental Ad
The unit we rented was advertised as being pet friendly. We double-checked this several times during the application process and it was confirmed that pets were allowed under board approval. A few months into living in our unit, we applied to get a pet but were notified that pets will only be approved for owners in the building, not for renters. This should have been verified with the board/owners prior to even advertising the unit. We paid more than the apartment was worth because we were told it was pet friendly and we turned down several other properties under the pretences that we would be allowed to have a pet and the approval process wouldn't be an issue. 

Poor Communication and Irresponsible Staff
Every person we worked with was extremely slow to respond to communication and seemed like they didn't care about their job in general. Every time we reached out, it took weeks to hear back in general and took several follow-up emails to even get an initial reply. I always felt extremely uncomfortable around our property manager. He is a very large and abrasive man who made some very unprofessional comments. When he completed our move-out inspection he closed the front door so hard that he broke the door!! Luckily this never came back to us as a charge, but everyone we worked with at HopeStreet we found to be extremely unprofessional.

She owns most of the homes around the ******** area of MUN, and mostly rents to students. She is a very predatory landlord, and seeks out students on purpose. She asks extremely nicely to your face to trick tenants into trusting her - she is all vinegar, the honey is fake. She rents out houses that are in disrepair and have not had even paint updated since they were built. The home I rented was still full of lead paint, as well as plenty of mold. She freshly paints the OUTSIDE of her houses only - so they look OK from the street but are falling down inside.

She does not follow the tenancy laws. Her apartments do not meet fire safety laws. The one we rented did not have a secondary exit in case of a fire. She also does NOT keep her homes in a good state of repair (we had a ceiling leak so bad that it rained inside while raining outside and we had to go to the tenancy board to get her to replace the roof, she was refusing to do anything and it was VERY bad). Days after moving in we discovered the apartment was infested with Silverfish - she refused to do anything about this and we had to purchase stuff from Costco on our own dime to try and get rid of them. They were falling from cracks in the ceiling still when we moved out.

She refused to return our damage deposits and we were forced to file through the board to get that back as well. ",1,1,3,4,2

4263,SUNRISE MANAGEMENT @ LAUREL 42,PORTLAND,OREGON,97213,US,"Sunrise Management took over the building about six-ish months into my lease, and management went straight downhill. The first manager, Marie Ooten, made a written agreement with me for parking fee reduction due to frequent issues with our garage situation, but failed to honor said agreement. The subsequent manager, Courtney Adamowicz, also failed to honor this agreement despite further repeated issues with the garage, including a garage door that was stuck wide open for almost a year in a high-theft neighborhood.

Said parking situation, which is an automated platform matrix, was also damaged by another resident at some point in the day, and when I arrived at home and contacted the emergency maintenance hotline, I was blamed for the damage by management because of inaccurate information from the on-call tech, which they didn't bother to follow up with me about. And when I corrected them via email, they didn't bother to acknowledge it.

I had a microwave/range hood combo unit break, which left me without kitchen ventilation for almost a month while the management company (not the maintenance guy) dragged their feet on approving a replacement.

This same management company was also emailing residents encouraging them to mass-report a houseless campsite down the road from us, calling it ""unsightly"" and insinuating that it was having a negative impact on the apartment community. They also tried to put up fencing to prevent another camp from forming on the sidewalk, but were fined by the city because it was a public sidewalk and they were causing a pedestrian obstruction.

And, as if to mock us, they have held a few catered ""ice cream socials"" at the building for residents, but always schedule them during the middle of the morning when everyone will be at work, presumably so they don't have to interact with pissed-off residents.",1,2,3,3,2

Many other items went unheeded or required several reminders (roof leaks, water coming from under cabinets of unknown origin) and when we purchased a home we gave written 30 day notification to vacate. A week later I was washing dishes at the sink (stainless steel counter) and touched the water to check temperature and received a significant shock. I reported this to the property manager and was asked about the shower, an odd transition. The water heater was leaking into the back of the switch and outlet by the sink, electrifying the water. The electrician came by and shut off that portion of the breaker, and a plumber fixed the leak, but the landlord refused to have the repairs completed so that the disposal and dishwasher were functional again.

He was aware of structural problems, a broken foundation and holes in the exterior walls and did not disclose this either. After move in, once a month the plumbing would back up and cover the floor in sewage. This was so bad and happened so often that I had to buy electric drain snakes 100 feet in length to reach the clog. A number of occasions this came up with plant matter, so it seems like something had breached the pipe. Twice, the ceiling developed a leak from a rubber drain tube that was run through the attic which would be chewed through by rats that lived in the attic. The entire building is falling off of a hill which caused the foundation to split in half, so there are many holes in the exterior of the building, this lead to constant battles with pests. In addition to learning how to be a plumber in this property I had to learn how to become an exterminator. In my time there, I used permethrin to eradicate a roach infestation when I moved in, a flea infestation from the rats and many others due to the holes in the structure. Inside the building there were massive holes behind the water heater, blower and the oven, these were areas the rats used to get in an out of the walls. I exterminated three rats living at this property that lived inside the unit. Every month I had to clean under the fridge, couch and oven to clean mounds of rat feces and urine. 
During all of this I tried to be a good tenant, not bother him too much. In the end he decided he would keep my entire security deposit $1800, except for a dollar, which he mailed to me for a couple of 2mm chips in the counter. Stay far, far away from this landlord.",1,1,3,5,2

She also did not want us to leave until her house was sold and put us in a situation with children to have 3 months to leave or POSSIBLY be able to stay. We didn’t want to take that chance and wanted to move. We asked her if we could use her as a reference she said yes and made a letter for me. When my real estate agent found us a house we didn’t get the place because SHE TALKED HORRIBLE ABOUT US! So we couldn’t move early. We lived there for about 10 years! Had a good relationship and understanding for a long time. The tiles in the bathroom fell and she wanted us to fix the tiles and lied to me that the downstairs gave her the cock to put on the tiles. The basement people were violent and abusive. She aloud them to live there and they were vulgar. Screaming and yelling breaking our kids toys (electric car) and waved a tool in my face. I asked about the tool to use for the tiles. I ruined the tool because I am licensed and I didn’t know how to fix the wall. When we did finally move she tried to come after me for damages. The walls were peeling due to the paint that was used, and the tiles were falling. She also didn’t give us our interest every year nor gave me receipts.

I forced her to have things in e-transfer because she did lie to me about money. I came straight from the bank with cash money in the envelope. She wouldn’t count in front of me and said we can be friends you don’t need the receipt. After she closed the door she quickly re opened it and said I was missing money somehow. I was always upset about that. So I forced e-transfers. I was glad to because when I was paying utilities she would lie a few time oh I didn’t pay the portion. Then realized I was pregnant and said oh I see it here never mind.

Devi told us that we didn’t have to pay full rent on the first but pay majority and then a few days later the rest. She said to be helpful and be able to give us a break from anything. She used that against us saying we don’t pay rent on time even know that was a verbal agreement. She was nice enough to allow us to have internet under her name and we paid her the 100$ every month.

They only had a physical office nearby the first year or so we lived there. We had to pay rent through an online portal that charged us $2 per month to use. That same system would send us late fees and notices for things charged *after* our rent was due and that weren't due until the next month's rent was due.

One month, they charged us two months' rent at the same time. Thank goodness we weren't on autopay!

They installed a faulty toilet that ended up costing us an over $1000 water bill. They ""graciously"" let us pay it in installments.

On another occasion, a different toilet leaked down into the basement and destroyed a non-load-bearing wall and damaged the ceiling tiles. We tried to get them to fix these issues for at least 18 months, then after we moved out, they tried to charge us for the damaged ceiling tiles that they'd failed to fix.

They were good about only coming when they had our explicit permission, but during the height of the pandemic, their main handyman would come to the house unmasked.

While management did come by to spray the home, they did not spray the entirety of it, leaving me to ultimately have to fix the issue myself. 
During a “quarterly inspection” on 10/20/2021 office managers did not even knock on the front door and made their way through my home. They attempted to barge into my room while I was in the shower but luckily my bedroom and bathroom door were both locked. They INSISTED that they could not wait until I got out of the shower to come in after I asked them over and over to let me get out of the shower and get dressed. They continued to bang on the door to which I had to open it in a towel. It felt very violating as they told me “it wasn’t a big deal that I was only in a towel, they just needed to look in my room”. 
Early hours of 12/20/2021 put in a work order for a cracked and leaking toilet. Left me without a toilet for over a week. Only when I called corporate and threatened to call the city of Stillwater did they replace it. 
Jacob Lemons came by to discuss why I called corporate. When I said “signing a lease here was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made,” he replied with “yeah we hear that sometimes.” And dismissed it. Very unprofessional and showed backhanded sympathy. Also gave the excuse “well they’re college students” when told that some office staff were rude and unprofessional.

4306,JENNINGS GROUP,EUGENE,OREGON,97402,US,"I live in an apartment managed by Jennings Group at the Westmoreland Village complex from 2016-2022. I would have lived there longer, but the rent increased too much so I had to move in with a friend instead. 

Management is very respectful and professional, but it takes a while for maintenance workers to arrive to fix anything. There's one issue they said they looked into, but I was working from home during the lockdowns when I reported this issue and no one ever showed up. Every summer wasps had been getting into the apartment. It got bad enough summer of 2020 that I would find up to 10 wasps a day buzzing around the living room and kitchen. I checked outside (as much as I could since I was in a 2nd floor apartment) and didn't see any nest by the window. Maintenance eventually arrived and sealed the gaps between the wall and ceiling where I suspected they had been getting in, but didn't inspect for a nest. I suspected they might have built a nest inside the wall, but nobody ever came out to inspect it. You would think the landlords would want to make sure the structural foundation of their property was secure and stable, but apparently not. 

Also, when I moved in they gave us a date we could move in by, so we planned everything around that date to allow us enough time to move from the old apartment and clean it up and put in our notice at the old place. We ended up having to practically beg the old landlord to let us stay another 3 weeks because Jennings Group kept pushing back our move in date due to renovations. After a couple weeks of this I told them to only make necessary changes and not aesthetic renovations because we could not stay much longer at the old place and needed to make sure we would have a roof over our heads. We were finally able to move in about a week and a half later, but it was incredibly frustrating. 

Once I moved out of this apartment, I left before my lease ended when my friend found a house to rent and asked me to move in with her right away. It was a great deal that I couldn't pass by, so I spoke with management about it and we came to a deal where I wouldn't have to pay any fees to break the lease, but would be responsible for rent until another renter is found, which they said usually only took 3-4 weeks. It took them three months to find a renter and didn't advertise the apartment anywhere. I received conflicting emails as to whether I still owed rent or not throughout that 3 months, so I paid for the first month and then focus on my new place instead. I spent three straight days deep cleaning the apartment before I moved. The estimate I first received stated it would take my entire $800 deposit to cover the costs of preparing it for a new tenant. I kept following up on new renter status and the status of a final bill with receipts and pictures showing all the supposed work they had to do. After three months they found a new renter, and then when 30 days passed without receiving a final bill with adjustments for any interim rent due, I sent them another letter objecting to various line items on the itemized estimate (objected to carpet replacement charges after I lived there for 6 years, cleaning charges when I deep cleaned the place, etc) and sure enough, within an hour of sending the letter pointing out they violated the law to give me a final bill within 30 days of finding a new renter, I received all the pictures and receipts I had been asking for, as well as a message that a deposit refund check (around $400) was waiting for me to be picked up the same day. 

So some shady practices, but overall alright. I was willing to keep living there, after all, until rent increased too much. Just be sure to take pictures when you move in and when you move out, and be prepared to fight them about the final bill so you can get some of your deposit back.",3,3,2,5,5

I checked into it and they haven’t been paying the water bill with the money I provided.

I had been residing there for 4 years and was going on my 5th year( this had become our home as it was just me and my special needs son and we really replyed on stability hence the 4 years here).  I had warned them that there was problems with mold, walls crumbling and full of cracks, plumbing problems that the previous landlord promised to fix but didn't so they assured me it would be taken care and they told me "" I would never want my children to live in these conditions so why should yours"". This gave me so comfort.  However months passed and nothing was done, in fact someone had brought in cockroaches to the building. She was warned about all these problems and some how it seemed things were getting worse. Rather than fix it she told me I was getting annoying. They told me if I were to continue they would find a way to kick me out of the building in spite the fact I had never missed a payment or ever been late on rent.  To my surprise only 2 days later I got notice of repossession ( She claimed she wanted her elderly parents to retire in my apartment) Which made no sense because why would you want your parents to live in a mold and cockroach infested building. Jean francois had shown signs of aggressiveness, had yelled at tenants and even abused his position of power by buying others in the building into being silent.

4326,JOE WATTS,EDMONTON,ALBERTA,T6C1E3,CA,"I was a tenant for about 5 years. It was a 6 unit walk-up building, 2 below-grade  three-bedrooms and 2 bachelors, 2 two-bedrooms. Rent was fair, it stayed stable with modest increases every couple years based on upgrades he did, which he also gave us the option to decline if we didn't want renovations happening or any rent increase. Most tenants were lower income. Maintenance was timely and done well. I felt he took pride in the building and truly cared about providing a good home for his tenants. He seemed to consider 'fit' for the building overall whenever new tenants came in. He talked with me and my roommate (and likely the other tenants too) for example, when he had a small family looking to fill the other unit on our floor when there were no children in the building at the time. Most tenants were longer term ... minimum of 1 year with some 5-7 years at the time I lived there. I moved out in 2019 to move to another city. It was a safe, stable home. 
Sometimes he could be a bit condescending in group messages when stuff went wrong in the building related to tenant responsibilities, that is the only reason it's not all 5 out of 5 ratings but in all fairness to him, it was usually infuriating disrespectful or immature shit (ex. coin-op laundry was by-passed regularly by a tenant; someone left the door unlatched and the coin-op part was broken open; he was getting email warnings from the internet provider about piracy and it kept happening even after the first time he talked with everyone; the cigarette butt can was knocked over several times and none of the smokers bothered to clean it up; someone I subletted to left mud all over the stairs in the common area instead of cleaning up after himself when the common spaces were always tidy before that; someone started smoking weed inside in a non-smoking building). 
While living there I had heat/water included in rent as well as spotty internet, access to storage space in locked garage or a shed (he'd have to open the garage for you because his maintenance stuff was stored there but he was at the building weekly or more for maintenance anyway), a fenced shared yard, coin-op laundry priced properly for utility use and wear/tear not priced for profit. One tenant brought in bed bugs and Joe was upfront and immediately treated every unit and common area, not just the affected one. The bed bugs didn't spread, stayed isolated to that 1 unit and he had pest control in 2 or 3 times .. the last time the person that brought them in had to essentially empty the unit & put their stuff in freezer storage or trash it and then there was no more issues and there was no spread ... I was even sharing my vacuum at the time with tenants on her floor who would have used the same laundry as her which would have created huge risk for a big infestation and no one else was impacted at all. I continued renting there for another year or two I believe afterwards and there were no further pest control needed. Throughout living there, he put in all new flooring (timing he coordinated with us to be done during a planned trip so there was no disruption to our daily living), new toilets, new baseboards, and bought us paint and let us choose the colors for the entire unit, replaced the largest window in the unit. I only moved out because I was leaving Edmonton. I've rented from several other small landlords and a big corporate kind and Joe was by far the best landlord, it was the most stable and home-like home I ever had while renting. I am now a fairly new home-owner and I have even greater appreciation for the care he took in maintaining and upgrading the building. If you have the chance to rent from him, he is the only landlord I've had (out of 8 total) that I can enthusiastically recommend.  He doesn't exploit his tenants for profit. He provides a service at a fair price. As long as you respect him, his building, and the other tenants, you'll have a safe and affordable home.",5,5,5,5,4

Hollyburn properties is the single worst management company I have ever dealt with. We lived with them for 12 months and moved on as soon as the contract allowed. Unfortunately we were rushed into signing as we had to move unexpectedly from our previous apartment due to roommates suddenly leaving the country.

We were told that construction in the building would ""wrap up in another 4 weeks or so"" before we moved in. It went on the full 12 months. They either lied to us or hired grossly incompetent contractors, not sure which is better.

The building was run down and old (hence the need to have contractors there patching concrete cracks that let water in through the parkade all year).

They charge above market rate for their poor quality buildings. Even when you compare to a similar room in a building managed by another company next door. They rarely have all the amenities of a ""modern"" building, but that will not stop them billing you as if they had them.

I was yelled at by a property manager for asking to have my ac worked on in the winter. The system they had installed was misfiring and my thermostat was reading 90. This started it all. 

The land lord I mentioned by name took it upon himself to harass us and threaten us with fines for some gardening tools.

4355,SHIRLEY COTE,COLORADO SPRINGS,COLORADO,80919,US,"Moved into to Shirley’s basement on a 6 month lease. After 2 months we mutually agreed to end the lease prematurely without penalty and I am planning to move out 5/10. She advertised the space as private, quiet, with wifi and utilities included. This was a stretch of a statement. 

Her wifi has a a very poor connection and is not rated for multiple devices running both up and downstairs. Would frequently get kicked off and have to use cellular to limit burden on her wifi. It is not for any type of remote work despite her telling me that her previous tenant worked from home most of the time.

The electrical capacity Shirley’s basement is not rated to support more than two electronic items running at the same time. I would frequently trip the breaker if running anything beyond a hot plate and the refrigerator. As a result I was forced to spread cooking appliances (microwave, air fryer) across different wall outlets and circuits.

Constant banging and ruckus upstairs above the bedroom at exactly 10pm every night.

While it was made clear before signing the lease that her laundry room was a shared space, Shirley began to create additional rules after I moved in, primarily limiting what I could cook, where I could clean my dishes, and when I could do these things in order to avoid exacerbating her and her daughters “allergies”. I agreed to her terms of course—any dishes can only be done upstairs in the kitchen and dishes and laundry can only be done Sunday at noon or Wednesday at 6pm but have to be done before 8pm.

I work as a psychiatric professional with gravely mentally disabled individuals and comparatively,  Shirley was very passive-aggressive, accusatory, difficult to please, and generally extremely challenging to get along with compared to many of my own patients. Her home is simply not set up to rent out more than a couple weeks at a time. Similarly, with all of her allergies and maladies, Shirley is not equipped to be a landlord.

4366,RANEE MANAGEMENT,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4X1N3,CA,"I rent in a building downtown. Company fired the rental office manager the week we moved in. He'd been here for over a decade and seemed like a kind, gentle person well liked by everyone in the building. To replace him, they hired an absolute horror show of a rental manager who is unhelpful and rude in the extreme. She will actively try to find ways not to do her job, does not respond to emails and is never in her office. When she is reachable she is infuriatingly abrupt and cold. Even simple matters.

The building superintendent is an obvious misogynist who was rude to my partner from the moment we moved in. She was trying to get access to the elevator to move in and, after being rude to her, he made us give him $100 to use the elevator as a ""security deposit"", money which he refused to return to us until we argued with him. ""Who you gonna complain to, eh?"" was what he said. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

I had a work vehicle with a sticker on it in my parking space (which I pay $100/month for) but despite that he didn't believe I had the right to park there and called in parking complaints four times, getting me over $100 in tickets, which caused friction with the company I worked at. His complaint was that I was parked in the wrong spot. I wasn't. None of the spots in the lot were numbered and he wouldn't tell me where I -could- park. In the mornings he would wait at my truck and yell at me. After I escalated this conflict the building repainted the parking spots and issued me a permit for the same numbered spot I'd been parked in. A few months later I came home from a weekend away to find someone else had parked in my spot. I had a highly recognizable vehicle which everybody passes on their way out of the parking lot. I parked in another spot nearby and the next morning came out to find my vehicle had been towed across the city which cost me half a day's work and $350.

It's a private 1 bedroom in a building. The superintendent has entered my unit without authorization or notice, changing smoke detector batteries and doing other things. I have a silent security system so this is how I know. A few weeks ago he tried to force his way in with threats, when I was home, because a neighbour's sink was clogged. I asked him for 24 hours notice and refused him entry and he returned handing me a slip of paper dated for the previous day, forging a document granting himself entry. I continued to refuse entry and he started yelling. Ultimately he went and snaked the sink from the neighbours side. He didn't need to enter my unit, as it turns out.

There are cockroaches, fleas and bedbugs in the building. There was feces smeared on the wall in the hall for 5 months and there's dog shit, from a very large dog in the back stairwell at least once a week.  The laundry machines never work, which is ironic because I'm pretty sure it's the Landlord's family which also owns the laundry business. Every few weeks someone gets evicted from the building. It's almost always a man in his 40s, who sits on the lawn outside with all of his possessions, looking bewildered, until the police (who the building calls) come and make him leave before throwing the possessions he can't carry in the garbage. 

The building's stairwell and lobby are used as temporary shelters by people who may or may not be former tenants and because of this delivery drivers will sometimes refuse to deliver for safety reasons. And it's not a low rent or community housing building. Also, the same man has yelled racist obscenities from his top floor window between 3AM and 6AM for the two years I've been here and management has done nothing, despite complaints from the whole street and multiple visits by police.

They would call me to confirm and the she would argue with me over the phone about just letting her in. 
Utilities were included in the lease and I received a notice to resident of the hydro being cut off for nonpayment. And when I called hydro to advise that I was a tenant in which my lease included utilities my landlord called me to tell me hydro made a mistake. The guy who lived below me told me that when he first moved in the hotwater had been shut off and it took a month to repair. 
When I first moved in I told her about 2 screens that were missing and the entire 2 years I lived there, she never repaired it. The ac broke twice, both times when i first turned it on for the season, I had to argue with her to repair it after she blamed me for breaking it. When the repair man came he told me that it has needed to be replaced for several years and she calls every year for a quick fix that he advises after the fix would stop working again. When I moved in the place was filthy and was not cleaned and she would not let me pay for someone to come in and clean before I moved in even after offering to pay per diem rent for the few days before so the cleaners could come in. The place was vacant.
Overall she was constantly argumentative, pushy, rude and insulting. I am in the legal field and I would constantly  advise her of my rights as a tenant and her responsibilities as a landlord and I can't be bullied.

They don’t fix the toilets or things that are broken until it’s been weeks and finally causes an inconvenience big enough where they have to get involved.

Health and Safety Rating: 
I’d give it a negative review if I could. Constant complaints about bed bugs, roaches all over the place (which they try to normalize like oh it’s Hawaii) most of the tenants are mentally unstable, constantly slamming their doors and yelling and fighting with each other, people poop everywhere, the toilets are constantly being filled up with food and random items and there is a monthly cleaning fee charge but the cleaners don’t even clean. Everything is dirty. 

Rental Stability Rating:
A lot of the units are paying different rates and for what? Why are some units $628 a month or $700 when you have units that are $1,000 and most of them are less than 90 sq ft and shared restrooms and showers. It’s ridiculously absurd. The pictures on the website are from years ago don’t even come close to what the units actually look like. 

Tenant Privacy Rating:
They have a key code door to your room that literally tells them on their app when you come and go. They don’t let you have access to it and they do monitor it. It’s honestly very creepy. They say they give notice to enter your unit but I have experienced firsthand throughout the 3 years I have been here that they barge in. This has happened to me at least 6 times. Also once I saw their maintenance guy on the roof looking into people’s windows and it was very scary.

Respect Rating: 
I don’t even know where to begin with this one. 

Overall: The management of this company and the way they treat their tenants is not good. They don’t care though because it’s just money to them. They are constantly violating rules and even convert garages to shove three people in one room. They overcharge tenants and don’t care about maintaining their properties and don’t bother giving tenants even a simple bed frame. The boxsprings are literally on the floor. This landlord is not a good one and I don’t recommend them to anyone. Yes the google reviews are high but those are from years ago when the company first launched and a couple of fake reviews.

We have a number of tenants with walkers, canes, etc. After a power outage, the elevator is often not available, and we have to wait for a few days before a technician comes to reset it. It is a three-storey building with one small elevator which takes 3 minutes to travel from the basement to the third floor. We are also not allowed to use this elevator for moving. Understandable considering its size and type. Meant primarily for wheelchair access. Recently, the Lobby Intercom System was not operating. Deliveries were unable to contact individuals to tell them their delivery was there or, if they phoned, they had to go down to get the packages, heavy or not, by themselves. It was very inconvenient and took from April 5 to April 22 to be rectified. It took a month for someone to fix a broken dryer vent in my apartment. The landlord has just advised us to remove all belongings from the balcony if possible, so they can clean the windows. I can clean our windows easier and faster than it will take me to remove all belongings. There does not appear to be any compassion from this company.",1,2,3,4,3

4430,BOARDWALK PROPERTIES,LONDON,ONTARIO,N6J1W1,CA,"I rented from Boardwalk Properties a few years ago and it was the most horrible experience I ever went through. Whenever it rained my basement would leak and flood. Water would literally stream down the walls and I would have inches of water on the floor- I can’t count the number of times I had to call their head office in Alberta bc the property manager in my area would no longer take my calls. After MONTHS of calling and threatening legal action they repaired the exterior bricks (which only fixed part of the problem) and then MANY more months later they had a sump pump installed. I finally had enough of living there and bought my own house. 3 months after purchasing my house I found out that my old neighbor had a really bad case of bedbugs, which Boardwalk knew and didn’t tell anyone else, and I brought them with me to my new home. Bc I had no warning I wasn’t looking for bedbugs and by the time I realized I had them it cost me a fortune to exterminate. 
The new tenants to my old unit reached out to me and told me that they wished they never moved into that place bc the old pipes burst and ruined so much of their things. 
Also every time the maintenance guy would come over my cat would hiss and get upset- he never did this with anyone else in his 17yrs alive- I’m almost positive that guy hurt my cat when I wasn’t home. 
I could go on and on about how horrible they were but you get the idea.",1,2,3,3,3

While York did bring us space heaters and eventually offer us a rent reimbursement it didn’t make up for the logistics of living through a cold fall and early winter with no heat. The worst part was when we finally heard back from a York rep after many unanswered phone calls and messages they claimed quote “they didn’t know we were cold.” At the end of the day you’re always just going to be a number to a company like this, and even when they’re doing something illegal you have very little recourse. We still live here because we love the building and our neighbors, but this situation really showed us York’s true colours.

If you rent a room in the house, be careful not to be too nice or talk to her a lot. She will start asking you to convert to Christianity, and constantly bash other religions. She will accuse you of the things you do not do in the house or accuse you of being evil because you do not follow her religion and did not know God or have God to guide you. This lady is very ignorant and disrespectful. She will yell at you for this or that (if something happened in the house) even you do not do it, she has a camera installed in the living room facing the kitchen area (to watch you), she will always say God knows all when she accuses you of random shits. She is controlling too. And she studies bible everyday but has an affair with her best friend, the big Jewish man living in the same neighborhood “Harry” while her husband is away in Quebec.

4490,GREG SHANNON,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K1V0H9,CA,"Please beware of Greg Shannon of Petawawa. Where to begin. First off he does his own repair and doesn't hire professionals to get the job done right. I had to take care of mice infestation on my own. I had to to deal with sewage back up seeping in the basement which was a health risk, it smelt of feces in the basement. Greg didn't take any of my concerns seriously. He came down and mopped the mess himself and didn't even get a professional to assess the issue. I had to hire my own guy to make sure all the feces were properly removed and painted over. Then he has the gall to weaponize the Landlord and Tenant board tribunal against me. He also negated on a rent reduction that we both agreed on in writing. Then when I moved out he claimed I owed him in back rent. So now he has a judgment against me by the biased LTB for thousands of dollars. I NEVER LIVED RENT FREE AND PAID MY OWN RENT AND PAID FOR REPAIRS OUT OF POCKET YET THE LTB SIDES WITH HIM. He is punishing me because he knew the Landlord and Tenant Board would side with him as he is known to them. Almost like they're in cahoots with eachother. Lastly, he broke into my home and set off the alarm. Police came and found no one. My neighbour got so scared she took a picture of him fleeing. THE OTTAWA POLICE SIDE WITH HIM AFTER I REPORTED HIM A DOZEN TIMES. This man is a danger to all tenants. If you rent from him he will weaponize the LTB against you and is cozy with the Ottawa police services!!! Your rights are not there. I'm a single mom and he seems to rent to people who are poor and with no support from friends and family. I just am trying to live a decent life raising my kids living pay cheque to pay cheque, paying rent on time yet he ignored and disrespected me which left me infuriated and frustrated for the first time in my life. He really did affect my mental health because renting from this man has made me feel unsafe, unheard and my rights completely ripped apart by the Landlord and Tenant Board and the Ottawa Police Services. So much so I moved to the US to live closer to family. Canada and especially Ontario allows the rich to do whatever they want to the little people. Greg Shannon has abused his landlord status and every TENANT WILL GET HARASSED, UNFAIRLY SUED because he knows how to work the system as a slumlord, he will manipulate the LTB and law enforcement to get his own way and of course bogus judgment orders. He did tell me if moving day that he did sue his previous tenants, so this is a pattern: RENT, PAY RENT, MOVE OUT, GET SUED BY THE LTB!! Your safety and mental health will suffer because you are literally dealing with a dangerous slumlord....and when I mean dangerous, I mean you will feel so alone that even the Ottawa police services would sneer at you when you ask for help and protection. As a woman, I am worried female students or women will be mistreated by this man. I hope this post helps save some vulnerable people HELL from Greg Shannon.",1,1,1,1,1
4491,LOISE KIRINDA AND JAMES MBURU,BRAMPTON,ONTARIO,L6X5E2,CA,"This couple was the worst to rent from. Charged 1700 for their very dark, low ceiling 2 bedroom basement (the 2nd room barely fit my double sized bed) and no walk room)
They constantly allowed their children to play in the hallway that leads to our apartment with their  all at 7am when they have a whole backyard to play in. When I spoke to Loise about the noise nothing changed.
They told me laundry was once a week (I chose Sunday and they said they do theirs on Saturday but yet, they did laundry any day of the week and expected me to pay for the water being consumed. No repairs done prior to me moving in (the shower head literally fell off in my hand and no hot water at random times).
They told me I had to shovel the ""barely there"" snow that my windshield brushed off my car, yet I had to hop the curb every day just to get into my ""parking spot"", ruining my tires and cap. I had a slip and fall because they never cleared the walkway to my apartment or put salt, just their driveway (even though they said it wastheir job to do it). Unfortunately I could go on about more things but needless to say all they cared about was their mortgage being paid but lacked respect for me and my family and didn't care to do any home maintenance or encourage a peaceful living environment.

Their staff are rude and difficult to deal with and seem intent on making life difficult for their tenants in any way possible. 

Despite trying to appear as a fully fledged company, all they really do is work with other who own the homes which leads to a very unclear structure for renters from Caledonia as you never quite know who your landlord actually is. They are also very bad at dealing with safety issues. The lighting circuit in the house was actively dangerous, and this was confirmed by an electrician - however they refused to spend the money to fix it at all, meaning the lights would go out regularly (at least once per week).

 Building is literally jimmy rigged together. 
Owner bought as is, cabinets fell onto me, he fixed them himself barely knowing what he was doing. They're all off center. Never paid for damaged glassware. Some cupboards are missing doors. 
Unfinished basement with possibility of black mold. Bathroom has black mold. Mice, rat, and flea infestation, he bought and distributed 4 traps per apartment, rather than actually dealing with the issue, (fixing holes outside leading into the apartments).
Floor ""tiles"" (stick on tiles from the 1950s) are completely damaged and cracking under our feet. Leaving us with plywood floors, he refuses to do anything about them. Walls have holes from previous tenants, hasn't patched any of them up. (Including a giant hole behind our washer and dryer that my cats get into, leading them to the walls and the basement where the other neighbours find them occasionally.) 
Electric box blew, he had to replace it, took him a week before he called anyone, was almost 2 weeks without power, then had the audacity to tell me I had to pay the 3k for the new electric box. (Which is also outside, pretty sure that's illegal and not safe). 

Basement walls are basically just boards, I can easily go through to the other tenants basements and upstairs to their apartments. (Unsafe)

Winter is like living in a cardboard box. No insolation whatsoever. I can feel the wind coming through the doors and walls. Especially in the living room, kitchen, and bathroom.
Balcony is about to collapse under my feet. It's unusable. 

Complains about how he had to spend 10k on new windows for the entire apartment block yet left my bathroom window untouched, it's cracked and held together by bathroom silicone. 

Baseboards in bathroom are nonexistent, showing off the gorgeous innards of the walls. 

Toilet seal around the bottom of the toilet doesn't last no matter how many times you redo it. Because the floor is uneven and the entire toilet moves if you sit on it wrong. So that's fun. 

Refused to put my boyfriend on the lease even though he's been living with me for over 2 years. 

Raised rent by 25 dollars the first year he owned it. Then again 20 dollars the next year. This year he tried to raise it another 20 dollars and I refused his increase. He became extremely hostile, rude, and started harrassing me, because ""it's only 20 dollars"". 

Shows up unannounced, and tells us he's allowed to enter whenever he wants to. (Claims it's an emergency when called out for illegally entering my apartment). 
Overall scum lord. If ever this name pops up on your lease or he shows up looking to buy your block. Move. Attempt to find a new place asap. He wants money money money.

We have a 6 year old and she is not running jumping etc but any noise she made, the Smiths would call Moe and complain. We were to the point of emailing him every time we went out as the Smith’s were complaining when we weren’t even home! The final straw came when he submitted to the Rentalsman tribunal.

4528,ANJANI DIAL-HOWIE,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M6E 2E8,CA,"You’re in for a wild ride with this property!

Before I begin listing off the problems with this room, here’s a little info about it.
It is a small and really narrow 2 story house with a basement(you share the house with the landlord btw), located in the heart of Little Jamaica in Toronto.

Now to the fun part. The rent for a single room here is 1000$ CAD a month which I wouldn’t mind if the landlord and the property would actually be of the quality expected for 1K a month. Starting off the list, there is no heating in the room during winter nor cooling during summer, I was freezing my ass in my room and to be outside was warmer than being inside, texting the landlord would not fix this issue; during summer the house would become a big hot sauna and changing temperature on the thermostat would be punished and turned back to normal because it is “too expensive.” Moving on, the internet quality is complete trash, I would even say that the internet doesn’t exist there, so if you’re a student, or a work-from-home worker, or just simply want to use Netflix or play on your console, then you simply can’t, because the internet doesn’t work. Continuing the topic of tech, there are often electricity outages on this property, because the landlord has too many dollar-store appliances connected everywhere that constantly put pressure on the electricity leading to shortages that happen regularly twice or thrice a month. Also the washing machine experience is just painful, because either the landlord or her boyfriend do not know where to put tide pods and instead of putting them in the drum the put it into the liquid detergent dispenser and simply clog up the washing machine causing it to stain your clothes with the leftover tide pod bits in the dispenser. Moving on, the landlord steals! Yep that’s right, they steal, i caught them once stealing my food from the fridge, I have also caught them using my detergent that I forgot to take back into my room, also worth mentioning that the fridge space is limited and you also don’t get any space in the freezer, on top of that the fridge space that “belongs” to you can be used by the landlord even though they told me(before I moved in) that the fridge space won’t be touched by them. Next, we have pest issues, I have witnessed countless amounts of cockroaches and since the landlord, once again, did not care , I had to invest into my own cockroach traps, ohh and also the landlord leaves their fruits and other food out for long periods of time so fruit flies are very common. Finishing up, the room quality… while the room itself is spacious the furniture there needs to be freshened up, the bed is broken in some places, there are also holes in the wall that were left from pictures hanging there. 
So yeah, it was my little complaint about this property and I want to save people their money, time, health, and nerves(I myself moved out on the brink of a breakdown) so I strongly suggest you to avoid this landlord and their house at any cost, because there are many other rooms that are better than this and cost less!!!!


P.S.

4532,NIRAV THAKKER,WEST YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND,LS165RQ,GB,"Stayed in a house owned by this landlord for a calendar year and received such little value for money considering the rent we were paying and such appalling customer service between them and the estate agent. Moved in and the flat hadn't been  cleaned, there was broken furniture that wasn't there when we moved in and the fridge door was broken. Landlord took 35 days to sign off on getting the fridge replaced in which time we had no cold food storage, depriving us of a basic human need. Flat was entirely electric and only two heaters in the WHOLE FLAT worked. There was no modern ventilation in place so mould built up easily, spent a good portion of the tenancy with a nasty cough as a result 
To top it all off, despite leaving the property in a better state than when we found it the landlord tried to deduct a 3rd of our deposit off us, which we negotiated down given a small bit of wear and tear we took ownership of but given that we never met them for the whole tenancy and based on the property's previous neglect and their lack of urgency in replacing essential household items was audacious and entitled to say the least.

They still claim that I never put in a work order( even though i have literally keept documentation of all the conversations/emails regarding it) talk about gaslighting!! 
It took me six years just to get the mould in my bathroom fixed( which was part of the lease agreement when I moved in)- they did a horrendous job! Gaps between the shower/wall and door frame/wall, and only painted the patchwork they did for the mould! and even then it took 5 week for maintenance to come back and do it properly… unbelievable. 
  I never had a working buzzard when I moved in, they had three maintenance workers and the Tenant & Community Relations Specialist come to see for her self, I was as told “ WRH will never pay to fix it, as they would have to replace the whole building”.  I was left speechless! 
Fast forward to 2020 and Covid, I was sick and awaiting test results. Since I had no working buzzard, and the Key Holder refused any home aid/pharmacists entrance so that I could get medical help, i had to break quarantine, not knowing if I had Covid or not ( mind you alot of elderly people live here). It’s wasn’t till the EMT had a hard time gaining entrance into the building- my family called 911 as I passed out on FaceTime; they FINALLY fix it AFTER I contacted a lawyer!! 
All in all, they see us as sub human. 

Oh they also allow their key holders to illegally enter our units, without our permission or notice.
Apparently, they are also OK with other tenants (men) buzzing the single women who live here and harassing them. There was an incident where the man actually try to get into a woman’s unit! One night I had 6 Miss door calls between the hours of 11pm-4am.

We have an active T2 claim against them with the LTB after they put us through 6 months straight of daily renovation construction noise during the first lockdown of the pandemic when we couldn't leave the house. That's when they were busy doing shoddy renovations of the units they had evicted using confusing zoning rules they use and abuse at their leisure. Now we have had no choice but to file a second one because they rented out the basement unit directly below our unit for $5000/month to a bunch of idiots running a music recording studio that uses their unit like a party space day and night. 

There is very little soundproofing to speak of int building. This is a former textile factory converted into live-work units and has never been properly soundproofed for occupancy. The only thing separating units is a thin layer of hard wood. I can hear people cough, burp, fart, cry, fuck, even sing in their shower. If I spilled a glass of water, the entire content will flow through the ceiling into the music studio below us. Before NJS owned this building, the previous landlord was an elderly man who charged below market rate BC of the substandard soundproofing and warned every new tenant about the lack of soundproofing in their lease agreements. We also had a superintendent who lived on site to help mediate noise complaints and for the first 8 years I lived here it was an amazing place to live and I absolutely loved my unit in spite of the lack of soundproofing.

Obviously NJS is not telling any of the new tenants about the lack of soundproofing. New tenant pay nearly 3X what the old tenants pay (who all have rent control). As a result, NJS has resorted to seedy, unethical methods such as weaponized noise pollutoon to get older tenants with rent control to move out so they can start a new lease and charge higher rent. When they first took over the building, they removed the common area laundry & dryer for months, saying they ""needed repairs"", only for the machines to come back later 2x more expensive than before. They are lying scumbags and are actively turning affordable rental buildings in low income neighbourhoods throughout the city in Parkdale, Regent Park, East York, and Scarborough into overpriced slums. They are also developing condos — they bought the former Guardian pharmacy at Queen and Lansdowne.

4585,DEVONSHIRE PROPERTIES,MISSISSAUGA,ONTARIO,L5J 4M9,CA,"Overall I believe the landlord overseeing the apartments at 1201 Walden Circle does a very good job. The only concerns I would have are that repairs that are performed for the units tend to be quick fixes rather than solutions, so upkeep of the unit over the years can be questionable. For example, we had a counter with no framing or support underneath due to previous damage and it sunk down enough to prevent the cabinets from opening. When they arrived to make the repair they were ready to simply cut or remove the cabinet doors rather than support the counter itself. Thankfully I informed them of what I thought was needed to fix the problem and they actually listened and were able to add some framing. We also put in a few orders for pest control due to ants and it was dealt with quickly, however, we did have to get multiple treatments done on separate occasions for a suite higher than the 15th floor. My other concern stems from the fire alarms and elevators. The fire alarms go off frequently so I know they work, but I believe they need to be changed because they emit a high pitched noise that I know my partner and those with decreased hearing abilities do not notice or wake up to in the middle of the night. Additionally, one of the two elevators is frequently shut down for maintenance/repair, and yet it still lurches from time to time which is absolutely terrifying. Otherwise there is always someone in the office during open hours that is ready to help and the staff are very friendly.

We told them we would like to discuss breaking the lease without any fees because of our dogs new fears. They refused to break the lease without us paying around $10,000 in fees. So we had to stay. They constantly told us that we could get kicked out with only a 3 day notice whenever another complaint came in and if that were to happen we would still have to pay the lease breaking fees. But we couldnt afford to leave. Those were some insanely stressful months as we had to wait for the lease to end worried we could be rendered homeless in 3 days. They kept telling us it was because they cared about the tenants safety. But if they really did, they would have let us break the lease. Instead they wanted to try to get more money from us.

4622,KAMRAN TAJADOD,RICHMOND HILL,ONTARIO,L4C9M5,CA,"Disappointing Experience with Kamran Tajadod, Iranian Realtor in Richmond Hill, Ontario

I had the misfortune of renting a property managed by Kamran Tajadod, an Iranian realtor based in Richmond Hill, Ontario. While I was initially excited about finding a place to call home, my experience with Kamran quickly soured due to his blatant disregard for the law and a lack of professionalism.

Firstly, Kamran attempted to force our family to vacate the property without any legal grounds. He seemed to be well aware of the laws that protect tenants, but chose to ignore them in favor of his own interests. His primary reason for trying to get me to leave was to illegally increase the rent for the next tenant, which goes against Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.

To add insult to injury, Kamran threatened that if I didn't move out, a family member of his would move in – a clear intimidation tactic meant to make us feel insecure in my own home. This level of unprofessionalism was shocking and left us feeling uneasy throughout my tenancy.

Furthermore, Kamran showed a blatant disregard for the maintenance of the property. When a part of the ceiling became damaged, he refused to repair it, claiming that it was too expensive. This negligence not only caused discomfort but also posed a potential safety hazard for me and other tenants.

In addition to the lack of repairs, Kamran never took any responsibility for the upkeep of the outdoor areas, including lawn care and snow removal. This negligence led to an unkempt appearance and posed additional safety concerns during the winter months.

Overall, my experience with Kamran Tajadod as a landlord was incredibly disappointing. His disregard for the law, unprofessional behavior, and refusal to maintain the property made for a stressful and unpleasant living situation. I would strongly advise prospective tenants to avoid renting from Kamran in the future.",1,1,1,3,2

Next, take the name I've given with a grain of salt, because I'm pretty sure it's a fake name. They never gave receipts, rent was paid in cash. The landlord was not declaring the extra income they were taking, which is illegal, as was renting this house. With a full house, the landlord was making $2500.00 a month. The landlord was renting a basement apartment and two rooms upstairs, and I was in one room for almost a year. This house is not meant for sublets. In case of fire, there was only one exit out of the house that was accessible. The kitchen was on the main floor, and only one bathroom upstairs. The rooms had a bed with three drawers, a dresser, a mini fridge for food, a chair and a t.v connected to cable everyone was allowed to access. The landlord had cameras all over the house, used to spy on us. She accused one tenant of cooking for someone else and threaten to charge extra for gas or throw the tenant out. She accused another of bringing too many groceries home. She regualrly broke into the rooms and searched them, and when she saw something she didn't like, she would send paragraph long text messages, or stick post-it notes in the kitchen and washroom. If she felt you had too much stuff, she would threaten to throw you out if you didn't store it somewhere else. From my understanding, no one had a lot stuff, as these were small rooms. The post it would say things like, take a 15 minute shower only. Don't let things accidentally drop in the toilet. Only cook food that you yourself would/can consume. Very petty notes. She was renting to adults, but acted like a headmistress in a boarding school. Tenents were not allowed to have guests sleep over, or visitors without getting her permission. She claimed years back it was because she had a young son. Not sure what the excuse is now. Pets were not allowed, and later on plants beause she claimed it would create some sort of bug that stung really hard, just weird. The scariest part of the house was it was maintained by friends of the landlord. Wardrobes were taken away and replaced with four planks of wood and a pole to hang your clothing. This was drilled right into the floors. All the eletricity was done by another friend. In one room, two of the outlets burnt out, one was located right behind the bed the tenant would sleep in. 
The Landlord also rented to very scary people. One tenant was seen on camera dragging out the body of their friend that had OD'd in the basement apartment. Turns out the friend was ok, and the tenant was kicked out. Another tenant hadn't moved in, but was having their welfare cheques sent to the house. They were fresh out of jail with new tear drop tattoos on their face. It feels like this landlord was renting to vulnerable people, people who she could manipulate or kick out easily with minium damage to her. I noticed people who were legit and stronger she'd coniviced or hassled to force them to leave as soon as possible. Basically my experience was bizzare, annoying, and at some points dangerous, and it wasn't cheap, and she should have issued receipts. IMO the city needs to pay this house a visit and note all the red flags and shut her rentals down. The Federal govenment needs to get involved and charge her all the taxes she owes. 
I do not recommend this rental to anyone. It's absolutly illegal. You will not be able to prove you live there or get your money back if something goes wrong. This person is scamming people, and is taking advantage of the rental situation and it's wrong. I'm posting this review to warn people, but also to hopefully get some justice for all the tenants, myself included that were ripped off and harrassed by this woman. Ideally, I hope one day she is never able to rent to anyone again. If it was up to me that would be the reality now.",1,2,1,1,1

4643,FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC.,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4B 2T5,CA,"My review is on the Forest Hill East York location

George is an ok guy. He can sometimes be good & easy to talk to but other times especially when it has to do with other tenant issues & management he can be shady. He has the right intentions but maybe doesn’t want to deal so much with tenant problems. 

For example, if you’re having a dispute with another tenant he doesn’t do much at all unless you keep nagging him about it and have other neighbours who are having the same issues to back you up. And don’t even get me started with Ally. 

She can be a pain in the ass to talk to. She is quick to dismiss your issues and immediately tells you to talk to George or “send an email” rather than actually listening to you and making you feel welcomed living there. I know she is just the front desk person but don’t just make people feel like their problems don’t matter. 

Other issues besides management. Not sure if it’s just this property or a lot of Forest Hills residences but there is a huge problem with roaches. Landlord approves anyone at this point. Also their laundry rooms are horrid! So dirty and dark. Half the time the machines don’t work and take your money.

Their property manager ended up stealing my rent so they took me to court with their fancy Toronto lawyers for non payment of rent. I had all my receipts and they were so unorganized (not even sure what month they were accusing me of non payment) so the case got thrown out. Gave my notice and left after that stress.

We had constant other issues with the suite, including water pipes freezing and lack of internet (included in our rent)

Once I stayed up all night to continue to bail out the sewage that was backing up into my back tub so it didn’t flood my apartment. I was constantly straining to hear any sounds of water or dripping so no backup went unnoticed. I set up a camera so I could monitor the area when I wasn’t home. It was the most stressful time in my life.

In the end, he used the disrepair of the house due to longterm neglect to evict all three tenants for repairs and renovations, saying “you know, this place hasn’t really been maintained for 40 years.” As if it wasn’t his responsibility.

I was threatened with eviction a year before the final eviction, but when I got a paralegal they withdrew the first filing. In the end, his lawyer daughter negotiated with us, 6 people who had lived a cumulative 27 years in the building, less than $5000 each to move at the height of the pandemic.

They then spent what is probably $500K to gut and reno all four units and re-rented them for triple what we were paying.

I rented the Basement, throughout the years, it seemed like for 2 of the 5ish years they'd be doing renovations upstairs which started early in the morning and messed with my sleep, it was really loud and often shook the whole place. 
There were no bedbugs or roaches, the place was pretty nice (there was centipedes and Silverfish bugs but I didn't mind them too much). They respected my privacy but did have a cleaning person come in once randomly and wake me up thinking they were going to clean the basement too (no one told them there's a Tenant?) 

Wiring for some things were questionable, the fan above the stove worked intermittently and we had a light fixture or something randomly start a fire in the middle of the night due to faulty wiring, fire dept had to come!
Promised some repairs / fixes I never got, I'd have to bug em for anything to really get done. Oh and the entry way was always leaking water when it rained, had to scoop out dirty water to prevent the place from flooding a bunch of times! 

After about 5-6 years of staying there, also during the Covid Pandemic when it was pretty bad, they said they wanted me out to 'renovate' the basement apt. They said I could come back but I'd have to pay more rent.  They never gave me any proper notification in writing, but did email me and mention they'd give me a months rent back If I left in 2 weeks as they were planning on starting their renovations. I think it was even before that they started renovating, so that wasn't a lie, they were literally tearing through the ceiling and pieces were falling down on me and my friends as we were moving my stuff out, and I never got that months rent back as promised.

Naina would harass and bully tenants over her wrongdoings. When the boiler in the building broke in FEBRUARY they left us with no heat for months, providing one space unit per unit to get by.

4662,INFINITY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT - LEE CORBIN,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M5N 1A2,CA,"This review is specific to the rental building at 122 Fifth Street in Etobicoke ON managed by Lee Corbin of Infinity Property Management. This is a small building with approx. 12 units rented by several long-term tenants, and some newer tenants.  
With all the nightmare stories out there of horrible landlords, I feel like we are very lucky to have an owner and property manager who are helpful, respectful and take care of this building and are respectful to the tenants.  
The building was purchased by a new owner about 3 years ago and they hired Infinity to manage the property.  I was worried that we'd lose personal access to a building manager with a ""property management company"" being involved  (our previous property manager was a private individual vs. a company and he was fantastic). But, I needn't have worried. Lee Corbin from Infinity was assigned as the new manager for our building and he is personable, makes his direct contact info available to residents, he'll respond to texts very quickly and responds to issues/inquiries right away. 

Also, the building owners ensure that the building is maintained well, and follow LTB rules with respect to rental rates. I've never seen them or Lee the property manager be unfair. 
I'm sure this site will have plenty of poor reviews, but I thought I'd emphasize that there are great landlords and property managers out there too.",4,5,5,5,5

She's SO bad, she's got THREE (3) names/aliases! This review is for 171 St. Clair Ave. E. in Toronto, Ontario, however she also owns 500 Dawes Road which is an even WORSE property! BOTH have the same Superintendent Dan Anderson, a 60-something, alcoholic, potentially retarded, misogynistic, obese and abusive waste of human excrement. He and his constant companion Courtney, make up Dumb and Dumber in managing this property. For years, interior corridors has had peeling paint, bicycle wheel tracks on the walls and uneven leveled stairs at the back entrance which MANY people have tripped on as they were NOT properly torn down and replaced but ""patched"". Patch, should be the nickname for this property, incidentally ""the jewel"" in this old lady's crown. She owns the place and is in her 80's (evil never dies!!), and has her middle aged son come and pick up the rent checks. If you want to enter from the front, you'll need to climb over the jumble of filth that is the humanity the Superintendent ""socializes"" with, including any sexist jeers that come free with the price of passage that is almost always blocked! The place is so hot (furnace has been broken for years!), everyone routinely walks around in shorts and tank tops in the middle of January (unless you're ""lucky"" enough to live on the same floor as the drunken Super...and endure his staggering and mumbling as he makes his way down the hall in the late evening hours after chugging his body weight in Heineken!!). Complain about anyone in the building and they'll just pay for his silence in beer. Meanwhile, you live in a near constant racket as the building is so old you can hear EVERYTHING and I mean....everything. I should NOT know my neighbour's ""safe word""!! The Super will go ""investigate"" the offending noise and then go and join in the merriment, point and laugh at you, while you pull your hair out seeking a modicum of calm. It's a vile, disgusting boys club. Don't bother trying to call, visit or serve the Slumlady. She doesn't answer calls (it constantly goes to messaging), and her address up in Richmond Hill is to a Plaza with a PO Box. I'm sure she's made it her life's work to avoid being served legal papers! She is SHAMELESS in her attempts to money grub -- yes, I think she DOES plan to take it with her! She routinely tried to implement illegal rent increases INCLUDING (get this!!), trying to get those increases to apply RETROACTIVELY - before she EVER served the papers. The Super just lies and says he served them. No man, you were OVER-SERVED that night! NO notices went out and what do the people that live there do? THEY PAY THE ILLEGAL INCREASES. Why? Because they CANNOT find anything cheaper or more centrally located in the city than The Inglewood. I've spoken to some who don't dare complain for fear all the complaints make the Slumlady sell the property. Her idiot son will be set for life. I think that's the plan. Just run it into the ground! There are also a lot of nice Filipino residents here who don't necessarily know the LTB laws and again, are too intimidated to stand up to Dan the bully, and they can't find anything cheaper/better. I honestly think 171 St. Clair is where hope goes to DIE. Do NOT rent here. The place is full of backwards-thinking people; the pack rat on the 2nd floor, the 3 guys who drink and drug themselves to the point of near death in the 3rd floor unit in the elbow of the building... The only people I can recommend to live here would be young, single bachelors who don't care about sleep, safety or filth or those that simply cannot find anything better.

4684,MARIA KALEDINA,PICKERING,ONTARIO,L1X 1S4,CA,"I rented a basement apartment from Maria in 2019 and the apartment was full of mold so badly there were mold mites in the bedroom. The mold affected my whole life I experienced headaches and physical effects as well as mental effects. 
When I moved in, her ‘brother‘ lived on the main floor (another thing, I never actually met Maria, her brother co ordinated everything so who knows if she even existed.) and he had dogs. Ok no problem I love dogs. But then like a week later the dogs left never to be seen again and I’m awake one night hearing crazy noises in the ceiling(floor space) and walls come to find there’s fucking mice and I’m 99% sure the dogs were just there to scare them or cover up the sound. When communicating with Maria she wasn’t rude or demanding or anything and she did let me break my lease with just one months notice after I kind of used the landlord tenant act to my advantage. To be clear, I didn’t find the mold and mold mites for a couple months and that was the breaking point for me I was understanding that getting rid of mice takes time and the house was on a ravine.",1,1,3,3,3

After we were in (August), we learned (through the tenants union) that the gas had been out since May. The landlord eventually swapped out all the gas stoves for electric after overhauling the buildings electric to support the increased draw. 

They also illegally deregulated the rent for almost every unit in the building and don't follow the rent reporting laws. We are currently in the process of attempting to get our unit under rent regulation again. Terrible landlord.",1,1,1,3,1

Repairs would often take a while to be completed because of the continuous no shows, but eventually got done. 

Rent was higher than he’d said it would be at first showing, which he explained to be from the inclusion of appliance that didn’t arrive until months after moving in.

It is a revolving door when it comes to keeping maintenance staff, been down to one again since January. Security is so bad that anyone can enter and leave the building any time they want. Water leaks were so bad that tenants were getting sick from the mold, Morguard answer was to contact your insurance company and have them pay for a motel room for 3-4 months and put your furniture in storage, one tenant did that and moved back in, two weeks later it was back to leaking. The list is to long for this review, tenants have been recording their stories and plenty of pictures to backup everything, The Property Manager is rude, refuses to do anything and becomes very confrontational when you complain, it is her way of not having to deal with it, you get warning letters that you will be evicted for not paying rent, even when you show your bank statement that the check was cash by the landlord, you are expected to go to the bank and pay for a copy of the check. How hard is it to assign payment as paid when the unit number is on the check?

4721,SAICKLEY PROPERTIES,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K2P 0A9,CA,"Saickley was very hands-off with our unit, which contributed to privacy - they weren't hovering around like I've had with other landlords, but they didn't come in for anything. We inherited the unit from other tenants who passed along the lease from other tenants, all of whom spent multiple years in the same unit, which made the rent very cheap at the time. They would cross out some names and put the new ones above it, so when we got a new roommate, there were over 12 crossed out names on the lease.
That was decent, but it was very telling that the landlord was just making money off of us with absolutely no work, besides owning the place.
When we did need repairs due to the older unit becoming decrepit from regular wear and tear, they became hostile and much more involved in our lives. The front doors' hinges and keylocks were rusting off and breaking, making our unit incredibly insecure, to which the landlord accused us of ""partying"" that lead to the hinges and locks being broken. When we actually did a walk-around the unit, our personal items were commented on and ridiculed. It wasn't until we made legal threats that they did the bare minimum of repairs.
Finally, when we moved out, they charged us extra and illegal fees. They charged us a cleaning fee despite not providing a walk around of the unit, an additional month of rent on top of the 60 days notice we provided, and removal of appliances which was their responsibility. While these were disputable and illegal claims, they never took any of us to claims courts for these and could be ignored - it was definitely an attempt to get some extra cash off of us before they did the necessary massive repairs or renovations for a new lease of tenants.",1,1,2,3,1

We moved in a month before the COVID lockdown, and during so they checked in on us and asked us if we needed anything. They treated us like family. We later got the opportunity to rent a full house rather than a smaller condo, and they were more than willing to work with us to an agreement on ending our lease early.

They kept revising the rental agreement well into a month into my time in their basement apartment so I didn't entirely know what I was getting into. They offered no privacy. We started off sharing laundry machines. They would come down into my apartment with only 15 minutes notice every other day ""for laundry"".  They would also come into the apartment with no notice when I was not home to ""do repairs"".  It was completely un-liveable.   They were just constantly in the apartment. There were many problems with the house, including heating. The heating was not properly functioning and I had to go without heat in the fall and winter for quite awhile. They supplied space heaters but not right away. I froze.  They had two giant rottweilers that suffered from separation anxiety. Whenever the owners would leave in the morning the dogs would bark and cry for at least an hour every single day. There was no sound proofing or sound insulation so I had to hear this as a start to every morning in the house. The relationship with them soured and they began to bully me mis-using various landlord notices to intimidate me. They bought a separate washing machine as noted by the maid but were still invading my privacy to wash the dog's things every few days with the machines I used for my clothes. When I told them I wanted to move out quite early they wouldn't return my deposit for last month's rent even though I wasn't going to stay there more than a few days into the month. They also made move out difficult refusing to open the side door to allow me to maneuvre my furniture out the cramped side entrance of the house.  Horrible experience. I lost money. They profited. My entire time there was torture.  They even called the cops on me and my father when my dad put himself between me and the rottweilers when Justin was trying to bully me.  Truth be told I think the wife was jealous or concerned and that's why she was trying to exert so much control over me by invading my privacy all the time. Otherwise I can't imagine why things would start off so negatively and then just get progressively worse to such a level of toxicity.

4767,PRAIRIE RIDGE,MOUNT HOREB,WISCONSIN,53572,US,"Lived here for quite some time. Prior management was terrible. Caught them on video lying about me to the new owners. Installed security cams in my apartments since the prior building manager would come in unannounced to ""change the lightbulbs"" (a tenant responsibility, and bulbs were not burned out) and gave a master key to his brother, who made master keys for all new tenants (which I found out when another tenant used his own key on my unit by accident and the door unlocked!). When the new owners bought it, they got unnecessarily rigid about certain rules while failing to maintain the building to a good standard. They improved some things, such as the landscaping and changing the locks due to that master key situation. But the hallway lights fixtures (in common areas, not individual units) would still leak water when it rained. Some units also didn't have hot water more than once in a blue moon. And the shared garage door would still get stuck in the open or shut position. The building is slummy. I don't know how much they've overhauled since we moved out but there is so much black mold in the walls already that I would advise against moving in unless you can verify that they have done some MAJOR repairs. And run the hot water in the evening in the unit before you sign a lease. If you can get it during peak hours, then they may have actually fixed that. I doubt it though, since they had installed a new water heater before I left and it fixed nothing since the new water heater was at a capacity that a homeowner would consider okay for maybe 3-4 people, but to heat water for a whole building with many units.

4770,TARA NEGUS,TRENTON,ONTARIO,K8V0E2,CA,"Tara was kind during our viewing of the property & during the signing. There were 3 of us on the lease, me, myself and a family member. Two vehicles. Our landlord owned the upstairs, we shared the entry and laundry. We didn't have a door seperating our apartment (her basement) to the shared entrance. She knew we had a cat and allowed it despite the no door for us. Eventually, she said that our family member had ""over stayed"" despite him being on the lease and paying rent? Also told us to keep our cat downstairs, which is impossible considering we have no door. So I put my beds headboard at the stairway. She gave her boyfriend the code to the front door, and in the middle of the night i was home alone, and i heard the door code being entered and opened. Then boots being taken off. I was in the middle of doing laundry, so i eventually had to go upstairs to switch it over. Only when i went to do so, my clothes had been tossed to the side so he could do his. She had come downstairs early in the morning to get someone to come look at the furnace, but had not told us before hand so we were unaware they were coming. My fiance worked shift work so he had quite literally just gotten to bed. He yelled towards the stairs ""where's the notice"", and she yelled back ""what notice"". Our family member decided to move out due to her constant harassing of him being there. She's a flight attendant for the military and lived in Kingston, so she was only in town during layovers. So it's really odd that she was so worried about the members of the lease living there. There was no stove, only one window. So it isn't even a legal apartment.

I have no experience living in the townhouses, but the management and repair staff are the same between them. The rents are very affordable, and even if the units themselves aren't fancy they're clean and taken care of. There is one dedicated maintenance man, but the building has companies on call for specialty work like plumbing, and a company comes in once a week to professionally clean. Work orders have always been dealt with promptly, with proper notice given and respected for unit entry. The building has a debit machine in the office to pay rent with if you like, and they will also take interac transfers which I appreciate, I think it shows that they want to take our convenience into consideration. At one point a resident's family was expanding and building management offered them first dibs on a larger apartment so they'd have more room for the baby without having to move, which was very sweet to see because they could have just posted it at market but they gave it to them instead! Changes like laundry machine fees are voted on by the residents instead of just making the decision and posting a notice. Barb, the building coordinator, is a delight.

Do you like black mold? How about fridges without shelves, or appliances so old they die? Or, for the truly brave, how about living above someone who has a locked door while you have absolutely nothing, not even a baby gate?
She was caught on camera sneaking into the rental living space around midnight on more than one occasion. Under the kitchen sink is full of black mold that she refuses to remove because then she'd have to replace the countertop. The washing machine died because it was over 20 years old and she did not replace for two weeks. Between September and December 2022, she harassed the previous tenants over a drip she claimed to hear even after at least 4 plumbing or other contractors told her there's nothing wrong. She accused her previous tenants of lifting heavy weights on the top floor and somehow damaging the room, even when the tenants had nothing of the sort and weren't even home at the time she accused them of lifting weights. She planted sound recording devices in the common area and the garage (which was supposed to be just for the tenants). The by-law office was called when she cut the power to the central heating and let the temps fall to 16 degrees in November. After she got in trouble for that, she had a technician move the thermostat to the basement (which is her private residence with a locked door). She has no problem shoving her personal life on tenants, including blaming her ill health on your cooking, having you intervene in her fights with religious institutions, rambling paranoia about the Chinese government, and telling tenants the neighbours are mad at them even if it isn't true.

He also would yell at my boyfriend and I on multiple occasions. He snipped our camera line. He would bring the ex landlord that sexually harassed me onto the property after knowing this and claims he wasn’t told. He also did nothing about the fire alarm that wasn’t working. He  made creepy sexual comments about a woman I knew. He also did not have common courtesy to let us know that people would be measuring the broken door in our house.

I spent a month repainting, refinishing the hardwood floors, replaced all the trim and had an electrician fix and replace the faulty (arcing in some cases) electrical outlets and switches.  

They never came to inspect the interior of the property for several years, including failing to inspect the fire alarms or co detectors.  

Eventually one of them came to check the detectors and was blown away at the quality of the home.  Said that the difference was remarkable!

That’s when the bogus and harassing LTB claims started coming in.  They also screamed at me in my front yard on a unannounced visit and accused me of “stealing electricity” because I plugged in a diesel truck for an hour on an extremely cold day. (No where in the rental agreement did it mention anything about how I could use electricity with the exception of window mounted AC units) 

I fought and won several times at the LTB because I had done nothing wrong.  Eventually, one Tribunal ruled against me not based on the facts of the case but the fact that I had been in front of the LTB so many times in quick succession…

Months and months go by with no repairs completed or even started. The only weathertight door to our apartment had a large hole in it that the previous tenant placed there to make it easier to serve her clientele.  Needless to say in Northern Ontario a big hole in your front door let's alot of freezing air in and alot of paid heat out.  Temporary fix was a wee bit of insulation and a cold air return vent you would see indoor for a heating system, on each side of the hole. When the warmer weather came request was submitted to replace the door. (Bylaw in our city stated this is a required item and is owners responsibility).  Response was he would get someone to install a door but we were responsible for purchasing it. - uh no. Many of the items that were noted in the tasks to do were actually bylaw infractions.  If i was smart i should have revealed to our city bylaw enforcement. Once i signed the eviction i was not able to submit the infractions as it would be taken as retaliatory. This inability for me to file complaint save hundreds of thousands of $ for him. 
Lets just say the list of violations was lengthy. Communication-he his a downright bully. Has no problem talking down to you and mentioning he knows more as he had worked years in real estate.  It got to a point that i was required to attatch and highlight our provincial landlord and tenant act to any email i sent as he my ideas were simply pulled out of thin air.  No action and never appology when i was correct. Finally after numerous threats of eviction with no validity he came up with an eviction to move a family member into the unit.  That was his only legal route.  At this point I had enough and agreed.

He will enter your apartment without notice, he will damage your personal property, bully you, rennovict you, ignore bedbugs, do the worst renovations, refuse to investigate health and safety issues (many he cause with his piss poor renovations) gaslight you, let meth dealers take hold in your complex without a care, lie to you, break all of the tenants of the landlord tenant acts, and try to strong-arm you into a million things that are against your tenant rights. People get so overwhelmed by his bullshit that going to the landlord tenant board doesn’t even seem worthwhile. The landlord tenant office knows him. The bylaw officers know him. It wouldn’t surprise me if the police know him- because he is shady AF. If you have it in you to fight him, lord be with you. If you aren’t living this nightmare hell scape yet and only considering one of his properties, I implore you for your own sanity, DO NOT DO IT. He is the lowest of the low low low and you deserve better. A squished piece of sidewalk pizza deserves better.

Bitten by bed bugs beginning in November of 2022. It is now late April 2023, still not dealt with. 
Served arbitration papers on two separate occasions. First time landlord laughed and shook them in my face saying ""this makes me laugh."" Second time he rushed my suite door, violently pounded on it and threw the papers at me repeatedly saying how he'd like to ""beat the %@$# out of me."" 
Police have been called 4 times regarding this individual. Landlord snears at me and acts intimidatingly at every opportunity. Scared my 12 year old daughter so badly she is reluctant to live with me anymore. Landlord saw me leaving for vacation. The same day he slipped a notice of access paper under my door and entered the next day without my knowledge or permission. Returned to find $460.60 missing from my suite.

Steps are sinking, walls separating from base boards, huge cracks in walls, basements leak, illegal outside doors that are meant for interior, my list is extremely extensive also windows that don’t lock or close. I had windows that leaked for 7 years I lived there and they’re remedy was to flip the window panes around to fit better. I had to seal off the window completely to stop the wind,rain, snow etc from coming in…still to this day not fixed! Lmao it leaks worse. But they just like to put lipstick on a pig instead. Right?

Between multiple news reports for renovation  evictions, to how standards are kept. 
Bedford does a once over pretting up the Properties they buy by glueing cheap vynal flooring, a coat of paint, and ""new"" appliances.  
Their maintenance is sub par to say the least as they have no care for the tenants, expect high rent for Cookie Cut Properties, long wait times for necessary repairs, and if that door doesn't shut properly its okay we wont fix it anyways. 
Amenities included are
 basement apartments- nightly floor sweats *so dont keep anything that might get wet there*, bugs, no soundproofing for that upstairs neighbor, extra fees for parking *60$ keys*25$ unknowingly sharing your neighbors hydro bill and more! 
Second floor and up- experience state of the art sinking balconies. That curve is no structural damage they were just updated in the 90s! Don't worry about the glue seeping through the floor boards, or that any appliance isn't properly mounted to counters just enjoy that they look nice! 
Every apartment has new and improved water savers that will give you a dripping shower worse than a gutter spout in the rain! 
We assure you this was done as fast as possible with all the corners cut! -literally idk where he tossed those things... 
Parking- when it snows we do 1 straight line down the center of the lot and expect you to care for your spot, but since your paying for it understand only cars go into it, no motorcycles, ebikes, big trucks, etc.
Theres no cameras so that we can keep the cost of parking low, after all we did just paint it.

Soon after I moved in, I complained routinely about major big pests.  Occasionally after months of delay and after calling 311 it was looked into but he refused to spend proper money to solve the issue once and for all.  Major pest problem went on for five years and was never solved.  I literally thought about suicide weekly and my physical health took a huge nosedive which I have never recovered from.

311 never did anything.  I believed he paid off the swarmy city inspectors who would visit and literally look at me like I was the cockroach.  Vile corrupt careerists.

He bullied me into a lease weeks before I wanted it, but I blame myself for not walking away at that point.  I let him take advantage of my desperation not to be homeless.

He would slap illegal eviction notices on people's doors just to enjoy the look of terror on tenant's faces.  He did it knowing full well the LTB would toss these notices out.  He enjoys inflicting misery.

He underpays his staff and overworks them.  If they dare to complain he fires them without even trying to negotiate for ten seconds.  He's a shark who can't pass by a coin lying on the street.  He lives in a mansion worth $10 plus million but he will take you to LTB court for $43.

Some buildings have the triple whammy of roaches, bedbugs AND mice.  Repairs are done by the cheapest contractor and you'll wait months for them to be done.  You can expect a rent increase every year although the standards for maintenance are slipping.  Hires staff but does not check references so you have no idea who is in your unit.  Always make sure you are home if access is required to your apartment. Would not consider any of these properties safe for women as superintendents tend to be misogynistic bullies Staff turnover including property management like you change your underwear:  frequently.   The only way to get things done when it comes to building standards is to call by-law to issue a mandate.  Your notices from access arrangements to rent increases are never in an envelope so everyone knows what their neighbour is paying for rent and in a rent controlled building it varies wildly.

The illegal basement apartment was completely full of black mold after some time with no idea why or how it started. The family members living down there had to move upstairs with us. The deck was also literally falling apart due to the fact that they didn't treat the wood when they built it so the weather changes over time caused it to decay. There were multiple holes that were about a foot long that they refused to fix. They were also supposed to and agreed to give us our deposit back after we handed our keys over, but never gave us anything and blatantly refused to.

 Everything is a 1 but if I could say zero and have his license revoked as a ranking I would. 1. He illegally came into the home and put a lock box onto the thermostat.
2. Mice!!!!! Mice mice and did I say mice! He refused to hire the terminator to get rid of these pests. There were large holes underneath the footsteps, getting through the garage, and the backyard
3. There was a horrible leak in the roof. He only started to do something about it after there was a compliance letter from the Brampton town. 
4. FIRE SPARKED! Underneath the sink we have sparks and smoke flying because it was a circuit away from starting a fire. The fire department had to come. This landlord left a live wire exposed underneath the sink where a dishwasher used to be. He then tried to accuse us of putting a dishwasher there and then blamed our cats chewing on it. They would’ve been fried and dead. 
5. He would unlock the door and come into the house with an improper notice. (Sent a 3 am notice)
6. Would bring his dog without a leash or muzzle which is illegal in Ontario because his dog is a pit bull and around knowing we had small children.
7. Turned off the hot water and has turned off the electricity on us
8. The washer and dryer broke the first year and he never replaced it
9. We cleaned the backyard cause he refused to do it. 
10. Tried these long notices from 12 to 9 and then try to linger for as long as he can
11. End of the year contract instead month to month he threatened for a new contract for in crease from 2900 to 3600$ and another first and last months rent. Then harassed until we went to court and he lost both L1 & L2.
12. Brings strange people around the house. A worker went into the backyard and tried to break the window to the basement because I refused him inside the house. He thought I was a women home alone and tried to scare me. Husband was home.
13. Would go into our closets and cupboards and tried to take pictures of our belongings
14. He parked his car in the garage and he does not live at the house. Lied to the basement people telling them it is our car. 
15 1 am in the morning I caught him in the window with his phone and flash looking side my home. Several times he would stare at me from the outside looking inside.
16. Uses his body to push through his way through the door.
17. He does 24 hour notices EVERY SINGLE DAY
- Had to get a cease and desist
- Had to get a lawyer
- He purposely makes it difficult to live in the house 
- His one intention is to kick people out once every year so he can raise the rent to the market value. Plus greedy wanting more on top of it.
He tried to use dependants under the age of 16 as his reason to kick us out

Wanted to restrict any visitors to the house and would tell us he has friends around here to watch his tenants

He does not care about safety health
Invasive and very scary behaviour. I do not recommend ANYONE ESPECIALLY A SINGLE MOTHER THERE.

Basement is an illegal unit that he is renting out to people. It is a fire hazard in the basement. Fire department also clarified it

So while at church they help the homeless, in reality their goal is to make people homeless for their own personal gain.

 They are the definition of slumlords who threaten their tenants because they believe they are smarter and can trick them into agreeing to illegal notices.  No consideration for people's time, proper notice of entry, or any form of personal respect.  

He is an ex addict with an anger management problem who threatens women and uses his new ""faith in God"" to pretend he has changed and turned into a decent person.  We moved out because I did not feel safe being home alone with my young child with the landlord on the property.  He is condescending and threatening towards women and his wife enables his abhorrent behaviour, because they know that the rental market is insane and most people can be threatened and silenced into condoning their behaviour with the threat of eviction as they have nowhere to go.",3,1,1,1,1

4929,FJM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K2P 0G7,CA,"I've lived in a unit for over two years now and overall it has been a decent experience in terms of landlords. Most maintenance requests have been handled within 24-48h and I feel safe in my building, love my building mates, and rent is affordable.

Notably when I moved in the apartment had not been given any care after the previous tenant left meaning there were many dents and chips out of the paint and drywall from millimeter ones up to about 6cm across. Often maintenance is done as a quick ""patch job"" as opposed to properly repairing things (eg calking tiles back together instead of fixing grout).

There have been a few incidents of maintenance requests taking far longer than they should considering the risk involved (ice left on steps for 4 days and having to advocate strongly for specific maintenance during COVID - the latter might have been a failure of management to understand the risk/benefit and their obligations to avoid non-essential work in units).

People consistently smoke at the entrances, on balconies, and in apartments despite the buildings being called ""smoke free."" Landlord's efforts to dissuade this have been marginally successful. Laundry is not available in all buildings, is expensive, and not particularly user friendly (one small washer and dryer together meaning multiple trips).",1,3,5,5,5

My unit was 'newly' renovated prior to moving in, it looked great but it had a lot of issues. Electrical in the entire apartment was completely messed up. At one point my fridge completely stopped cooling. It took almost 4 months before it was repaired. We had issues with the toilet, the oven, the lights, the washing machine.. The ONLY time they came and repaired any of the ongoing issues in the apartment was when they were putting the building up for sale. They got those issues figured out almost immediately.

The contractor was still working on renovating the bathroom and said it would be finished prior to us moving in, almost 2 months goes by before we moved in and upon move in date the washroom wasn't even usable, there was mold all over the ceiling and stuff left from the contractor all over the floor, nothing was touched, the entire back half of the house from the day we had went for the viewing. We called the office to get some sort of an answer as to what that was about and nothing took them 3 days to get back to us and said the contractor was needed at other properties,  we explained that the washroom wasn't even usable and that there wasn't even a washer and dryer like they said, they told us to use downstairs facilities till the contractor had time to finish, now a month goes by nothing from either and then one day after work I come home to the door to down stairs screwed shut which was where our only washroom was at the time, the door knob to the garage busted off and no notice of anything, turns out the property manager came over and didn't have keys to come in didn't give notice but felt it was okay to come in and damage the property, my partner tried to call the property manager no answer then we received a text that he admitted to coming in.

Upon move in day, the entire place was trashed, old furniture and food in the fridge. Dirt and sand all over the floors.  The house had rats, mice, ants and moles. We demanded they send someone to clean, and she agreed. They hired a lady to clean the floors and that's it. There was grease up and down all of the walls in the kitchen we had to clean ourselves.

4963,KARL FORD,OYSTER BED BRIDGE,PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND,C1E 0M2,CA,"His own cousin would rather be homeless than rent from him - that says it all.

Maintenance - what's that? I used to get stuck in the driveway because it was rarely ploughed and not once in 3 years was there salt or sand applied.

But by far the worst, he (illegally under the PEI Residential Rental Act) tried several attempts to evict me for the purposes of illegally raising the rent beyond what was regulated (as rental rates are in PEI). He eventually settled in a ""landlord take over"" of my unit, despite there being other units that were vacant and larger.

As it turns out, he was building a new mansion, and only intended to use my unit for 1-2 months. That is a short term rental not a ""move in."" 

So he has a negative reputation in the community (and among family), exercises dubious and bad-faith business practices, and typically rents to immigrants who pack 7+ people into a 2BR unit. 

He also ""didn't know"" that he had to return my damage deposit (as my unit was pristine when I left) PLUS interest for several years. He's a ""professional"" landlord with multiple multi-unit buildings so he's apparently stolen the interest of every tenant's damage deposit for uncounted years.

Follow his cousin's lead and avoid at all costs because your tenancy will be insecure and you will be evicted for dubious reasons (which he's notorious for doing).",1,2,1,2,1

We had recordings, we had paper trails, we had proof and this landlord did nothing about it. During the harassment, the landlord attempted to evict us 3 more times, all illegally. The landlord also revoked the backyard amenities when the neighbours moved in and offered to pay for exclusive use. Tom Rosa tried to get my partner in trouble at work using his position in the same company as part of their tactics to get us out. When they finally realized they couldn’t pull a fast one on us and the scam artist was charged leading to a quick midnight move leaving them high and dry, they sold the house but not before trying to illegally evict us during the process by claiming the house was already purchased and had to be empty for the new owner, the realty company said otherwise and then suddenly we were kept out of the loop entirely.

4991,RITA AND LARRY FROM GRAND RIVER PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,KITCHENER,ONTARIO,N2B1N3,CA,"Horrible landlords. The property management is also horrible. They never answer your calls ever. They only returned my call when I  threatened to file harrassment charges on my spying landlords. At first I thought my landlords were ok. Minus them talking trash about people in my building. This all started when I was dating a guy and we broke up and I had given him keys to my apartment. He refused to give them back and for my safety as we didn't have a lock on the building at the time I called them to see of they could change the locks. They came over and gave me so much attitude about it. Saying I'm not allowed to give ANYONE a key. I live alone and have no family and have 2 pets. If something happens to me then someone will be getting a key(atm haven't given anyone a key though for the past 3 years since this happened as I have trust issues now) one day in April 2021 I was waiting in my lobby for my Uber eats.we have a lock on our lobby door so that no 1 can even get into the building. Larry the male landlord was in our building(3 story walk up) I'm waiting down on the first floor. I'm waiting about 5 minutes. During this time the whole time he waited outside in the hallway spying on and listening to me and my transaction(receiving the food) as I'm going up to my apartment on the second floor I finally hear him go inside the third floor area(the hallway is small and u can hear everything) when I got back I'm livid. So half an hour after this occurred I called them to tell them my disgust on them spying on me. I told them I don't appreciate it. My landlord rudely retorts that is what happens when u are a drug addict and drunk. I'm disabled(Take prescription meds so if u are looking through the garbage you are a creep) secondly I work in a Brewery. I get free alcohol. And I don't even take my meds if I drink. I don't take my recycling out every week I take it out when my large bin gets full. Last I checked though prescription meds aren't illegal and neither is drinking. Even if I did weed (I didn't then, I take CBD now with a bit of thc for pain) that was legal since 2015. I moved in 2016, and this happened in 2021. I was so angry I called the property management several times(3 total) and left 2 messages about this and the last 1 threatening to file a harrassment charge on them. Only then did she call me back. (Grand River Property management) She came to take down a statement from them first and a day later me. I know because I saw her the day before with them outside. Doubt anything got done. She never said anything back so I again called her repeatedly and asked on a voice-mail what was being done. I got crickets. No response. Left a message to call me back. Last time i called and left a message demanding to know what she was going to do about this. She tells me she told them not to talk to me and advised me not to either. Like I have to when things need to be repaired. We have a note we fill out and they bring in amateur people to fix things 90% of the time. 
To note our building was built in 1964. I needed that info to set up my Hydro. Which my landlords told me. So our buildings electricity is always going out. Mostly in the summer, the dryer in basement trips out all the time, and the kitchen outlet I've had problems with since I moved in. So I called the fire department because I feared for my safety and cats when I work 12 hour shifts(ya still working disabled) he asked me to ask how old the building was. So I called them to inquire. Because I wasn't sure if it was 1962 or 1964. So Larry answers the phone again and denies he knows the answer to this. They have been living here years mind u(people setting up Hydro need to know that information) he tells me he doesn't know. I tell him well u had to give me that information when I moved in to set up Hydro so u do know. He starts yelling at me I'm wrong and he doesn't know. At this point I've had it with this jerk. I yell back u do know, and who's on drugs now?! And hung up on him. Fire department comes over and talks to landlords. He sent me an email telling me he told them they need to fix any issues that are a fire hazard. So I write out this page of 5 issues with 5 separate issues with different electrical issues. My kitchen outlet, my power always tripping out, the dryer tripping out in basement and the lights in the hallways always out so it's dark(I work nights and come home in the dark and sometimes leave in the dark depending on time change) he sets up an appointment with an electrician and I've had it with him. I decide to video him while he and this guy are in my apartment. I tell the electrician about all the issues and the guy says I'm just here to fix the kitchen outlet. I say but there is all these other issues and he says u need to talk to him(Larry who was standing in the kitchen with him) and I said I would but the last time I talked to him I got yelled at. The electrician sees my phone and asks are u recording me? I say im recording him being in my apartment as is my right(my property and i consent as I'm in the video and narrarated a few parts of the interaction. He doesn't say anything else about it. During this time Larry doesn't say a peep. Trying to be nice as pie in front of this guy. If I was alone he would have said stuff I know him. As they walk put the hallway i can hear them talking trash about me recording and i hear Larry say ya shes like that. Lol. I wonder why. I have to know protect myself. In case i need to go to court for these jerks. I've been here just over 7 years. So late last year they started fixing up the building. They put on a new roof, touched up paint in our apartments, put in brand new mailboxes, fixed the lights the ones in the front and back that go out every 2 months(no joke, the electrical is bad) they finally got brighter ones. Come to find put a tenant made a complaint about it being dark which is not allowed by landlord and tenant laws. I figure at this time they are fixing to sell the place. So anyways talking to a neighbor he is suing them. They took out the lights in the garages a couple select people have(12 garages and landlords own 4 for whatever reason. There are 22 units in both buildings combined.)anyways this tenant had heart failure. He was on the ground and thankfully someone taking garbage out found him in the dark. He also has black mold in his apartment they refuse to fix and they took away his stove and refuse to replace it. So he is suing them for the mold and almost killing him from lack of light in his garage. No 1 would have seen him and he could have died. He spent 9 days in the hospital and got a larger heart monitor put in from this accident. They tried to kick him out for them getting a negligent plumber in that didn't seal the sink in his apartment so it ended up flooding the downstairs apartment and they tried to say he owed over $1000 for water damage and if he didn't pay they would kick him out. Eviction. They gave him an N5 or whatever paper. That was last year. Clearly they don't have proof it was his fault and haven't pursued the eviction letter they sent. (N5 I think, I seen the paper and read it today) probably why they want to sell. Most of us are long term tenants some 20+ years. And are paying below market rent and they are getting sued for thousands of $ from this guy. They were sued before from a girl who slipped and fell. Also on that note 2 people slipped and fell within 24 hours because our landlord refused to salt the entry way. His wife ended up in the hospital as did another tenant in the basement. This happened this year a few months ago. Maybe February or March. Both had an ambulance. They are the negligent 1's, won't replace stoves which is against the tenant rights they MUST replace them, won't fix electrical that has high probability to start fires(which they would probably try to blame on us. Sorry Larry I have proof. I took pictures of the letter and time stamps of when I asked to get these issues fixed and u stood there and said nothing while the electrician said he was only there for 1 reason only) accuse people of being on drugs and alcohol without knowing the truth, are rude, abusive, gossiping about other people and harassing. I kinda do hope we get new management, and hopefully new landlords. These ones are probably early 70 to late 70's and are bitter people. Grand River Property Management Inc. Is useless also.

5000,CAPRIET,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4K 1V3,CA,"I absolutely love the building I live in because of the people and location, however Capreit is not a great landlord. The lack of communication with tenants is terrible. Repairs take a long time, and when they are completed (by the cheapest contractors they can find) they aren't done properly. Often things need to be repaired again. There has been a lot of problems with maintaining staff in the office so they keep on having to redo things like locker or parking spot inventory because the person who did it before didn't keep it in a place where the next person can see it. It's not the end of the world, but it certainly cause inconvenience to tenants who have to keep filling out forms over and over.  There has also been a lack of common sense and competency when it comes to knowledge about repairs and the order in which things need to happen. They are consistently doing unnecessary cosmetic renovations like changing the furniture in the lobby or the office, or painting the walls, or updating the lights in the pool, but don't do the things that are really necessary like repairing a sauna that hasn't worked properly in decades, or reducing potential for mould by clearing water out of storage areas every time it rains, or fixing issues in tenants units in a timely manner. They also are as often as possible doing above guideline increases, and will fight property tax rent decreases from the city every single time. I mean from a business perspective it makes sense for them, but from a human rights perspective it's terrible! This February they reported a record 24.3 per cent average rent increase on turnover (increasing rent for the next tenant, after the previous individual moves out.) So if they take a really long time to do mediocre at best repairs, of course tenants are going to want to move out, which then allows them to increase the rent, and by making things look pretty cosmetically they can ask for higher and higher rent for new people coming in.  All that being said, I do acknowledge it could be a lot worse, as I've seen in other places, but it could also be a lot better! I wish Capreit would remember that their actions or inactions affect the life, physical health, and mental health of their customers, and would treat us, and encourage their staff to treat us with respect and dignity.

He quoted me a price for the rental initially and when he realized it was incorrect, he said that he would honour it. His maintenance crew was quick and willing to come even on a public holiday.

He strikes me as a nickel and dime type of guy, having a coin laundry machine in the unit that barely works, not replacing the light bulb in the stairwell to the basement unit, having blinds for the room that are too small... he even tried to get us to pay a $50 fee for a twin mattress cover which costs at most $15 on Amazon... Also, for a guy who threatens to charge his tenants a cleaning fee if the house is not clean to his standards, there was a layer of dust on the furniture in my room when I moved in, I could not walk barefoot in the house the first day without getting my feet dirty, and the kitchen cupboards were not clean either.  He was also disrespectful toward my housemate, who was an international student from India, speaking to her with a rude tone and not following up on his word to provide furnishings for her room (he kept his word to myself and our other housemate-- both of us had parents involved in the rental process whereas she didn't).

They were told the pool was being removed from day 1 (it is still a bug infested emptyish pool).  The parking lot was to be redone, again they were told this when they moved in.

When he was moving, the front entry was blocked off for repairs and it is still blocked - how will an emergency vehicle ever get to the building - shameful.

They will only do what the landlord say etc etc so they will say no to repairs unless you plan on paying them for it. Again they expect the tenants to do yard maintenance and snow as well.

They let me know that they would be back at the end of the summer to collect their stuff which was fine. Near the end of the summer the tenants told me that they would not be returning so Lida told me that I would be responsible to clean up and clear out all the belonging of the other tenants. I told her that it is not my job to clean up other peoples mess which she didnt seem to understand. One morning the owners of the house came into my apartment with zero notice and told me that I have to clean up the apartment. So unprofessional. The dryer also stopped working after a week or so of moving in. It was never fixed so I had to go to the laundromat. After moving out I emailed Lida to get a rent receipt for my taxes and she totally ghosted me. If you want a good experiance in a landlord please go far far away from Lida at REMAX,1,1,1,1,1

They made a giant fuss about a medical cannabis grow in the basement, which had a fully isolated environment.   These are legal under the ACMPR, providing the person it's designated for is also tending the garden.  They tried to argue using an outdated 1996 law, that doesn't apply and is fully superseded by the ACMPR.  This led to try to evict my family, and the stress and headache inducing nature of the ordeal caused me to move the garden.

They accused us of modifying the electrical panel, and making ""unsafe"" modifications to the house, neither of which we did. 

They gave us a large rent increase of ~14%, moving the rent from 2100 / month to 2400 / month.  After raising the rent they rapidly tried to perform a bad eviction on us, and refused to offer up any evidence of their endgame, which caused legal problems, resulting in us being unable to move.

When we were finally able to move, they wanted us to paint the walls, replace the carpet, replace counter tops, they essentially wanted a full house renovation.  

One time I was unable to be home well they wanted to ""inspect"" the property, my partner was there, they belittled and degraded her the entire time.

They refused to put any money into the house, so any minor interaction with most of the interior left smudging, staining, and marks. 

Would I rent from them again?  No!

5094,WAYNE AND LINDA WATT,SOUTH PORCUPINE,ONTARIO,P0N1H0,CA,"Initially thought they were personable and friendly when I first met them. As our tenancy went on, they evolved to become very intrusive and abrasive. We kept them informed about any issues that arose, as there were a few that would adversely impact their property value/cost a lot of money in the long run if left without intervention. They were quite hostile to us informing them about issues and acted like they were doing us a favour by fixing it. They lived around the corner, so repairs were pretty quick, though fixes were often “half-assed” and ineffective. They did seem to care about safety, as they did conduct a number of inspections throughout our year long lease, though they abuse the 24hr inspection rules and conducted numerous inspections over a 4 month span, that definitely could have been completed in  1 or 2 visits. The inspections felt intrusive rather than practical, couldn’t help but feel like they were trying to catch us doing something that they could berate us for. Smoke detectors all worked, we purchased our own carbon monoxide alarm because the ones they provided were ceiling mounted. We observed that they drove past the house frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, and our neighbours informed us that they saw them trying to peek into our windows on numerous occasions. The next door neighbour informed us that the wife was bragging to him about entering the unit without our knowledge or consent. We had hoped to live there long term, as it was a nice and spacious apartment listed for a reasonable price. Unfortunately living there was not worth the reasonable rental prices as the landlords were intrusive, disrespectful and abrasive. There were a few uncomfortable situations, but there was one in particular where the landlords screamed at me in the front yard for all the neighbours to hear when I responded to their question with an answer they were unhappy with, it was embarrassing and made me cry. I no longer felt safe in the dwelling and we moved out as soon as our one year lease was up. After we had moved out, we learned that some of the neighbours had taken bets on how long we “the new couple”  would last in the apartment, because the units have a history of being a revolving door of short tenancies due to the disrespectful and unreasonable nature of the landlords. I wish I had known that before signing the lease! Ultimately it is a nice and spacious apartment in a decent location for a below market price, the unit was clean and there were no issues with mold or pests (aside from the landlords themselves).

They will also raise your rent (within the bounds of the law) yearly.  They definitely overcharge based on how hot the market is.  
In the context of Longwood Apartments, the new superintendent is trying to catch up with years of disrepair in this building, so repair can often be slow or left incomplete.  However, the new superintendent keeps the building very clean and is very responsive to questions.  There are no issues with bugs or rodents of any kind (to my knowledge).  The building is quite old though - so while this means the rooms are better insulated than newer buildings, it also means that there are no anti-scald valves on the showers so they are prone to scalding you (on the bright side, there is always hot water).  The building is hot-water heated, so you cannot control the temperature of your apartment.  It can get very hot in the winter, and there is no air conditioning in the summer (no window AC units are allowed, but you can use other forms of AC).

5108,ALEJANDRO (ALEX) VELASQUEZ,AIRDRIE,ALBERTA,T4A2V9,CA,"Where do I start. This landlord was the worst landlord my husband and I (or I) have ever dealt with. I have never had an issue with any landlord, until this one. 
When we found this location we all discussed and agreed on what would be paid and by who. It was a farm. We actually came to find out in the middle of our term that we were paying for electricity and to heat a shop on the property that was rented to someone else for storage, in which the landlord was also getting paid for already. When we mentioned this, as we were told the shop had no heat or power, he stated ”if we didn’t like it we were free to leave”.
Our clothes dryer stopped working in January, and when communicated to him it took over three weeks to get a response after continuous emails. In this case, we were just going to buy one and decrease it from rent which is what actually ended up happening. We picked up and installed it ourselves and disposed of the not working one. 
On signing of the lease, we agreed on $2000 for rent if his mother lived in the basement in her own suite, or $2500 for rent if we had the entire place to ourselves. We were okay with $2000 and letting his mother live there. Then a year later, he raised rent to $2200. So at this point we might as well have asked her to leave and rent the entire place for $300 more. Which at this point now was not an option. Which was also in the middle of Covid and housing was impossible to find. His mother was extremely loud, and blasted Spanish gospel music very early mornings on weekends. 

His mothers dog started coming to our side and randomly attacking our dog, which was a puppy, even when he was tied and on our side of the property. They refused to contain their dog, and on one occasion the landlord actually had to lay down and physically restrain his dog from attacking ours which was never communicated to us but we did both witness this through window. 

The landlord was always visiting the house. Which was understandable because his mother lived there, but also left no sense of privacy for us at all. 

The property in which he told us was very private actually had multiple people coming and going every day at all hours, using our property for storage and actually parking their vehicles and equipment on our area. 
My husband and I spent a lot of time fixing up this place and keeping it clean and tidy, just to watch the landlords visitors throw garbage and drop nails around, as well as his mother would dump garbage everywhere she could. 

Alex decided to move his brother also in with his mom for a few months, yet did not communicate any changes of utilities to us, and even lied about someone else staying there. I was working from home at this point so it was very obvious someone was staying below us while his mother was gone - You could see a vehicle and hear someone. 

Upon leaving this place as our lease was terminated due to both sides not wanting to renew due to all these issues, the landlord told us he was going to withhold our damage deposit even though the house was left in pristine condition as well as we took pictures to prove before we physically left for good. Because we knew that he was going to do this, we did not pay rent for the 12 days we stayed into that month that we were to leave at the end of, so Alex had his mom stay at his house for a couple days and cut off all power and heat and water to us in April, when the weather was still freezing.
Let’s just say, we are now in a new spot  and Landlord is amazing - We just signed on for a second year after being told we can stay as long as we want. Complete change from worst to best. I wish this website was here a long time ago.",1,1,1,1,1

No notice before staring construction either. Tried to tell me to move at the end of the month right after asking me to pay $250 more a month. Harassed me, broke in to the unit late at night despite my saying no they could not enter at that time and to come back in the morning. Lied about reason stating “emergency” but it was actually to test water lines for the second basement apartment that were put in that day. Never gave 24 hours notice even after reminding numerous times that they were required to. Got to the point that they would literally just open the connecting door and come in to the unit without any notice or even courtesy to wait for the door to be answered. This was a bachelor basement unit - I could have been naked when they walked in! Furnace was broken for several months. It was 30 degrees most days all summer and then single digits come fall when they finally had it repaired. I never asked for other repairs so can’t say how they are with that. Only wanted to be paid in cash as they said they don’t want to pay tax on the money. Refused to provide a lease - make sure you know about the Ontario Standard Lease. Have no respect for tenants rights. Only nice while they are happy to take your money and then quickly become mean and harassing when they have collected enough from you. Unit is also not up to code as confirmed by a contractor I know and trust. The second basement apartment they were adding is also not legal and there’s no permit or inspection from the city on record. Electrical issues in the house that could be possible fire hazard. Various electricians came to check issues not sure if they ever fixed but definitely seemed sketchy. They will enter your unit for this as breakers are in the bachelor unit.

This is already more than twice the recommended increase and as I previously mentioned, they haven’t even bothered to try to help with the mold issue. They haven’t made any changes/updates to the building, they’re literally just greedy and trying to suck more money out of the tenants in the building (I’ve talked to 6 others in the building who said they’re also refusing the raise because the landlord doesn’t do anything worth a raise in rent).

Tenant Privacy Rating: I haven’t experienced any issues with regards to privacy, but leaving the rating at 3 because I still don’t trust the landlord judging by how they act in regards to issues and are very rude in general (related to next point).

Respect Rating: extremely disrespectful, will get angry at you and try to blame you for issues that are building issues, such as the mold I have in my apartment due to terrible insulation.

The managers are dismissive, intrusive, forgetful, give huge lectures over things that were done by other tenants, they gaslight ( the washing machines kept breaking down and the managers kept saying that people were overloading them, however, one load of laundry was taking two to three loads to wash. Eventually they had to replace the washers and we could return to doing regular sized loads. However during the years in which the washers weren't working properly it would cost almost $12 to do a single load of laundry given that you had to disperse it amongst three loads in order to prevent the machines from breaking down.) Both of the managers have been known to get aggressive and have blocked guests from entering the building or interrogated them as they entered. The bare minimum was always what could be expected when a repair was done. If it wasn't something that was like a broken pipe, the repair would not get done. Yet they would complain consistently that tenants never told them about damage to the apartment until they moved out. They constantly complained to tenants about other tenants. There was very little privacy. You couldn't Trust them to keep their mouth shut about anything and their non-stop complaining about other people was exhausting. Tenants are often sneaking in and out of the apartment building in order to avoid having to talk to the managers, as they live in the building as well.

As a current tenant, I can attest that the shared areas of the condominium are consistently dirty and never properly cleaned. It's clear that the landlord is neglecting their responsibility to maintain a clean and safe living environment for their tenants.

In addition, the landlord has failed to renew any of the units in the building, which has resulted in numerous problems for me as a tenant. My unit is outdated and poorly maintained, and I've had to deal with several issues related to plumbing, electricity, and heating/cooling. When I've brought these issues to the landlord's attention, they've been slow to respond and often provide band-aid solutions rather than addressing the root cause of the problem.

Finally, the repair and maintenance procedures in this complex are simply terrible. The landlord seems to have no interest in investing in quality repairs or maintenance, and as a result, tenants are left to deal with ongoing problems that could easily be prevented with proper care.

Ignore maintenance or repair requests. Do not appropriately deal with tenants that harrass and threaten other tenants. Speak to tenants in a condescending way. Try to blame tenant for anything that breaks or things that are completely out of tenants control. They do less than the bare minimum. Absolute slumlords. They are a father daughter duo and they both need an attitude adjustment. His daughter Ashley is a brat and literally every other tenant I've talked to feels the same way.  Disgusting.,1,1,1,1,1

The woman managing is the wife to one of the owners (Hedy Dobson) and is a complete cunt of a woman who thinks she’s better than everyone else. These owners took years to get to repairs in our apartment that were costing us money. We had horrible cracks in windows that were allowing heat to escape for two winters in a row. When our hot water stopped working we’re pretty sure they just connected our hot water to the tank for the apartment next door, as we couldn’t even take a full shower or do a load of dishes without running out of hot water. She would make up arbitrary rules whenever she felt like it with no written agreement, but those rules never applied to her random friends renting out other units. Whenever something needed to be done, they’d give absolutely no notice, then blame us for either not being home or not answering the door. She once called me 3 times, left 3 voicemails telling me she’s pounding on our door, and text me 5 times in the span of an hour while I was at work because we parked our car where they told us to, but in that moment was in the way due to an order for their store downstairs (we had just bought a new one, and we’re in the process of selling this one), and when I told her she can’t do that, that’s harassment to spam call me and randomly pounding my at our door, since this is a non-emergency. Her response was “well then you’re getting an eviction notice on Monday”. She then gave us an illegal and invalid final notice to vacate after we gave her a notice of complaint for harassment. They tried to get rid of us after we’d been living in this apartment for several years, years before they even bought it. These people don’t do leases, and everything is cash under the table, I’m assuming for tax evading purposes. When they were told to keep our damage deposit (the place was damage-free) instead of last month’s rent they tried to send a debt collector after me so they could keep both damage deposit and last month’s. Doesn’t really work when you don’t do leases or paper trails",1,1,1,1,1

They used the back of the building lot as a garbage dump.  Getting things repaired was a nightmare. Incredibly rude when you bring to their attention they ar emote providing services theybar elegantly required to.  Such as, clearing snow for a paid parking spot/lot.  I had to shovel out the parking area several times just to get to work.  When I complied thatbtheybar eneglecting to clear the snow and are required to as they charge for parking, I was treated with taking my parking away from me.  They don't like to turn on the heat when winter comes.  Had a new born  and an apartment that was 18 degrees Celsius with the sun beaming in.  Rude, incompetent and vindictive.  After I reported them to the city, and were given 2 weeks to make the building safe and acceptable for rental, they raise day rent as much as the legally could.  The only good thing that came of renting from them is it was such a horrid experience I decided to meet with a mortgage broker and see if I can afford to buy a house.

The neighbour was involved in criminal activity with police showing up weekly and never did anything. My hydro bill had gone up to 400$ a month for a very tiny 2 bedroom, I suspected my landlord so falsely led him to believe that I would be having Toronto Hydro come to investigate, magically my hydro bill went down to under 150$ a month the next month. Found out from previous tenants that they use their tenants hydro to run their business that is downstairs. Refused to provide proper garbage cans, 3 apartments, 9 tenants total and we were told to share two small garbage bins and 1 recycling bin. In the middle of the pandemic I received a notice that we had to leave because of serious repairs needed, the roof caving in and a wall would have to be removed, in actuality no repairs were ever done(I kept a close eye on the building after as I suspected raising the rent was the real reason) and apartment went up for rent 1 month after I left for double the rent I had been paying.

If you ask to communicate over phone calls. He texts you. If you ask to communicate over email, he will text and call you non stop 30 times a day. It gets so bad you have to change your phone number. His favourite line is “it’s not about the money it’s about the respect” which we all have figured out it is about the money, he has a respect complex, probably stemming from childhood, where he was never respected. If you don’t do what he says he will make your life a living hell. He will call you names, call your children names and he will call your bluff and harass you to no end.

Pictures were taken long time ago and doesn't reflect the real situation. Have to pay extra for laundry and the machines are timed. There are many rules in the house but not strictly enforced. The landlord would assign cleaning and garbage-take-out duties to tenants but with no enforcement or any fairness. The quality of living really depends l on how responsible and clean your housemates are, since the landlord does not care or enforce the rules.

5194,HANLYN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,ONTARIO,L8M1P2,CA,"Recently moved from a long-term lease with a private slumlord to a new unit under Hanlyn - they had good reviews and feedback from current and former tenants online, as well as contractors that have done some work for them, so I specifically pursued finding a unit under their management, as finding a similarly reputable company in Hamilton proved impossible.  I did learn, upon move-in, that Hanlyn provides incentive to their tenants and contacts to leave positive reviews, however the incentive would certainly not be enough for me to keep quiet about any day-to-day issues if I were to have any, so I don't see this as particularly ""scammy"" - more like thanks for helping out with a little Tim's card.  Regardless, my experience from viewing the unit to signing to move-in and now active tenancy has been fantastic.  I'm a licensed paralegal and was very pleased to witness the company follow all legal procedure and requirements of the RTA throughout every phase of the process, including proper standard Ontario lease agreements with correct clauses in place, and RTA approved timeline commitments for various considerations.  They provide an online maintenance request portal where you can request urgent or non-urgent maintenance support in your unit - I have always had maintenance requests replied to within 2 hours tops during business hours, and I've never experienced more than a 48-hour turnaround to have maintenance out to my place for minor/non-urgent requests.  There is an afterhours line for urgent requests outside of business hours.  Any maintenance or fixtures I've requested have been completed very quickly and to my satisfaction.  The unit was extremely dirty upon move-in and hadn't had a thorough clean between tenants, however I acknowledge that it was being shown for upwards of 2 months and many people were in and out of the unit during that time.  I recently received notice of spring maintenance, and they came by to do a check of my smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, cleaned out dryer vents, and hooked up outdoor water supply.  They are thorough and seem to practice in compliance with RTA, and if I'm not in touch, they leave me alone.

Contrary to the Ontario LTB act, many tenants smoke in the building in addition to other unacceptable activities such as woodworking in the hallways, trash and unwanted items piling up in common areas and more. 
Herb has successfully evicted problem tenants in the past, only to replace them with new problemed renters, this is largely due to a lack of due diligence in the screening process.

He shared my personal contact (though not legally confidential) information to some of his other tenants without consent and not because of any sort of emergency.

He has harassed me for over two years now, calling me all sorts of names and cussing me out, he has gone tenant to tenant defaming my fiance and I, telling them we are scam artists, that we are criminals, and tried to gather all their signatures to try and use it against us when he served us a unauthorized bad faith N12 form. He also served us an N5 trying to claim the carpets were soaked in urine from our cats, and that we owed him $1,600. When I asked for the receipt from the company, he refused to give it to me.

Long story short,he begged us to withdraw our LTB claim in exchange of 2months free rent...we ended up negotiating 3 months, and  he wanted to split our storage fees and refused to accept full responsibility.

He calls the security guys shit skins because they are South Indian.
He calls the property manager Chinese mango because she is Asian. Someone else from the management company he calls tariyaki sauce be cause he is Japanese? This guy is short with a typical middle eastern nose and facial trait.
He tells everybody in our community center that he is the boss of the building. He offer 1 bachelor for 1 day at 50$. 150$ for the weekend. No lease no contract just cash money give to him.

 If you don't answer her texts within a few minutes she will continually text you, call you and even email you, whether you are at work or sleeping or even in a hospital, or even dealing with a death in the family according to her you should always answer her, in her opinion you should also be like best friends with her and text her every day.  And for repairs, be prepared to spend a whole day with her in your house because she refuses to hire a professional and doesn't know a thing about appliances or any other thing and will just keep doing things that seem like it's fixing it but it isn't, and also during that time her husband will sit in the backyard and do nothing & if you don't watch her she will go wondering into rooms for no reason.",1,2,2,1,1

There is on-site laundry that hasn't been repaired in at least 7 years so tenants are told to use the laundry across the road, which is actually decent but if you're going to tell people on-site laundry it should be available. All leaks in the apartment were met with a No Frills bag instead of being sealed or investigated. Upon moving into the apartment no cleaning was done and he tried to blame my roommates and I for the level of dirt despite photos from move in showing otherwise. When asked when our oven would be cleaned (as it was unusable upon move-in) he tried to bill my roommates and I for the cleaning. During the actual cleaning, he didn't know I was home, he was talking poorly about my roommates and I and threatened violence. The Bylaw officer in South Parkdale knows Edward and his various properties well.

She continued the work for MONTHS, all hours of the day, and on weekends. There was dust everywhere. It was incredibly troubling and we ended up taking her to court. It ruined our first rental experience, wholeheartedly. I couldn't believe this could be allowed. Not only to enter my home with no notice, but to essentially split my rental home into two.

No more than one pair of shoes in the main entrance, nothing on the landing going down to your unit (not even for a few hours), nothing on the porch, nothing outside your door. Cold, heartless glares from Marisa whenever crossing paths. Alyssa issued me FIVE eviction notices in the 13 months I was there and they were all thrown out when we got before the board with her having to pay me. During my prep for our trial I contacted the tenant prior to me who vouched for her insane behaviour and expectations of a tenant. This is clearly a pattern and they are not capable of cohabitating with anyone peacefully in that house. Not to mention the apartment is a shoebox with terrible temperature regulation - it’s either too hot or too cold, with minimal sunlight from a window under their deck.

5241,ADRIAN AND CRISTINA OF CELLUPICA INVESTMENTS,ST. CATHARINES,ONTARIO,L2P 2E5,CA,"These landlords care nothing about the tenants and solely about money. The apartment I rented from them looked “renovated” but was in fact barely holding together. The floors were peeling up, the windows (ones that actually opened) didn’t have proper handles, we had to use adjustable wrenches to turn the knobs. The biggest windows in the apartment didn’t open, were stuck shut completely. The ONLY AC unit in the apartment was very small and could not keep the entire unit cold. When I asked if I could install another window AC unit I was told no and to shut my blinds to keep the hot sun out (genius!). It was a 3 unit building, with 1 washer and dryer - that flooded the basement on MULTIPLE occasions. Meaning I’d have to take my kids and I laundry elsewhere to have clean clothing. They decided that the house didn’t need any grass, or any kind of yard and paved it. Great! The only problem is, it’s a 1 way in 1 way out space. A VERY narrow driveway. Getting a vehicle in and out of there was AWFUL. They expected 3 vehicles to park there when we struggled to put 2 cars side by side without hitting eachother.. want out of the driveway? 8 point turn. Make sure you don’t hit the broken, falling over fence that is covered in nails that stick out and will slice your hand - like it did my daughters. When you bring any issues to the attention of Adrian he will call you and belittle you. He will call you names, he will tell you how rich he is and how he doesn’t need to deal with any of this. When you bring anything to Cristina, she will talk to you like you’re below her. On multiple occasions, the tenants they moved in below us were extremely loud and disrespectful. When I reached out I was basically told it’s a shared building and to deal with it. 
And when I finally had enough and decided to move - Adrian said “good! Now I can raise the rent!”

He refused to maintain the building to health and safety standards even after the city's orders. 
He tried to trick us into leaving our lease early so he could raise the rent +$600. 
He illegally renovated (by himself) the other unit in the building from a single dwelling unit into an illegal 8+ person rooming house. The recantations were constant, all hours, and weekends. None of those tenants were on leases and all paid under the table illegally.
Levent was constantly on the property with no notice at all, letting himself into the building and using the backyard from morning until night.  Every single week our entire front yard was FILLED with his garbage. 
He constantly had screaming fights with a friend of his he let move into the building. 

Literally none of our appliances worked (fridge, washer/dryer, dishwasher) and he threatened to call the police on us when we requested repairs saying it ""wasn't his problem"" ""he doesn't understand the rules and we are racist for asking him to learn them""  and ""you're using them wrong"". 
When we reported a leak in our sink he told us we were being dramatic and he wouldn't help us. Then the leak spread through the house, into the downstairs unit, through light fixtures ripping through their ceiling, and into the basement. He then tried to frame us for insurance purposes so he would not be liable. 
When he came to the unit for our insurance information, I asked when he would be coming for repairs...He then called the police on my father an I (the police literally laughed at him and told him he has a legal responsibility to maintain the property.) 

After months of harassment and poor living conditions, we tried to bargain to leave our lease with one month notice but he refused unless we paid him more money. The day before our move out, he broke a window in another unit and tried to frame us for ""throwing a party"" and causing the damage. He called the police on me again when he saw our moving trucks and filmed me an inch from my face aggressively, threatening me again. In the end, the police were involved 3 times because of this unprofessional behaviour.

We did not have working blinds in our unit for the majority of 3-year stay, and there were issues identified at move-in that were simply never resolved (ie, no drawers in linen closet or kitchen pantry). Hydro in the building would be shut off at least a few times a month. 

Most importantly, when I moved out there was very little communication of how to arrange the elevator or when inspection would take place ""because move outs don't usually happen on weekends so there is no staff available to support"" (???). They then overcharged me another month of rent when we already moved out, and it took 3 months to receive my money back after weekly reminders and check-ins.

Once everything was dried and cleaned up they arranged for professional carpet cleaning and completely tore open the ceilings, let dry for a few days and replaced and even painted the room in my choice of colour (I did have to provide the paint as it was standard apt white). Given the size of my unit, the rent is reasonable; all inclusive and includes 2 parking spots.

When I moved out myself a neighbour recorded me taking my couch to the curb (for bulk garbage pickup) and emailed it to Pam who then called me and threatened me with calling by-law.

Cons: You pay a lot of money for “luxury” living and amenities, but management hires cheap external labor, and it shows. Painters do horrible jobs when preparing apartments before move in, with paint splatters everywhere that you have to take care of yourself. Gardeners routinely kill plants around property cause they never water the plants or take good care of landscape. Cleaners literally NEVER clean, so the hallway walls and floors and staircases look messy and dirty all the time (I’ve seen the hallways not be vacuumed for months, even when they’re really messy!)

I paid for the 3rd year, and 4th year to avoid conflict. Over the 5 years, whenever she came to town twice a year and stayed for 4-5 days, i had to sleep at a friend's place even though i paid rent, cos i could not switch on AC (Jul) and heater (Dec). She asked me to get a personal space heater, so i had to invest in one even though the apartment had heating and cooling included. She would use my utilities and leave the house a mess for me to clean asking me if i had a vacuum, as if i was her servant. I even had to pay cleaners to come in to do a deep clean in 2020/ 2021 during pandemic cos she would not maintain anything in the house cos she was not in town and all the previous tenants leftovers were everywhere. I did not know this at the time and assumed everything was hers. The whole responsibility was on me, even picking up her mail. 

In the fifth year she decides to raise rent again by a ridiculous amount, and i told her i'll confirm. Sent her the rent as usual and 3-4 weeks later before the next increased rent was due, she lands in Toronto from LA, whi8le i was at work and breaks into the house without giving me any verbal or written notice, takes off safety locks and asks me to leave the premise on the false note that i had not called her or picked her call.

The bathroom shower handle leaked and broke due to no maintenance, which even the plumber noted on his visit after much pleading. In spite of having kept the place immaculate in the 5 years, the day she broke in she said the place was a mess, that she felt threatened by me and that she wanted me out in 2 days.

Which we at the time thought was very odd, but continued to disregard cos she was never around for too long. She also claims to be a lawyer, but is no longer a practising one in Canada or the US.

It was unfortunate that i don't have the money to hire a lawyer to serve her, so i had to bite the bullet and move on. After much contemplation i also realized alot of red flags and that this was not her first time.

Drama!

When a problem arises in the home that is beyond your control and not your fault, Jennifer and Charity will blame you.  When you assert your rights, they become aggressive and tell you that you are breaching material terms of your tenancy agreement in an attempt to bully you into giving in to their demand.

My privacy was constantly invaded to the point where I felt uncomfortable leaving my apartment and there were countless times they broke landlord rules. 
The building is also poorly maintained. It reeks like cigarettes in the hallway and the spider webs are endless. They make small (landlord-special) upgrades, but you lose a privilege every time. For example, when they redid the parking lot they took away all visitor parking. The building is loud and not a great spot for middle-aged working professionals and the building security is lacking.

The daughter and him ended up having an affair because she would not leave him alone, encouraged him to abandon me where I was. She lied and stole from us and put my children in the midst of her scheme. They manipulated him and he felt pressured that if he did not go along with what she desired that they would use the house against him, which is ultimately what happened when I arrived back home sooner than uplanned.

Speaking of the bath, there was a hole in the wall near the bathtub full of black mold, and Maryann was told about it and was aware of it prior to me moving in but didn’t deal with it. They used the garage attached to the suite as personal storage, which was fine, but what wasn’t fine was they showed up multiple times a week to throw shit all over my front yard, and scared not only myself by showing up with no warning but also any guests I had. They also gave me a hard time for having a portable AC unit on during the day in the summer, saying I wasn’t allowed as per the lease but there was nothing in the lease indicating that. Regardless of how many utilities were used, i received an essay-style email almost every month lecturing me and the other tenants on the environmental impact of using utilities. Matthew had control of the thermostat via wifi (which, they had to hook up the thermostat to MY wifi when i moved in), and shut the furnace off during Christmas break because he “thought everyone left for Christmas”.

At that point another tenant said she had the spare key for that apartment as it was her friend's unit. They both lived alone and thought it be a good idea for each other to have the spare key. The door got unlocked and it turned out that the lady left a burner on and a dish towel was laying near by and started smoking.

Something like $1000!! It was normal wear. She did nothing in the 7 years we lived there! We never once paid our rent late, we were quiet and clean. She just had it out for us!!

The woman in their office (Roumi) speaks little English and has difficulty communicating with tenants verbally or in writing. Written notices are rude with garbled English. I sued them at the rental housing tribunal and the adjudicator reprimanded them for their abusive and threatening letters. They take every opportunity to snoop and spy on tenants to find excuses to evict us. They issue illegal entry notices, for example a notice that covers two or more days with no time of entry. They don't give 24 hours notice, they drop off notices as late as 6 pm for a 9 am entry the next day. They lie on entry notices about the reason for entry so they can snoop. If they do a big repair the owner sneaks into the apartment and rummages through the tenant's belongings. This man is verbally abusive and berates the tenant for having items he doesn't approve of. I'm disabled and he tried to force me to get rid of my walker. The building supposedly allows pets, but if they see cages or other signs of pets they call Ontario Animal Control and file false cruelty complaints to force the tenant to get rid of their pets. They try to bully and harass people to pay illegal fees, like $500 per air conditioner. They don't notify tenants about upcoming power or water shutoffs, all announcements are posted on the wall beside the elevators, so if you don't leave your apartment you don't get notified. My apartment is a slum. The kitchen cabinets have fallen off the walls twice and I had to nail them back up. The kitchen hasn't been renovated since the 1960's, the linoleum is almost worn through and the knobs on the cabinets are unsafe - I catch my fingers or my nails in them. There's no counter space and I have to use a kitchen cart. My fridge door is held on with duct tape. My stove drawer is broken open and from a different model of stove. Their cheap parquet wood floor tiles pop off from wear and tear and then they accuse the tenant of deliberately pouring water on them. If you ask for repairs they try to blame you and threaten to charge you and/or evict you. Same goes for bug spraying, I get three kinds of ants, spiders, flies, roaches and bedbugs. I have to seal food containers in Ziploc bags and keep them in the fridge or freezer. When I asked for spraying I was told I caused the bugs and would be billed for the exterminator. The real reason for the bugs is that my apartment is next to the garbage chute and they never spray or clean it.

Common spaces are brightly lit and cleaned regularly. Regular maintenance is done on the property (painting hallways, duct cleaning, parking lot repairs etc.). Landlord follows all rules about proper notice to enter units and increase rent (which they will do each year). 

My only complaint is the extensive application process. By far the most detailed application I've had to fill out when applying to rent somewhere. They will ask your bank to provide a statement on your banking history and average account balance. They also ask for your SIN - but you do not have to give it to be accepted as a tenant (I did not). When I rented, they asked me to sign a statement that it was a pet-free building and I would agree not to have any pets. This statement is contrary to Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act (landlords cannot prevent you from having pets once you live in the building, as long as these pets are not causing problems for other residents). In all fairness, despite having me sign this statement, Westdale does not even try to enforce these agreements.

They're very unprofessional , they're very well known for not fixing issues in their tenants apartments, forcing tenants out due to maintenance issues so they can renovate after their tenants have vacated their unit , so they can charge outlandish rent. Since my time here I've seen countless tenants move out ranging from mold, to plumbing, lack of heating in several units The property is unsafe due to the constant vagrants that come on the property either to shoot up their drugs or empty out the cigarette butt cans. Also if youre late on your rent they will to try and charge you late fees , which is illegal.The owner John Walter Jansesn is a pompous, rude and unpleasant to deal with.

For months he was trying to bully me out of my unit- either by raising the rent an insane amount, or with threats of me ""impersonating the owner"" when I needed to sign up my car for the new parking system in the building. He is extremely rude when he communicates with me. He has lied to me about needing the unit for his own family and saying I needed to move out.. TURNS OUT that after months of being threatened to move out, he wasn't paying his mortgage and the unit got rekeyed by a law firm. He is without a doubt the worst landlord I've ever had the displeasure of communicating with.

Oh PS, he has a criminal record with gun-related charges if you just google his name and Toronto News.

5431,TINA MARTINS / AF MARTINS,OTTAWA,ONTARIO,K1N 7S5,CA,"The units are fine, typical rental quality for the student-dense location. There are a ton of illegal clauses added to leases - i recommend that tenants read up on their rights as this landlord counts on tenants being young students unaware of their rights. Tread carefully if you want a good tenant landlord relationship - this landlord will act pleasant and professional, but the second you let on that you know your rights, ask reasonable questions or ask for them to fulfill their duties, she will flip a switch and become extremely disrespectful and volatile. Responsiveness is erratic - sometimes it is immediate and sometimes it takes several emails and calls over weeks. If you need repairs or anything, good luck. They will either not respond, try to suggest you fix the problem yourself with your own money, or try to blame and charge you for the fix. Also know that if she commits to something verbally, she knows better than to put it in writing and will lie later on - never give her the benefit of the doubt and try your best to get her to put things clearly in writing. No issues with invading privacy though. Biggest advice is know your rights and don’t be bullied into letting them neglect their responsibilities when they gaslit, blame or demean.",2,2,4,5,2
5432,CHARLIE R,BRAMPTON,ONTARIO,L6P 3H1,CA,"At first the place seemed fine but it wasn't long untill problems started. Charlie was fairly ok about replacing or fixing things (namely the power kept going out) but other things (washer/dryer) kept having issues that were never resolved. He had an issue with privacy & boundaries. I guess he figured because I was renting his bsmt, he could just show up & enter whenever he wanted. There was one time (early Saturday morning) when my daughter (a baby at the time) & I were sleeping. It took her ages to go to sleep so it was late when we finally fell asleep. I was woken up to a loud pounding at my door & my phone ringing. When I answer the phone, it was Charlie's wife calling to tell me that they had guys waiting outside to clean the ducts in the bsmt & that I had to let them in. There was no prior warning, heads up or anything. I had to wake my daughter up & then rush to get some clothes on. Charlie's wife showed the guys where the vents were & then just left the guys down there with us. 

After confronting Charlie about this incident, he blew up, got violent, started cursing obscenities at me saying I was being difficult & he's never had this problem with other tenants. This all happened because I simply asked for a little consideration in the future in terms of access to the unit. I explained that I get there's maintenance & such that has to be done but letting me know ahead of time is considerate among other things. It takes no effort to send a text message to let me know that they need to get into the bsmt for whatever. Apparently asking for a heads up was me being difficult. Charlie cursed at me again saying that I was costing him money & making the work take longer than necessary. There was another similar instance where another repair guy was supposed to show up & never did but apparently told Charlie at 9 something at night that he was still supposedly coming. I ended up sitting up till 10pm waiting with my daughter because Charlie said this guy was coming. When it hit 10:30pm & I told Charlie that my daughter & I needed to sleep, he again got irate saying I was costing him money & that he will have to reschedule for the repair guy to come again, etc...

For a bit after that, Charlie would send a text ahead of time for whatever but then he stopped. He & his wife went back to just showing up at my door. Another time I was working (I work from home) & with no warning, Charlie shows up with a whole crew of guys who start using power tools in the bsmt. I couldn't finish work & was forced to log out for the entire day. The guys seemed to think it was funny that I was there trying to work & I guess didn't realize that I would be in the unit in the first place. Another time, Charlie showed up with a city inspector to check the bsmt (apparently someone complained to the city about too many cars in the driveway), the inspector saw my daughter & I then said that he couldn't check the bsmt but that it was illegal & we would have to vacate. Other than Charlie's attitude, we lived in that bsmt unit for over a year & a half with no problems but were forced to move.",2,2,2,1,1

I have been living at one of her buildings between 1-2 years (not being specific to remain anonymous) and it’s been awful. The building is infested with mice, which was not disclosed to us prior to moving on. To keep the mice out of our apartment we had to do over $200 of work to seal all holes with spray foam. We needed to clean the apartment when we moved in, there was mold in and cigarette ashes in every window. Outlet and light switch covers needed to be bought and installed by us. There are no baseboards. Light fixtures had mice poop in them. When the kitchen faucet started leaking water everywhere, she never fixed it and we had to buy a new faucet (which she has never paid us back for). People smoke in their apartments and the smell comes into ours, we are non-smokers with kids. It’s disgusting.  The rest of the building is worse, graffiti is everywhere, garbage all over the yard, the parking spaces don’t have numbers and people steal our parking spot. The mailbox took a year to be replaced, and we had to get our mail across town. The front door doesn’t lock and people stay in the stairwell to do drugs and sleep. I’m sure I’m missing things.

I repeat: run far run fast.

5437,MEDALLION PROPERTY MANAGEMENT,HAMILTON,ONTARIO,L8P2P9,CA,"This company is so brutal. I have been a tenant for nine years at this property. They purchased the building during my tenancy. 

While it’s a reliable stable rental, they are AWFUL with repairs and management. 

Just a few (of many!) examples: I have been left for months with a leak in my bathroom ceiling and a huge hole, I have been in the past left for SEVERAL weeks with no heat, and if you have heat, it’s scorching hot where you have to turn the AC on in the middle of winter. There’s TONS of garbage behind our building that they have yet to get rid of (months). 

At one point they contacted us to tell us they had a change in management and things would get better. They did replace our balconies, but this place needs SO much work. If they got their stuff together in the repairs and upkeep department, this place would be a dream. 

Last thing I’ll say — once they finally started working on my bathroom leak/ceiling, the contractor was going in and out on different days and times and one time, they showed up unannounced, I was in my bed SLEEPING because I had worked nights, and the Super knocked, came in, and LET THE CONTRACTOR IN WHILE I WAS SLEEPING AND DIDNT WAKE ME UP.

In the 3 years I've been here, two storms and subsequent power outages occurred that damaged my shed from their trees they refuse to trim or remove. The street i live on has not been swept for years and creates respiratory issues- lot fees we pay are supposed to cover road maintenance. 
Roads are full of potholes and my neighbor injured herself falling in one just the other week again. Every year they apply to increase rent past the 2% allowable amount claiming they made 'upgrades'. They also claim we have 'amenities' and 'common areas' which we certainly don't. 

During the first power outage residents here were without power for 2 weeks because they would not remove their tree from a power line, insisting the home owner would do it (they were out of town and it wasn't their responsibility).

They also release names of all the home owners in each park when they are trying to increase lot fees by 18%- clearly they do not think they have to follow any laws.

When we seen the place and signed the lease, we discussed what would be included in the rental and signed the agreement, gave an illegal damage deposit, plus first and last assuming we were getting everything included in the lease and what was shown us.  Throughout the year that we rented her place at Bells Park Rd she constantly texted and called to talk unprofessionally about her personal issues or ask questions about the apartment. She went back and forth on things that were included in the rental, for example, the washer and dryer use was in the lease and several times she took the use away for unreasonable excuses, the use of the backyard was in the lease given we got liability insurance to cover things as there was a pool and firepit back there (which is completely fine and understandable) It seems she forgot our agreement and insurance she required us to obtain, and told us we couldn't use the back yard due to liability and chained it off.   In the agreement we agreed every 6 months to have a walk through of the apartment to check fire alarms and the condition of the apartment (which no issue there). But she made reasons to enter the apartment once a month, if not more.  We had zero privacy in the unit. She made us feel like unwanted house guests more so than tenants over paying for a small 2 bedroom apartment. 
When I announced I was pregnant she wanted to charge my 2 year old daughter and unborn baby extra utilities since there were going to more people in the unit, and when we refused she tried to hike up the rent. When we threw the Ontario rent increase laws at her she decided to take away the washer and dryer use completely and became very cold and hard to deal with. 
The one good thing about her I will mention is that she loves and takes pride in her home so any repairs that needed to be done she was right on top of them in record time. That part was awesome and appreciated. 
When we gave our notice, she wrote us a letter of recommendation for our applications as we took care of her place very well.. But when they called her she had nothing but bad things to say about us costing us to loose several houses we pretty much had. 
She had us give an illegal damage deposit because we have a dog and a child, but when we moved out she ignored our request for it back, and has also not paid her portion of utilities for the last 2 months as they were required to be put in our name while living there.

5538,SKYLINE,FERGUS,ONTARIO,N1M2Y6,CA,"The building I lived in was an old building but very well maintained.  It was owned by Balnar Properties.  They were working on gutting each apartment and making them new again.  My apartment was beautiful.  The rent was reasonable and most of all we could pay EMT which allowed me to pay bi-weekly (always half a month ahead).  They were fine with this and always got rent on time.  When the snow fell, we got a notice immediately to clear out by next day to clear the snow.  Management would go out and shovel in the interm. I couldn't speak more highly about Balnar and the way they took care of tenants.
Skyline bought my building and several others in the community.  I can say everything did a 180.  Opposite to Balnar treatment.  Now rent was auto withdrawal only, No snow clearance, tenants (including disabled and seniors) were told to maintain there own parking space.  apartments had an ""as needed"" approach to them.  When the building would have repairs, like a roof, the tenants were billed for it in a rent increase.  When tenants moved out and new moved in the bare minimum was done.  My friend moved into a Skyline apartment with 4 or 5 different floors, and floors had chunks out of them still.  When you filed a grievance, it took months to be addressed.  When something needed fixed, again weeks to months to be fixed.  A fellow tenants toilet broke.  They handed her a bucket and said use this til its fixed.  They are a greedy money making business who couldn't give 2 shits about humans living in there building.  The increases on rent for the buildings, added hydro and parking costs, now have made simple apartment living impossible even charging upwards to 1800 for a bachelor. Shame Skyline, Shame!!!!",2,3,1,3,3

They didn't take out the garbage for the first 6mos so we had a neighbourhood garbage dump beside the house. More recently, they let me live with a broken fridge for 6 weeks, they messed with my electricity for 6mos last year, they haven't cleaned the hallway or foyer for about a year, and the lawn was strewn with garbage for 6mos. The garbage sometimes isn't even collected from the curb, and the garbage area is a mess. There was a broken bottle on the front walk that had fallen from a balcony and it was there for 3 weeks. They might give 24hrs notice of entry, and one year alone they gave notice 12 times. When they gave rent increase notices they asked for an illegal ""one-time top up remittance"" to keep the last month's rent even with first month's even though it's contrary to the Rental Tenancy Act. They took a neighbour to the tribunal for a ""personal use"" application and just bought them out ahead of the trial so there would be no record of it, and now they're trying to kick out another long-time tenant for ""personal use"" even though four units were open a couple months before they got their notice.

5601,MATHIEU ARSENEAULT,GATINEAU,QUEBEC,J8M 0A3,CA,"This was by far the worst landlord we've ever had. We were new to the area and had to move for work at the height of the pandemic, so we couldn't visit the apartment in person at first. By the time we got to, we had already paid a deposit for the first month and it was too late for us to back out. This landlord is a real estate agent and had us go into his real estate office and wait for him a substantial amount of time before coming in to sign. When he got there, we both said hello politely, eager to have a good relationship with our new landlord. He only said hello to my boyfriend, shook his hand and flew past me, ignoring me the rest of the time.
During our 1-year lease, we did absolutely no repairs, though we talked to him about several things that might need improvement. The apartment was in far worse condition than we thought when we got there and the previous tenant's things were no longer hiding walls and flooring. We had to foot the entire cost and effort of patching the hundreds of wholes and painting 2-3 fresh coats of neutral color in the whole apartment, among other things. 
It might also be worth mentioning that, while we were not allowed to have a dog under any circumstance, almost all the neighbors surrounding us had at least a large dog, and there was often dogshit on the path leading to the place, especially in winter and spring. 
A huge pet peeve was apparently everyone in the 4-plex had terrible trash hygiene and when we called the city, they said we need to take it up with the landlord, because apparently landlords are in charge of having the big container emptied. When we brought it up to him, it was like speaking into a void. Nothing changed.
About 2 months before we were set to leave, we discovered mold in our bedroom closet (the area and apartment were generally very humid, with no AC) and immediately contacted him, informing him we need help ASAP with this, as I have asthma and had already been feeling sick for weeks, but did not understand why. He told us to clean it with bleach, saying it had happened before, it'll make it go away for a while...
Finally, when we announced we would not renew our lease there, he not only pushed the burden of answering questions and organizing visits on us (though we weren't breaking our lease before it's end date), but also listed the apartment with pictures of a different apartment in the same building, saying it had ceramic and hardwood flooring with no carpet, when in fact it was all linoleum throughout the space and all the staircase was wrapped in old, stinky carpet. When we brought this up with him, he ignored us.
He did not show up to take the keys or tour the place when we moved out.
He once showed up during our workday (we WFH) to visit the apartment on the spot for some inspection he didn't explain. He then had us wait around for 2 hours and left without telling us, without coming in in the end...
I know for a fact that he raised the rent substantially between the previous tenant and us, riding the wave of the housing crisis to the best of his abilities.
He also consistently, for at least 4-5 months in a row, contacted us around mid-month to tell us we hadn't paid our rent when, not only had we paid right before or on the 1st, but we also took the habit of emailing him to inform him it had been paid, confirmation number for the e-transfer included. 
Overall, I would never suggest renting one of his properties. I've heard he's a great salesman, so do of that what you will, but as a landlord he's clearly in it for the easy money and isn't even willing to live up to basic responsibilities that the role entails. I will say that, except to try to scam more money out of you, he'll leave you alone, but also won't answer when you have issues. People should be evaluated on their ability to act like a good landlord, because someone like him shouldn't be entrusted with over 200 people's livelihoods (when signing he told us he owns ""226 doors"" that he rents).",3,1,3,3,1

3)rented a parking spot behind the unit and they never had assigned spots so they were over rented.

4) within the first month of living there, the tenants above me broke their toilet and flooded my bathroom from the ceiling fan, with a full waterfall. The damage was never repaired.

5) the bedroom heater never worked and they didn’t fix it.

6) the kitchen sink wasn’t installed properly. They wedged the trap in place under the sink with some cardboard. It slipped every few months and they fixed it FINALLY after 4 attempts.

5651,KELLER INVESTMENT PROPERTIES,FLAGSTAFF,ARIZONA,86001,US,"Woodcrest Apartments (managed by Keller Investment Properties) is definitely on the bottom end of complexes in the city.  Like any college town, the standards of landlords and property management companies are already very low.  If you intend on moving to Flagstaff and do not own property or do not have connections for housing, be aware that rent prices for what you get are not worth it.

Keller Investment Properties provide the bare minimum for ""luxury"" apartment prices. During our year at Woodcrest Apartments in Flagstaff, the water was turned off 3 to 4 times a month. We were consistently told to fill our bathtubs to be able to flush toilets. The internet provided by the complex went out several times. The only real amenity was a hot tub that was never in operation throughout our entire time at Woodcrest. The management of snow throughout the property during winter was poor. There were cars consistently getting stuck within the parking lots. We had countless issues with management during the move in process such as getting misquoted, lies about renovations and problems with getting our pets properly put into the lease.

Keller Investment Properties does not pay their employees enough. This is evident by the high turnover rate within the office and the general confusion from any questions asked to the staff.

Keller Investment Properties does not put enough money into the infrastructure of their complexes. This is evident by the hot water not working/water not working at all and the internet being extremely sporadic.

Avoid any Keller Investment Properties if at all possible.  For reference they have properties in Utah, Nevada and Arizona. If you are moving to Flagstaff, AZ, avoid Woodcrest Apartments.",2,3,2,4,2
5652,PREETI THOMAS/ ISSAC THOMAS,MARKHAM,ONTARIO,L6C1T4,CA,"There are so many issues with the landlords.
1. There house is filthy and infested with rats. After complaining like everyday for 3 weeks nothing they didn’t do anything.
2. There is no concern for privacy. Drunk landlord(Issac) would bang main door in the middle of the night.
3. Cleaning the common area was landlord responsibility and they never did(hired anyone) for it.
4. Internet sucks. And when I complained about it many times Issac verbally abused me. 
5. Landlords lived in Ottawa but they would randomly organize parties in their house in Markham and invite people who had no regards for tenants(drunk Indian men)
6. When we( me and another 2 tenants)decided to leave and broke the lease cause of the abuse mainly, Issac and Preeti used profanities.

So basically I won’t recommend new comers to go there. Trust me you won’t want another stupid headaches.

We asked her to at least remove all the nails from the deck teardown as we have a dog and didn't want them walking on old nails. She agreed, said it was done yet we still had to pick up over 170 nails ourselves, she didn't even try.

- washer and dryer were ancient and barely worked. She refused to replace and had the audacity to ask if she could store a relatively new washer/dryer in our garage while she tried to sell it (she bought new ones with the high rent we payed her for her own home and wouldn't even give us the old machines) 

- refused to pay for pest control even after I offered to pay half. Her reason was that I didn't let her know ahead of time but the only reason I didnt was because everything that was ever requested was never done so eventually you just stop asking.

-barricaded our back door so we wouldn't use it while she tore the deck down. She was scared of injuries/potential lawsuit if we used it. This is illegal (fire code reasons). She doesn't even understand the laws that govern this sort of thing.

-grossly overcharges for rent yet never ever uses any money to maintain the house.

- left a bunch of stuff in the basement cause she was too lazy to get rid of it before moving out.

-gave us grief when moving out for not cleaning even though we did. She blamed us for upsetting the new tenants when she wasn't able to set up a cleaning/painting service cause she had them moving in the same day we left as to not miss a single week of rent payments.

The rent increases every year were reasonable (~$25 a year), although the apartment could have used some upgrades. I got my full deposit back when I moved out. 

There were a couple of negatives: 1. they charge an extra fee to pay rent through their online portal 2. my apartment was the only one that hadn't been recently renovated, so it did not have many of the nice features of the rest of the building (a/c, stainless steel appliances, etc) but the rent amount reflected that 3. the heat was electric baseboards and didn't go throughout the whole apartment, so i had to buy a space heater for the small section without heat (the building was an old, converted house).",4,3,4,5,5

2. The worst management: The leasing management team is a bunch of arrogant bastards trained to dismiss your problem and milk money from you. They lie, they don't even try to hide their ingenuity. You have some unpleasant experience and need their assistance, they'd say ""oh other people don't have the problem and this is not our responsibility.""
3. Unable to handle package: Last year they started to force everyone to use Fetch, a third-party delivery service that accepts your package and then delivers to you. In less than one year they made so many errors: package was late, scheduled delivery got canceled at the last minute for no reason, lied about you not being at home (I even waited at my door with my phone to record the evidence), missing package, non-existent customer support (no phone call option, all you can do is to create a ticket and wait for their reply).
Despite all the mess, the management staff would insist this is a ""reputable service"" (Google review 1.4 btw), and suggested that ""you had the problems because you didn't use it correctly"" (sure, my fault that their driver failed to deliver and lied).

The units are relatively good quality too. I've lived with them a couple times, and while I've sometimes found some things that weren't 100% move-in ready, they've usually fixed them in reasonably short order. They also won't screw you on your security deposit. Small holes, carpet issues, whatever... they re-paint and re-carpet regularly anyway, so as long as you complete your lease and don't do anything too egregious, you *probably* won't see any deductions. I've rented from them several times in several different places and this has usually held true.

HOWEVER, they will raise your rent every year to ""market rate"" - often to the tune of hundreds of dollars. It's all figured out by an algorithm, and the local staff has very little say in it. The only way to get around this is to research rentals in your area, and make a case to the central office that they have priced the unit incorrectly and provide evidence of comparable units at a lower price. If you can do this, they will usually drop the increase, but there will still be an increase. Don't like it? Better get ready to move. It's awful.

Overall, it's a huge trade-off. I'd rate my experience generally positive, but because of their pricing policies, I couldn't recommend them in good conscience to anyone who doesn't have a ton of disposable income. Renter beware.",5,5,1,4,5

There are always vagrants running around through the neighborhood terrorizing the apartment complex - breaking into cars, breaking into apartments, stealing things off balconies etc.
2. They make money off of towing vehicles that are in the same spot for 3 days, or expired plates within the grace period, or your friends visiting, or any other way they can find to tow your car. Not to mention they tow it all the way to Denver so expect to pay more than $400 for a tow.
3. Their leasing staff isn't trained on the restrictions on the lease (which is literally their f*ing job) and they tell you lies before you rent so once you've signed the contract they can threaten to terminate your lease for following the direction of the leasing agent.
4. They don't do a damn thing before you move into the apartment too, all empty apartments have their smoke alarms beeping because THAT is how cheap these people are. When we moved in our dishwasher was leaking all over the floor, the garbage disposal was clogged and didn't work, none of the outlets in the kitchen worked, and its clear they don't paint or clean before they rent because the floors were FILTHY and the toilets had nasty stains, not to mention the rings around the bathtub, and the lock on the front door was broken. They over work and under pay their maintenance people, which is insane for the prices they change compared to the quality of hosing they provide.

They are the type of management that only keeps a building for the required two years, sells it, and moves on. We requested repairs with them and they sent the most ineffective maintenance team ever. If the repair invoice was too expensive for them, even if under market value, they would cancel further repairs. If repairs were approved they were done in the worst possible cheapest way. They knew the building had leaking problems which then caused black mold to grow but they still rented the spaces. They would advertise an apartment with certain amenities (free fridge, gas, trash, sewer, parking space, etc.) and with a certain price but the moment of filling out the paperwork they would remove the amenities and raise the rent price. They are very unorganized and seem to lose track of what was advertised on their page in regard to the apartments. They had no control over what charges were for what and who had to be paying for them. They as well would just show up to the apartments demanding to come in. If they provided a notice it was within the 24-hour mark but they would state for only one location (like asking for access to the garage) for them this represented the whole apartment. No, if you only state one location that is it. They then would call you non-stop and demand you leave work to open for them. They also lost copies of the keys to our apartment. I had to install cameras to catch them trying to come in and asking them to leave/stating to them at what time I would arrive.

The communities are laid out well, they have phenomenal pool, patio, pet, garden, workout, business, and event facilities. The staff and maintenance team are top notch, super helpful and responsive. I've never had any questions or maintenance requests go beyond same-day response/service, which is outstanding. There are tons of events to suit families, adults, and kids regularly, and they have weekly food trucks come in, which is a ton of fun to meet neighbors and enjoy good food. The apartment units are nice as well, as it goes for apartments. I've always lived in a 2 bed townhouse style unit, so my comments should be considered applicable to that experience. Having a 2 bed, 2.5 bath townhome with an attached garage at the prices offered is a great find. The newer communities have granite countertops and deep, large kitchen sinks, sleek cabinetry, crown moulding in the living area, large windows with quality blinds. On the downside - storage is a challenge - the newer properties offer a kitchen island, but it sacrifices storage space tremendously compared to earlier SRE Group kitchens. Bedroom closets in the townhomes offer a great deal of space for clothes hanging, but are narrow which doesn't allow for much more(eg shoes or other storage). they're workable, but you need to be creative with the space offered. Based on my personal experience, I wish the townhomes were a bit larger, to offer more storage - but they're very nice units none the less. The lease terms are the best you'll find. After a 12 month lease term, you move to a month to month set up, where the conditions of the lease still apply, but you only need provide 30 day notice if you intend to move out. That allows for a ton of flexibility that is unheard of with other rental companies. In the past, rent would only be raised at most 1x in a 12 month period. Not sure if that's still the case, but my rent hasn't always increased year over year (7 years in, only 3 rent increases), and when it has increased its been extremely reasonable. Because Schottenstein is local to Columbus, they know the market, the local trends, prime areas etc. Having that local touch makes a tremendous difference in the tenant experience. Can't recommend them enough.",5,5,5,5,5

He stays out of your business as long as you’re quiet and pay your rent on time. I’ve painted my place and he’s fine with that. Biggest complaint is maintenance. He’ll cut a hole in your wall to fix a leaky pipe and then just use duct tape to repair the hole in the wall. Shelf falling down? Just stick a broom handle under it to hold it up. That kind of thing. As long as it works, right? Another complaint is that I know he’s entered my suite without notice but I can’t prove it. I did find a paper coffee cup that wasn’t mine in a garbage can though. And my shower curtain had been opened when I know I had it closed. My neighbour told me that he came in to her apartment with some potential buyers (he was selling the building) while she was in bed, asleep.

The building is absolutely infested with bedbugs, or at least the 3rd floor is.

Every few months there are random 'inspections' (because they KNOW they will find them) followed by a completely pointless and ineffectual chemical spray. New neighbours moving in would inevitably get them too after just a few weeks, and since units are only treated one at a time to save money (instead of quarantining the floor/building like you are supposed to) the bugs just move around as they're driven from one apartment to another.

They also engage in illegal rent increases through sneaky means. I was told the garage was to be renovated, with my parking spot temporarily moved outside. When renovations were 'finished', I was not informed. Then had my fees jacked way up after asking to move back inside. 

Terrible bookkeeping as well -- we would frequently get eviction notices for non-payment of rent EVEN WHEN WE PAID IN FULL. We would have to go through the entire ordeal of contacting a paralegal and going through the tenant board only for them to block it (obviously, since we paid!).

Throughout our rental period, Ms Baru exercised her right to have the house reassessed for sale, though she kept maintaining that she would not sell and displace us. We believe that she did try to illegally evict us by claiming that an above allowance rent increase was necessary to cover her carrying costs, and that should we be unable to pay she would have to let one of her children live there. She did eventually back down once we asked her to send the correct notices.

The tennants below me had major mold and water damage issues he did not repair. My experience with repairs was that he would only ever fix something if it was absolutely necessary. A broken toilet? Yes. But a light fixture on the porch roof that was leaking through with water? Never. Whenever I did communicate with him I felt like I had to be careful not to anger him. Whenever he came by the unit for maintenance he would always be on the phone yelling at someone. It scared me. I eventually found myself another place and was so relieved to never have to deal with him again. He honestly scared me. I managed to get my damage deposit back only after threatening to take him to the tenancy board. Otherwise I'm sure he would have ghosted me even though I painted the whole apartment and it was in better condition than when I moved in.

INSTEAD, I was kept up by the neighbours until 5 am almost every night. Because the apartment was long and narrow, there was always at least one person being loud, causing noise pollution, keeping me awake or distracting me from work. And here's the thing: they weren't even being that loud - the apartment had literally ZERO noise blocking between both vertical neighbours and horizontal neighbours. I could hear phone conversations, I could hear TV's, I could hear people practicing flute and guitar, I could hear people having sex, I could hear people producing music, I could hear conversations, and I could hear parties as if I was in the room. I moved my bed to the kitchen to avoid hearing neighbours. After I moved it to the kitchen, my other neighbours threw a party in their kitchen. I broke out in tears multiple times, there was nothing I could do to escape the constant bombardment of noise. I could literally hear exactly what people were saying even if they were talking softly. I complained about this constantly and nothing ever happened. When I moved out I said it was because of the noise. Somehow she had the nerve to say she never heard any complaints. It was one of the worst years of my life. If you are misleading potential tenants to this level, your legality as a landlord should be questioned and you should be prosecuted by law. INSTEAD, I have this website to write a review.

The apartment I am in has next to no climate control. It regularly gets over 80 degrees in the apartment during summer, even with the A/C on full blast all day. This results in electric bills over $200 each month, which is an insane amount to have to pay to just be sweating in my apartment. It's just as bad in the winter. It was common to have the apartment get below 60 degrees no matter what the heat was set to. This caused the apartment to be miserable in both the summer and the winter. Any attempts to have this remedied was met with gaslighting management assuring me that this was completely normal, and I was ridiculous for implying otherwise.

The apartment is so old, that the chances of things being repaired is very low. Prior to this apartment, I can count on one hand the amount of times I have had to open a work order request. I have had to open over a dozen requests to have things fixed, and the success rate with that process has been very low. It is very common to hear that things can not be fixed due to the parts no longer being sold. It's clear management has no desire to resolve issues if it would cost them a dime to do so.

The noise during the summer is the worst out of any place I have lived, even including college. It's common to have the pool frequented by screaming children as early as 9 AM and as late as 2 AM. Working from home during this time was nearly impossible due to this amount of non-stop noise.

Nice forest setting with patios/balconies.
Large floorplans for the price.
Very convenient to 270 and 70.
Gas heat/stove, if you're into that. I am.
Remodeled with new appliances, countertops, and flooring a couple years ago.

Cons:
Remodeled vinyl flooring was glued onto the existing linoleum without cleaning. Becomes unglued when wet. God help you if you have kids that splash in the bathtub. Random ""planks"" started coming up within a month of the install, no need for water to help them along.
Remodel project also painted white over the wood cabinets. Paint immediately chipping off around the hinges. At least the new countertops are decent.
My AC has been broken for a year now. Maintenance took months to even look at it or try to address it. Once summer finished they gave up and promised a new condenser this spring. I'll believe it when I see it. Spent a grand on 2 portable AC units to try keep up during summer, enough to keep the bedroom and living room tolerable (but enjoy the 85F+ bathroom and kitchen). Maybe that's why they're taking their sweet time. No rent credits when asked.
Painted over mold in the bathroom. Maintenance guy even commented on it on their first visit, but nothing was done. Paint flaking off all over those painted-over moldy areas.
Insufficient parking. Good luck finding a spot after 5-6pm. You can park in the unlit guest areas instead.
Increasing crime. Cars getting broken into or stolen by Kia Boys. Shootings, stabbings. Had to get the police to let us walk through a crime scene where someone bled out on the sidewalk to get to our stairwell. Got woke up by gun shots the other night... went to look it up on the local news, they had a story about an unrelated shooting at the complex later that morning. Had a narcotics raid in the unit below me a couple years ago... cops shot out the windows and threw flashbangs inside. Great experience with young children! Counted 14 CPD in riot gear coming up the stairwell on my doorbell cam. Unit sat for months with shot-out windows, open to the elements.
Amazon/doordash/etc. have trouble finding your unit with the confusing layout and signage. About 80% chance your items will be stolen if misdelivered.
Lots of non-functioning lighting in common areas and sketchy twisty wood steps in the stairwells with broken trellises.
Many of the garages have water drainage issues, wonky doors, and plants growing inside. People park in the no-parking areas in front of the garages, leaving you no room to get in or out.

For example, I had my bathroom fully gutted for a couple days and not fully functional for about a month and a half. After airing my concerns with James, he understood my frustration and was willing to take a portion of my rent off of the next month. I would one hundred percent recommended him.

When we moved in the landlord didn't have the place ready and our hot water was off for the first week. The unit was not legal, either.
I had a backwater pipe that failed and was kept that way for the duration of a year long lease. I was frequently having backwater pump up through my drains all over my floors for a year. My toilet was unusable most of the time, for up to a week or two. Eventually there was just a large hole left there that wasn't repaired by the time I moved out so I was brushing my teeth on very flimsly boards covering a jagged, dirt pit in front of my bathroom sink. The insulation was non-existent, the hot water tank barely had 5 minutes of water, I'm pretty sure I was paying my neighbour's Hydro electricity bill for a year as well. The provided appliances all lacked lightbulbs and only two outlets in the entire apartment worked. These requests for a decent living space were ignored and largely, I would recommend not renting from them as all of their buildings are apparently like this, as I was told by the plumber who I basically saw at least twice a month for an entire year as my bathroom was barely functional.

I was forced to inhale secondhand smoke on a daily basis, and the mold issue was terrifying. Despite numerous requests for maintenance, nothing was ever done.

The management is downright terrible. They show no interest in fixing anything. The gym has been missing weights for months (they were stolen), and the laundry machines are always broken. The pool is closed more often than it's open, and the roads are a minefield of potholes. My car was broken into, and packages were stolen from the package room regularly.

The buildings themselves are outdated and poorly maintained, and the security is a complete joke. To make things worse, I had to argue for hours to correct random charges on my monthly statement.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this apartment complex to my worst enemy. The lack of attention to basic upkeep and maintenance is appalling, and the management's complete disregard for the safety and comfort of their tenants is infuriating.

WHAT A MISTAKE. Every month, there is something else that breaks or is infesting!

We moved in and the microwave, fridge, and tiles were broken. We tried to move out within 30 days because of their ""guarantee"" that but they reneged on it “because of COVID."" Like we could EVER use COVID as an excuse for not paying rent.

Then, the AC issues. Do not get me started - it's 82+ degrees CONSTANTLY upstairs, despite it being 70 downstairs. Why? ""Walls and only one vent in the townhouse upstairs rooms."" It's unlivable. The ""wood floors"" are stickers and are constantly coming up. We had an infestation of ants and now mini-water bugs! The sap from the trees covers the car every morning - not to mention all the spiders that cover our car mirror every morning. Living with the dumpster is a horrible experience too - we can't back out of our driveway because the recycling bins are moved in front of it. Not to mention the flies!!!

There were stains all over the carpet when we moved in, like they didn't replace or clean it from the prior tenant - paint stains all over the railings and carpet too. They couldn't get the fireplace working for months. And now? 2nd time with no COLD water in the primary bedroom. Paired with these bugs with ""pest control"" not coming for a week+?

We left after less than a year despite paying a ton to move! Lots of sq footage eaten up by stairs (52 to get from the car to the primary bedroom)! The walls are also paper thin. The staff do not care. Maintenance doesn't care. In 7 months, two of our neighbors have moved and now we know why. DO NOT MOVE HERE!

ETA: 7 emails from this week filled with typos and mistakes, unreadable links. Then we get this doozy - NO MAINTENANCE for the foreseeable future. How can they renege on a signed contract and change the contract without both parties agreeing? I literally got laughed at since we have TWO tickets in and they’ve been in for a month+ now (water stains on the ceiling and no cold water in the primary bath) and asked about rent rebates. Still waiting to hear about our requests and nothing from them.

Most of the cupboard space is filled with her 'supplements' and drugs or whatever she's putting in her body. I could barely make food and had to eat out all the time. When I did eat she would follow me around the house and 'shoo' me away into my room like a child. Extremely disrespectful way to treat your good tenant. Upon move in, she offered to hang curtains, I went away for the long weekend and they were not up - no big deal I will just put them up. When I tried to put them up apparently I was making too much noise and she came and yelled at me to be quiet.

5847,DUPUIS REALTY,SOMERVILLE,MARYLAND,02145,US,"Renting in the Winter Hill side of Somerville, I have plenty of horror stories about how DuPruis Realty handled issues and complaints. First, apartments that they offer are very much the ""ikea special"" and look very good on the surface but the build quality lets it down: no pipes or hvac was properly sealed meaning each connection to the bathroom, kitchen sink, dishwasher, refrigerator, had a 1 inch+ gap around the entire thing. This makes a highway for roaches and you quickly realize that there was no winning. Their solution was to lay down some expanding foam which was amazingly ineffective. After multiple calls the handyman left a large note on our door saying that we should ""clean our apartment more often"" which was insulting considering the fact that most of the wall connections weren't sealed.

Noise complaints are not taken seriously and you will be directed to contact the police (protip - if you are finding yourself in this situation you should 100% call the police and be sure to pass along the property management information and that they were the ones who advised you to do so).

The Tub was a refitting but as we found out was actually just a spray on ceramic which was so badly applied it chipped and peeled weeks after having it reapplied in the apartment (smelled like pineapple garbage). After some research this is because they never sanded the surface and literally just came there to apply it and call it a day.

Rent was raised every time the lease was renewed and contacting the office was very hit or miss since they have a single person as the point of contact. If the mail is late with your check you'll get a call regularly until the postal service gets there. While hounding you they will not accept electronic payments of any kind.

I tried to rent a unit back in 2020, they asked for three months rent to secure and I did. Signed all the paperwork, had a move in day and even booked movers, hydro, internet and all.

On the posting it had been indicated pet's were okay and there were no restrictions, so on my application I indicated I had a pet. Weeks after giving them my money and signing documents I get a call from the realtor asking me about my dog, which I found strange told them more about the size (small) and moved on. 

The next day they suddenly reach out telling me I need a co-signer, I who lives alone, single, no credit issues had no one to cosign for me they then told me I could give another two months rent to secure the unit. 

There was no way I was going to shell out 5 months rent - so they claimed I caused the deal to fall through and cancelled. During this time the LTB was closed and backlogged, so Royal York kept my close to 7k and withheld it only giving me a contract to release 2k of this money.

In desperation I did (I was now out of an apartment and had to live out of a family friend's whole in limbo looking for another opening for an apartment with another company). A year and a half down the line the LTB indicates in our meeting they were in the wrong, however because I signed the document I was out the money.

If you continue sending requests or complaints they just won’t renew your lease - obviously very few people make requests or complaints because of this. Units flood regularly, water shut offs once a week, sometimes lasting 25-48 hours without notice, constant break-in because they won’t fix the exterior door locks, charges after move outs even if the move out inspection paperwork is good. Allows problem tenants to continue living in the building even after harassing other tenants, causing non stop damage and noise disturbances to the rest of the building, and even after assaulting them. Discloses private information to other tenants like Full legal names, medication information, when a tenant is away/home, which vehicle is owned by which tenant.

The director will call you to make it seems like you are a valued tenant, but will lie about the work done. I don't mind the delays if whitin reason, but they will rarely keep you up to date.

The brown water stain on the ceiling was a metre in diameter. Another water leak occurred above my bathtub, and eventually resulted in a hole in the ceiling 7” in diameter. I also had significant buckling of the parquet flooring, about 10 sq ft.

I informed the building manager numerous, numerous times about this, I also filed formal maintenance requests, and called the head office (no one answered the phones). It took them over a year to respond. Their “fix” included paint over the damage and not fixing the actual leaks. The paint wasn’t the same shade as the original, so there was a giant extra white square on the ceiling. The leaks persisted and just caused water damage and brown staining over the paint jobs.

During COVID-19, they made laundry free, only to increase the cost of laundry immediately after masks were no longer required in the province.

One of my parents unexpectedly died, and I was late on one month’s rent as a result. I told the building manager about this and that I’ll pay the rent in about a week when I got paid (I just returned to work after my dad’s death) again, and a week later I got an eviction notice. I was going through the most difficult time of my life. I had a good paying job, but because I had to be home to take care of the aftermath of my father’s death, I wasn’t able to go to work, and thus, get paid.

A month before I was moving out, the building manager decided to tell me that I had access to an underground parking spot and locker despite them assigning me an exposed parking spot when I first moved in.

I lived in two different apartment buildings with Zulich, and the “updates” they did to these units was reminiscent of the early 2000s despite it being 2018-2020. “Landlord special” type work.

Bathroom ceiling leaking water more than once, I don’t know how they were “repairing” it but obviously it was just a bandaid solution since it kept happening. When I visited the apartment they had installed new flooring. When I moved in, they had dropped paint and caulking all over the floor, it looked dirty all the time because of the splatters. They never managed to fix it. The building smelled, it was nasty. Constant issues like fire alarms in the middle of the night, water being shut off for a whole day, garage/laundry room/mailroom/gym being closed. Absolutely terrible. When I gave my notice to leave, they gave me less than 24hrs for visits from potential tenants. All in all, I would never rent from them again.

1. Because of the shoddy work done by her husband, the basement ceiling is leaks water. The first time she seemed concerned. However as leaking kept happening, she starting dismissing the obvious water damage as condensation. 

2. Upon looking at the property, she said the items in the backyard would be cleared out. Upon moving in I soon discovered that her husband uses the backyard as a dumping ground for old AC parts, scrap metal etc. Whenever my boyfriend tried to clean up the place and put his junk to one side, he would just dump more stuff all over the place. 

3. They started construction upstairs and they cut through the ceiling and we had ceiling debris fall into our food while cooking dinner. They regular had saws and hammering going on after 7pm and on the weekends. When we reached out to the landlord, she said we were being immature and she didn’t have time for this. 

4. I subsequently called 311, because her husband and the workers they hired wouldn’t stop. At that point they began sending harassing messages to my boyfriend. 

5. When we gave notice to end the tenancy, she refused to respond to any realtors. She would answer and then say she would call back and never call back. As a result we lost out on a few homes.

This hole remained for 9 months before they finally patched it, and they still didn’t fix the leak so the ceiling was dripping water again within weeks.

I lived in a two bed two or so years ago and the rent increased $175/month despite us finding black mold several different times across the year and zero improvements being made. Our neighbor's water heater burst and because the property is now tilted, it all pooled in my bedroom. And the door wasn't big enough to get a water vacuum through so they just peeled the carpet up and pinned it to a bucket in the middle of my room leaving 75% of my room uninhabitable and ruining clothes. They took $100 off of my rent that month after I asked for more. Once only gave us 47 hours notice for a showing and did not respond to us when we told them 48's the legal minimum. The whole place was dank and damp and they left an industrial size dehumidifier that filled up daily and no compensation for the extra electric that cost us.

Never bothered to remedy the situation herself; served us substantial breach papers and she ""did not want to"" go to the RTDRS after we served our rejection to the eviction.
Also never told us our suite was unregistered with the City of Calgary. Black mold is also forming in the bathroom. The heat doesn't work properly in the basement. You can't park in the back in the winter. There's this huge ice puddle that forms and no salt was provided when asked. They never check the property and it's conditions out of their own free will. 
Also, she will not return the damage deposit depsite us giving the place back in better condition than when she initially gave it to us (fruit flies in the drains, cigarette butts everywhere, dead flies on the windowsills, crusty bathroom).

It’s a rooming house and it started off great at first. She started off being nice ish. I did avoid her because she would gossip and say mean things about past tenants and people she know. It made me uncomfortable but that was the only flaw at first. I was always polite whenever I saw her, even when she started being cruel to me (didn’t want to anger her and lose my place. Month to month lease once she hates you and spreads rumors it’s over. You are out). She does repairs in a timely manner. The place is safe, but it was very gross due to other tenants. I often cleaned the place without complaints. Cleaning calms me so I didn’t mind being responsible for cleaning the whole house. If anything, it made me less stressed since I could decompress that way after a long day of work and school. However, that ended up being how I coped when she turned on me. I kept to myself so her sudden switch came out of nowhere. I barely spoke to her and when I did I was polite (I am a quiet person so I mainly nodded and said short responses). Utilities are included! The rent price was fair. When the landlord started to hate me she started to lie that I was dirty… There was now gossip and rumors about me. It was so hard being treated that way. It was terrible when the tenants joined in on the bullying. There were times when after I move my packages would be sent there by mistake. I forgot to change the address so a few times things got sent there before I changed it. She was mean and never gave them to me. So I lost money that way. Idk why she kept them? My clothes size were too small for her (not trying to be mean) so it makes no sense to keep it. Unless it was to be petty? Idk. The house looks nice. The room was nice too. It was just the hostile environment that I took issue with. I would have stayed much longer if she was respectful. Looking back, I wish that I had the strength to stand up for myself. She was so mean. It made me feel so bad about myself. She also goes back on her word a lot. She would say that something was okay then switch up on you. She did it many times and then berated me for it. She okayed things verbally so it was easy to gaslight me. “You can use the sugar in the common area! That’s okay. I got it for the house” then gets mad at me when I use the sugar in front of her a few days later. I also lacked confidence and just got out of an abusive situation so I was not in any shape to defend myself even if I wanted to. I didn’t know how to speak up for myself so I blamed myself and dealt with the mean comments. My advice for if you want to move in, keep to yourself (like I have did the whole time). That is my only advice. I don’t know what else you can do to avoid her toxicity. Maybe, speaking up for yourself is something that could make your experience better than mine? I never spoke up for myself and just took it. If you speak up for yourself than she probably wouldn’t target you. She probably only messed with me because I am a weak person.",5,3,1,1,1

5991,FRANCES ALLEN,BELLINGHAM,WASHINGTON,98225,US,"My experience with this landlord was that she's well intentioned, but does have a lack of awareness of and adherence to WA laws regarding tenant rights, and personally holds ideals and priorities that made being her tenant continuously confusing, unsafe, time-consuming, and stressful. 
Within a month of living there, a no-notice entry occurred when a handyperson and landscaper I'd never met were allowed entry without any housemate being given notice until we came home to them in the utility closet; this was after a weather/downpour-related flooding incident we'd informed our landlord about which, granted, did need to be looked into for water damage. We let her know this was not legal or acceptable to not give us some kind of notice. She claimed to have forgotten, seeming to have a very casual view of the lawful 48-hour notice before entry.
Additionally, the house had a years-long squirrel infestation in its attic prior to my moving in (several soffits where the squirrels had chewed around old hardware cloth which once covered them became their regular entry points), including having chewed through the ceiling in a bathroom which had been patched up, and through the same bathroom's window screen (which we repaired ourselves with a screen patch we paid for out of pocket). Within a couple months of moving in, I heard daily scratching and activity in the attic above a shared studio room, and squirrels then chewed through some electrical wires which cut off power to parts of upstairs and the laundry room. The wiring was promptly fixed and power restored by her handyperson; however, she claimed to have heard pest control was a scam and apparently would not consider it further. The audible squirrel scratching/activity in the attic continued, and so fearing the potential for an electrical fire and/or dealing w/ a squirrel getting into the main parts of the house, my housemates and I began using (and paying for out of pocket for) large quantities of cinnamon powder, Hot Pepper Wax Animal Repellent spray, and a dubious plug-in ""electropulse"" Pest Repeller. We used the cinnamon and spray in the chewed-though soffits weekly, which were parallel to the attic area we heard the most scratching and activity. We often pounded on the studio room's ceiling whenever we heard the scratching and rustling, sometimes daily. After well over a year of this, our landlord's handyperson gave us hardware cloth and ceramic screws (which were unfortunately barely a usable size w/ the 1/4"" mesh hardware cloth) to re-cover the attic soffits ourselves in the places they'd been chewed through. We spent several hours trying to be thorough and make the nearly too small screws work with the hardware cloth in order to get it done.
At another point, our rental house's ""exterior"" studs (the house is very old and apparently had two sets of studs/walls, internal and external?) were found to be rotting at the base along one side of the house where dirt had built up and allowed water to sit. When the handyperson applied multiple coats of wood hardener to the base of many of these studs, the entire house instantly smelled of the fumes inside, which we had to ask about since we were given no information prior. Our housemate, who worked from home full-time during covid in the room right next to most of the application of wood-hardener, experienced regular headaches for weeks. Our landlord did give us a box fan to ventilate the adjacent living room. The fumes stayed in the house that we could smell for over two months, and eventually were only noticeable in the under-stair storage closet for up to a year after.
Our landlord also never fully addressed the guest toilet that ran ever 30 minutes in the several years I lived there, aside from the handyperson wiping the lip of the flush valve, which we informed her had not stopped the toilet from running. The large window above the kitchen sink usually dripped and pooled water on the sill when it rained too hard, and unfortunately was never addressed.
Lastly, we were told after the fact, that a housemate had failed to pay their portion of rent for two months before they later moved out. We were never even informed of this at any point by our landlord until after this housemate moved out of state. Unpaid rent, according to our group lease, was to be taken out of our collective deposits, which ultimately were; however, because our landlord initially made a verbal agreement with this housemate and then never told us, we were the ones who still had to pay for the landlord's personal choice to make private agreements outside of the lease with a single housemate. I would have preferred to be informed when the initial portion of rent was not paid in order to be a part of an in-person discussion to address it, so all housemates could have the opportunity to make and sign a written agreement for a timeline of how our deposits will be repaid by the housemate. Alternatively, because our landlord had instead made a private verbal agreement with this housemate, and our landlord then only told us after the housemate moved out of state, I do believe it should have been the landlord's responsibility to take the housemate to small claims court to recoup the missing rent, as we were never informed of this housemate's missing portion of rent or their private verbal agreement until the opportunity for direct communication and accountability with this housemate was made more challenging.
Thankfully, our water heater was promptly replaced after the old one stop working, and the upstairs shower drain was promptly re-sealed with the proper material to address a sudden leak due to improper calking material being used at some point, likely a long time ago. The area this leak affected on the laundry room's ceiling was also removed and patched up.",2,2,3,1,2

CONs: 1st floor bedroom window didn't lock; oven didn't worked; heat/air rarely worked; washer malfunctioned; there's no wifi/internet and if you get it installed, he will most likely tell other roommates (some who are most likely freeloaders, possible criminals and possibly under age) that YOUR wifi that YOU paid to have installed is the house wifi- and if you don't give others the password, he will most likely have his suspected goons disconnect the outside cable; BTW, the owner next door at 2313 will most likely without warning do demolition/ remodeling at all hours of the day so you won't get any sleep if you work graveyard shift- and if you ask him when will the demolition end he'll most likely act like a d**k and think you're trying to ""step to him""; there's also random shootings and fires in the neighborhood; so don't be a fool like I was and rent from sebastian openheinie- from what I hear, all of his properties around the Philadelphia area are like this.

My advice for sebastian openheinie: don't scam your tenant's with tenantalert.com/tenantcloud.com and say that the security deposit equates to some fraudulent  lease guarantee. also, be more accessible to tenants when they have legitimate concerns. don't just pawn them off to your secretary. finally, if you're not going to give tenants their security deposit back, i would suggest using it to take care of the above CONs",1,1,1,1,1
6007,TOWER COMPANIES,SILVER SPRING,MARYLAND,20910,US,"Company charged insufficient funds fees twice when we tried to pay rent because our banking app had an error resulting in our balance not being updated, resulting in us being a few dollars short. Called company to explain, got told that it was our fault and the extra ~100$ in fees would stand AND that we were banned from using autopay in the future due to two “insufficient funds” alerts.

Also did not return application fees from additional guarantors after telling us to delete their profiles from our application because only one guarantor was allowed. 

Not a bad place to live but expect tons of corporate bullshit if anything ever goes slightly wrong.

6008,LAKEWAY REALTY,BELLINGHAM,WASHINGTON,98225,US,"I loved in a moldy rental from Lakeway, specifically one owned by David Hanson. The roof leaked the entire time I lived there (almost 2 years). The landlords were aware of this and only sent maintenance out once to put down tar paper, which didn’t do anything. There was morning glory growing into the house from underneath, through cracks between the floor and walls. When the pipes froze they essentially told us “oh well, too bad”. I have have them in writing denying me new housing due to my income type.",1,1,2,2,1

He is extremely rude and uses threats and loopholes in the lease to extort tentants - read your lease carefully! In this market, try to avoid if possible.",2,1,1,2,1
6010,KEY RENTERS OF CHATTANOOGA,CHATTANOOGA,TENNESSEE,37415,US,"We have been renting from this company for approximately two years, and while we appreciate that they have not significantly increased our rent compared to other similar properties, the overall quality of repair and maintenance leaves much to be desired.

One notable issue involves an outlet that sparks and smolders every time we use the microwave. Despite multiple attempts to contact the rental company, including sending photographic evidence, they have failed to address the problem. Consequently, our kitchen circuit emits a burning plastic odor when operating appliances, such as a coffee maker.

Moreover, the rental company's excavation work in the backyard has been subpar. They have neglected to clean up debris, transforming our once-pleasant outdoor space into a derelict lot. Inadequate cleanup has led to flooding issues and damage to items left on the ground. Additionally, the presence of loose pipes has attracted a number of snakes to the area.

The lawn maintenance service provided by the rental company is also unsatisfactory, as they only tend to the lawn when it becomes excessively overgrown and exhibit little care for items on the lawn during their work.

Lastly, we have experienced billing issues due to the installation of a sump pump connected to our unit's electrical panel. We have repeatedly reached out to the rental company to address the electricity cost issue, but our concerns have been met with silence.

Overall, our experience with this rental company has been highly dissatisfying, and we cannot recommend their services.",1,1,3,5,5
6011,LAKEWAY REALTY,BELLINGHAM,WASHINGTON,98225,US,"Truly the worst of the worst in Bellingham. Their rentals are in terrible shape often with mold and vermin, and their repairs are laughably incompetent, insufficient, and unreliable. Things like ripping out tattered carpet and leaving bare splintered wood floors, spray painting over grease stains, etc.  They engage in retaliation and intimidation against renters who ask for too much (the bare minimum) of them. All interactions with Lakeway employees demonstrate a total lack of professionalism and respect, they see every renter as a person to screw over and flagrantly break the law knowing most of their renters lack the knowledge, time, and resources to take legal action against them. All the property management companies in Bellingham are bad, but none are worse than Lakeway.",1,1,1,1,1

6018,NICK BAKER WITH GOLDSTEIN INVESTMENT,BOSTON,MASSACHUSETTS,02133,US,"I’ve been living in Nick’s property for a year and a half. I sublet for 6 months with a written promise that I could resign without my roommate for another 6 months at the same price, for a total of one year of residence. At the time of resigning, he tried to increase rent by 600 dollars and tried to say I needed to sign a 15 month lease, despite his email saying I could resign for just 6 months at the current rate. We eventually struck a deal, one year at the same price. The whole time we lived there, we had cockroaches and mice that Nick did nothing about. I ended up paying out of pocket for an exterminator after his constant failure. We also had heat and hot water go out multiple times in the winter, which he legally had to fix within 24 hours and often it took 48. One night was so cold I got a hotel. He is also terrible at communicating and doesn’t respond to messages or phone calls. He also doubled the price of laundry posting a sign saying “don’t complain because you millennials will spend 7 dollars + tip on Starbucks everyday so raising laundry is nothing”. He then did a “cost analysis” of how much the average person spent a year on coffee. One time it ate my quarters and he didn’t repay me so I now do my laundry across the street.",1,1,5,1,1

6020,AXELA SHELBOURNE,HARTFORD,CONNECTICUT,06130,US,"As a back story, the building, 50 Morgan St in Hartford is a converted 17 floor Hotel. State and federal funding for most of the private project. Did top 9 floors, now doing bottom 9 floors and lobbies. 

We were charged $75/car per month to park in a condemned garage. We got the town to shut it down. During that period we were forced to park on the surface lot that did not have enough spaces for everyone. People parked in the fire lanes, blocking the false fire alarms that would happen 3 times a week. So the town started ticket/towing people in the fire lane. Landlord would not stop leasing regardless of no parking. Would not refund people who were towed.

 Then they tried to illegally reopen the garage and start charging again before they performed any repairs (aka still condemned). Had to call head Hartford housing inspector to come and shut them down, again. 

Construction on parking garage has been going on for over year and a half. My GF and I found paperwork from the town citing over 30 code violations on FIXES on parking garage. 

We have since lost more of the parking garage area because the town had condemned it and the landlord didn't tell is for months.

There's no security in the building so one individual would sneak into our gym (covered in mirrors) and film videos for his old fans with props. He would ask innocent people going by the gym for help taking photos. They didn't know until it was too late what was happening. He did this to 5 people. Property managers knew. Didn't report to police. My GF and I figured his ID out. Police didn't nothing (no surprise). News article comes out about it and our landlord said that we were aiding and abetting the sexual predator, who is currently on bail for public exposure?? Yeah we'd help him make a video of him doing what he's out on bail for, right??

New construction was removing asbestos floor tiles with a hand pick and hammer for over 2 months while sharing space w electricians, plumbers, framers etc. They propped open fire escape doors for all 9 floors of construction so asbestos dust lines the escape. 

They tried to illegally evicted 3 people that we now of. We helped then get out of those. 3 times they tried to illegally evict us, personally. If you cause a problem (tenants union) they were just start messing with your rent ledger. People would pay rent and the next day the credit was gone. Still took the money!

Axela Shelbourne is one of the bigger ""developers' in the area who's founded mostly by his buddy, the mayor, and the state contracts he awards him.

He was trying to set up a Yashiva community in Waterbury and was still taking deposits on homes AFTER the town denied his zoning permits for the project. Soulless man. He's a volunteer EMT, and told me he was smart for making people park in the fire lanes. Because he had to support his investors.  Promised it would never impact safety. Less than 24hr after we talked we had a fire alarm and the town started towing people as I had said.

6021,JOHAN (HANS) AND SUSAN (SUE) SCHUT,HOUSTON,TEXAS,77006,US,"The landlords were very slow to address water leaks/intrusion in the unit (many months time). The bathroom flooded when it rained and there was not action for a long time. Unit was infested with cockroaches and fruit flies when we moved in. Landlords would schedule maintenance without warning and expect to have people enter the unit. This would happen at least monthly. The best advanced warning I received was the night before. The usual was 1-2 hours before the contractor would arrive. Very inconsiderate. Property manager was friendly but basically just a middle-man. Not able to help you without land lords authorization. No communication about status of requests/concerns for weeks/months at a time. Many issues, like the leaking sink and mold growing rampantly in the garage, bathroom, and kitchen were never addressed.",2,1,4,2,2
6022,WEST REALTY - LAURELWOOD VILLAGE,CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP,PENNSYLVANIA,16066,US,"Rent goes up every single year.  Many places are now sitting vacant due to the increase in prices.  I myself am on my way out due to the price increases.  It's insane paying 1,300 for a 1 bed small space.  In addition, when work is done on the apartments by whomever they hire, there is a lot of damage left in their wake.  Water leaking into walls, poorly sealed windows, etc...  As well as having my own furniture broken/damaged.  The maintenance guys are nice and do quick work, but you need to approach them directly as reaching out to the office doesn't get a response a lot of the time.  I've reported mold growing on the bathroom cabinetry as it gets humid in the summer and management did nothing about it.  When I moved in there was moldy food left in the cabinets and water leaking from the  toilet.  The front door also had almost a 1/2 inch gap at the bottom.  The amount of spiders/centipedes that got in was utterly insane.  I had to fix that myself.",2,2,1,5,4
6023,HYDE PARK IN LEASIDE,TORONTO,ONTARIO,M4G4J8,CA,"Repair rating is 4 out of 5 based on personal experience as I still have repairs that have not been properly attended to a few years into my occupancy. For anything major, I'd expect that they would be fast to take care of problems.

Another fact to mention is that a lot of personal information was required in order to rent this property, including bank records, copies of pay slips, etc. It felt very invasive and I wasn't certain of their security and privacy practices towards protecting this information. I understand their position here, given the state of the rental market in Toronto, but it was over the top in my opinion.

The parking garage is filthy. They haven't cleaned it since I moved in years ago and it leaves a layer of dirt on vehicles in as little as a few days. While the property management company is good at managing their units, they have done a very poor job at managing their parking infrastructure.

Overall, this is a decent place to live. It's a quiet and safe neighbourhood and the management company does an appropriate job being respectful and attentive. It would take very little work on their behalf to get things to 5/5 across the board.",4,5,5,5,5
6024,WESTDALE,AURORA,COLORADO,80015,US,"Reflections at Cherry Creek is the name of the complex with Westdale managing. Unfortunately it’s tale as old as time, Denver is too expensive unless your parents are helping you out, so you are stuck renting crapholes run by real estate investment firms that couldn’t care less about their tenants or employees. My suggestion would be to pay your maintenxe team more (they are competent for the most part , but probably make too little to actually care) and set up some kind of AI to run your office.

My rent was $1040 when I moved in December 2020 and by December 2022 they raised rent to $1315. Most of the apartments are not leased. Maintenance takes roughly a week to get to your maintenance request.

6032,SARAT CHANDRA,BELLEVUE,WASHINGTON,98006,US,"The two most frustrating things done by this landlord was his lack of warnings whenever he would come visit the property and the fact that he always wanted to try and repair things himself before calling a professional. 

He would always text 10 to 15 minutes before arriving and which was a bit frustrating especially when we were not home and would have to rush home.

However, the rent goes up every time I sign a new lease and this year went up by $200 per month for a studio apartment. When I most recently renewed my lease, they had added a consent to share photo/video form that was required. The month-to-month rates are absolutely unaffordable, so my choices were to take the most affordable route and sign it or take a more expensive short-term lease and hope I could find a new place in a notoriously difficult housing market. When I first started renting with them 8 years ago, I would've given them a fantastic rating.

After 2+ years of me going above and beyond to manage repairs and maintenance of the whole crumbling property, find tenants for her, etc. while she lived abroad in South America, our lease was terminated with minimum notice so the property could be sold. She kept all tenants' deposits, and claimed damage which was either pre existing due to years of deferred maintenance, or charged and never repaired. She never provided receipts, even in response to a request from our attorney. (Among various fraud, she charged one tenant $350 to replace a door, then only put some paint on the corner of it without replacing. Text book landlord fraud.). She refused to reimburse expenses that I incurred hiring a repairman for their broken refrigerator. She even had the gall to charge us for replacing the lawn for ""letting it die"" during a statewide drought in which watering the lawn was illegal.

The maintenance department is excellent, probably one of the best I've had, but the admin's communication with tenants is poor, they don't take our thoughts into consideration when making decisions about our building, they are quick to threaten eviction, and they've taken advantage of Chicago's lack of rent control to raise my rent $500 in the last 2 years. I avoid going to their corporate office if I can because every time I've been there, I get treated like garbage and do not feel welcome or respected at all..

Well yeah... you own it and you used my deposit to fix everything. Super rude, dont trust her. She also didnt notify me of anything until 45 days after move out when its 30 days by law in virginia. She stated she didnt have to notify me which is not true. She also hiked my rent up by $500 in the middle of my lease while in grad school. Seems like she took her divorce anger out on me.

6066,MOREHOUSE REALTY,WINTER PARK,FLORIDA,32789,US,"Rented one of their properties for 5 years. At first things are fine, but as soon as you have any issues, it quickly turns sour. Upon moving in, there were several things needing repair, which the manager said would be fixed in the coming weeks. In my 5 years, none were repaired. The AC was destroyed during a hurricane, it took 2 weeks for them to send a repairman. There was a large hole cut into the wall to install the new lines, which was not fixed for over a year despite multiple inquiries. The water heater kept busting due to improper installation, one of which times exposed wires on the machine were submerged in water, causing it to boil. We suspected mold in the vents, they sent the shoddiest handyman that sprayed the AC intake with cleaning solution while on, causing the blower motor to blow up. He also drenched the vents with Pinesol, all of which we told the property manager, to which she accused us of lying. Every single repairman sent over multiple years was very bad, the majority of the time making the issue worse. Getting them to send anyone in the first place is like pulling teeth, and photos/videos of the issues go largely ignored. After accusing us of lying when we sat there and watched this man the entire time, we were pretty much done.

I will say a good point is they never raised the rent much compared with most other places, generally around $50 per year. They didn't bother us, no inspections or anything, only had a guy come take photos of the appliances once in those 5 years. So if your apartment doesn't have any issues, they're tolerable.

It’s nearly impossible to get the deposit back even though when I moved into my house it wasn’t clean. I got mine after repainting the apartment myself and leaving it in better condition than I got it in. My neighbors got nothing because they cleaned but didn’t fight them. I contacted them about a leaky toilet and nothing was ever done. Randomly I met a repair man that worked for the property owners and he was furious that nobody told him because the water was creating damage. He gave me his personal number so I wouldn’t have to go through Mia Madison. I lived in a duplex and the neighbors had an old AC unit and regularly had $500 summer electric bills. Thankfully my side had been updated. Just typical penny pinching property managers. The move out checklist is a book that you don’t get until you move out.

What he was saying was clearly BS.

He then followed up with telling us how we are obligated to find someone to jet out our own pipes, because ""none of his plumbers are getting back to him."" Luckily I worked for a different property management company and was able to get the pipes jetted out. Throughout the year long lease there the pipes had clogged 5 mores times and every single time it turned into it was our job to get a plumber... ontop of the plumber issue in our apartment.

Another real awful part of this land lord is that he doesn't get back to you when you call him. On 2 occasions while the plumbing was clogged and coming back up through the pipes he didn't respond to our calls or for a week plus. I guess the last straw was the hot water heater, the fridge and all the kitchen outlets stopped working and the landlord didn't respond for 1 week while they were all not working.

Living under his watchful eye has been a waking nightmare of bizarre incidents and sleepless nights. Picture Super Hans from Peep Show, give him the keys to your apartment, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what it's like to rent from Tobago.

First of all, let's talk about his nocturnal habits. The man has absolutely no concept of boundaries. I've woken up in the middle of the night to find him inexplicably fixing a leaky faucet in my bathroom while humming techno music. And the fact that he's constantly clad in a leopard print bathrobe doesn't help matters.

His obsession with eclectic music is also a cause for concern. 3 am drum solos and impromptu didgeridoo concerts are just some of the ""treats"" you can expect when living under Tobago's rule. I've tried to confront him about the noise, only to be met with nonsensical explanations about how the sounds are designed to ""align the chakras of the building.""

Maintenance requests are utterly unpredictable. I once asked him to fix a broken window, and instead, he installed a massive aquarium filled with exotic fish, claiming it would ""improve the feng shui of the place."" While it did add a certain ambiance, it did nothing to stop the draft.

The common areas are no safe haven either. The hallways are littered with obscure artwork and bizarre knick-knacks that Tobago insists have ""metaphysical properties."" I don't know about you, but I don't find it comforting to be greeted by a life-size statue of an ancient deity every time I leave my apartment.

When she realized she could be getting more rent for the property, she decided to successively raise our rent three times in thirty minutes so that we would get three different notices from the property management company (International Property Management). After doing so, we didn’t immediately move out, so we then got a notice that she wanted to sell the property, so we would have to vacate. During inspection to let us know what repairs we would need to make, we asked if we could leave some appliances, to which she responded that next renters would surely appreciate that. So really, she lied about selling the house so that she could jack the rent up even more after having a pretext to kick us out. After we did everything we were asked to make sure we got our deposit back, they only gave us a check for a fourth of the deposit. So now we’re taking her to court. Do not live in this woman’s properties. She will raise the rent every chance she gets. She will delay repairs needed on appliances or other damages to the property if they are going to cost her more than a hundred bucks to fix.

I had a rental increase of 30% in 2022 and an additional 25% rental increase in 2023. This 2023 rental hike would make my monthly rent higher than bigger units on the property. When I confronted the property managers (Maureen and Steven), they just blamed the property company and instead tried to encourage me to upsize to a new apartment. When I told them I was moving out and was done with their games, they revealed to me that they wanted me out of my apartment so that they could renovate. And setting an extremely high rate would do the job. Absolutely no respect for their tenants. You will be screwed over by Maureen and Steven and they will just claim it's out of their hands.

Other gems - the parking garage is infested with rats. I'm not sure how many of them have made their way inside of apartments. I could hear them walking around along the ceiling but never encountered any inside my unit. Also, the parking garage is huge and will take you at least 5 minutes to exit and enter if you park on the 4th or 5th floor. There's also an insane amount of speed bumps, so your suspension will be worn over time. Enjoy seeing the smashed rats on your drive in.

Then she made false claims about trash being left on the porch. I caught her on my doggy camera entering the apartment twice without notice or permission. She would show up to the property at odd hours, unannounced. She would call to berate me over things that were not founded in reality; at times she would be screaming and repeating the same phrase over and over, then hang up and call back, then continue to scream claiming I hung up on her. The casita had a severe mice infestation which she refused to resolve. I was catching a mouse minimum per day for at least 6 mos. She went as far as taking me to court for various false claims. I was able to collect written affidavits to provide in court from neighbors, proving she was making false claims. Her reputation was so bad, neighbors did everything they could to help protect me from her. I truly believe my situation would’ve been far worse without their affidavits and willingness to be called as witnesses, because Santa Fe is a city that gives tenants as minimal recourse as possible to protect themselves from outrageous landlords.

She insisted on sending someone around to clear the gutters. The floods kept getting worse every time, so it was clear that the gutters weren’t the problem: the insulation on the side of the building was inadequate. The landlord simply ignored our requests for a proper fix.

Understandably, we decided not to renew our lease. However, we made this decision during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when nobody knew just how infectious and deadly the virus was, and there was no vaccine in sight.

We thought we had two choices:

1. Potentially, we could compromise our health by staying in our apartment until the end of our lease. In this scenario, we'd risk our health by letting our landlord and potential new tenants in for showings.

2. Alternatively, we could compromise our budget. We'd give the landlord an extra month's notice. We'd empty out the apartment as much as possible during the first month of our notice period, and we'd move into a new place with most of our belongings at the beginning of the second month. This way, the landlord could let people in for showings without us being there during the second month. We'd then complete moving out on days when the landlord has no showings scheduled. We'd effectively pay two rents during the second month of our notice period, but at least we would not risk contracting COVID.

The landlord agreed with the 2nd option. To our surprise, we managed to move out all our things before the second month of our notice period. But we still had to clean the apartment before handing it over. When we returned with cleaning supplies at the beginning of the second month of this arrangement, we found someone living there. Turns out, the landlord didn't need to schedule any showings. She already had someone lined up. The moment she noticed that our things were gone, she let someone else move in and thereby collected rent twice for the same apartment: rent from us and rent from the new tenant.

We suspected this wasn't just unethical, but illegal as well. When we consulted with a lawyer, they told us that this indeed constituted an illegal eviction. Despite having clear documentation of our arrangement, the landlord denied all accountability or wrongdoing and even accused one of us of being an ungrateful, belligerent immigrant.

The one window in the front has been broken since around 2004. Not to mention the frequent drug dealers and fights. The nasty people smoke cigs all through the halls and around the kids. Needles on the ground and vehicles being damaged and broken into with no working cameras. Not to mention the parents letting the kids run through the halls and damage peoples property and peeing in peoples laundry. Literally the worst building I’ve ever seen. Known junkies come and go constantly , and the landlord is a joke, constantly raising rent and not doing anything to fix this place up. This building is unsafe and I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact someone needs to take the owner of this slum to the landlord board because no one should be allowed to Charge people to live in a scum hole like this one.

My only two complaints were that when I did need maintenance she would always have a delay in communicating with the maintenance guy of about a week. Problem always got fixed, but it just took a while. Oh, also the front door of the house became almost unopenable, but she declined to fix it because the side door worked. The other problem was that the rent went up by 50 -100 dollars every year no matter what. Service never got noticeably better but rent sure went up.

They did awful, crappy, unnecessary and cosmetic upgrades to the buildings - which caused MAJOR problems, Human Rights Violations as well as inconveniences to the tenants.  They refused to provide ANY proper accommodations despite requests and the tenants going to the City of Toronto, our City Councillor, MPP, MP as well as the media.  They then Filed and were awarded a 3.2% AGI (Above Guideline Rental Increase) and afterwards they filed an Application to Demolish the properties into Condos with the City of Toronto.  WHY should tenants PAY for upgrades in a building that will be destroyed? Why would a Management Company even invest money into a building they were going to destroy in 5 years or less? Especially when these Improvements were NOT necessary, not required, were cosmestic or deferred maintenance ?   This is a financialized Landlord seeking to displace tenants and re-develop older buildings into Condo's.  
While they have done these so called ""Upgrades"" - Compten Management has cut back on basic maintenance issues - cleaning and garbage - which has resulted into on-going fly, cockroach, and other pest infestations. Tenants have made multiple complaints over the last 4 years to the City and we still have NOT gotten the situation fully resolved.  They refuse to deal with ANY Human Rights Accommodation Requests - even when tenants have had letters written from Legal Aid Offices or CERA/CCHR.  This Landlord simply will not comply with basic Residential Tenancies Act or City By Laws - They are owned by Jack Greenberg a Lawyer who uses his position to threaten, coerce and harass tenants with potential litigation if they do not comply with the Management Company's requests.

All I can say is do not trust Estelle as she is not educated enough to hold the position she is currently in and if financially possible, look elsewhere for a place to live. I am not going to ramble as it make the review sound like I am holding a grudge and acting on emotion.

Egla is a paternalistic parasite of the lowest order, eagerly taking advantage of the young and uneducated, the elderly, disabled, the downtrodden, and uninformed newcomers alike. When informed that our thermostat did not work (during the winter) she did nothing. When informed that the bar of our oven door had fallen off, her first move was to take the oven door bar for SIX MONTHS before her husband finally returned... to haphazardly glue it on (it fell off again two days later). An even unluckier tenant, a very young man with no family in the province, was forced to sleep in a glorified storage room during the coldest months of the year when she refused to fix his broken window in a timely manner.

Egla also possesses an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the rental system in Nova Scotia, as well, having used an out-of-date standard lease form for years. When she attempted to evict me unlawfully and was subsequently brought before the Tenancy Board for a hearing, she changed her story in the middle of the hearing to try and push me out of my unit, going as far as to say that she needed me out, no matter what. (She was not successful.)

Tenants changed out every few months, as she began using fixed-term leases for every unit so she could raise the rent indiscriminately between tenants.

At one point they threatened to evict us for refusing to pay several hundred dollars in fees that they admitted in writing we didn't even owe. We said we would be happy to let a judge see what they were doing and get a housing attorney, and they relented. They kept trying to make excuses to inspect the house without an appointment, which is against Texas law. They also doubled the rent on the house inside of 4 years, way out of line with market conditions. Their behavior was so horrible we decided to cash in our retirement funds and buy a house. The house is in disrepair. It took them over two weeks to replace the dishwasher, and the sewer pipe was collapsing in the backyard. They refused to pay for plumbing repairs even though the issue was obviously caused by the collapsing pipe. The backyard is full of sinkholes emitting sewer gas. They also tried to require us to pay for repairs to the house not related to wear and tear. The house was given to us in filthy condition but they are insisting we have to return it in pristine condition or face fees of more than $400/room.

They changed the company that was handling their renter's insurance 4 times in 2-3 years, and each time they started wrongly charging insurance fees. They made it the renter's responsibility to deal with all these other companies and register over and over again, and try to get refunds. They never gave notice, despite their claims to the contrary.

Technically this building is supposed to have a ""community room"", a sauna, and a pool. They closed and locked all three of those to save money. 

They shut down the trash chutes and brought in a ""valet living"" trash service that we're forced to pay $35 a month for, even though we had a perfectly working trash chute on every floor. I live literally 10 feet from the trash chute and instead i'm only allowed to take out my trash once a day between 5:30 and 7:30 pm, AND the valet trash people are required to take photos of my trash can so if I don't place my trash out ""properly"" they can charge me an extra $25 per offense. The trash rules they make you follow are ridiculous, the trash can is tiny, so if you have to throw two bags of trash out, i have to stack one on top of the can, which can fall over, thus touching the ground, which will cost me more. 

They raise the rent as much as they legally can every year in Seattle (10%) and raised the parking costs 25% to $250/mo. They're consistently messing with the hot water pressure, so I've had to take military-style showers or schedule showers at non-peak times... not always a possibility.

This building has two perfectly working elevators, but they've decided to shut one down to use their newfound rent money from us to replace them, so they're shutting one down for 30 WEEKS, then the other one, for a total of 60 WEEKS. people moving in or out can't reserve the one working elevator, which the valet trash people use to haul trash manually down to the dumpster in the basement every night. In short, the management obviously treats us like nothing more than a commodity, The hallways are filled with trash every night, we have one working elevator for a 25 floor building, the entrance door is broken apparently, and they've taken away any sense of community.

There were many other unfinished issues: No light fixture in the bedroom, just an uncovered bulb in the ceiling; no pull cord in closet for the light; badly sloping foundation; laminate floor tiles buckled & creating trip hazard. They neglected to tell me they have NO maintenance staff. Repairs take days to even get a first response & often weeks to complete because the contractors they use only want to work at night. As a single female, I found this unacceptable. They refused to give me a key to the mailbox, stating it was MY responsibility to go to the post office & request one then pay to have my copy provided. According to the post office that was not true, and it took weeks for me to finally get a key from Stonewall. I am not one to leave poor reviews out of spite. I pay my rent on time, in full. I understand not every issue is urgent an can await resolution for small problems. These people are such poor managers, I want others to know in advance that if you value even marginally competent management, this company will not provide it.",2,3,3,4,2

I asked if she could call me because I needed to break the lease early and wanted to discuss options. Like, DISCUSS it, like adults. She didn’t respond and instead got her lawyer husband (who practices an entirely unrelated area of law) to send me a letter on legal letterhead which was threatening in tone and didn’t align with my rights under the BC Residential Tenancy Act. He threatened major expenses for me after I responded with a polite query pointing to a relevant section of the RTA. 
When I did move out, I left the place spotless. Every prior landlord had been beyond pleased with the condition I left their units, and this was up to the same standard. They sent two women I’d never seen before who had clearly been instructed to inform me the place wasn’t clean enough, no matter what. They also had no idea what a Condition Inspection Report is, a standard form used in property rentals. When I refused to be extorted for professional cleaning fees on a spotless apartment, the owner went to the Residential Tenancy Branch claiming I’d done $4000 worth of damage – completely fabricated. They included pictures that weren’t even in my unit (hey, my apartment didn’t have textured walls – nor am I responsible for ceiling stains from moisture seepage from the roof). And get this, they FORGED a carpet cleaning receipt to submit as “evidence” – I had shampooed the carpet myself with a steam cleaner. They altered a carpet cleaning receipt from the unit next to mine and I was able to confirm this with the carpet cleaning company that it wasn’t for my unit.
What they didn’t know was that I had taken many, many pictures of every part of the apartment after I’d cleaned it, to prove I hadn’t left it dirty. 
They lost their hearing due to multiple factors and total incompetence on their part, and then tried to escalate legally. Nothing came of it, but these people are really not worth the grief to rent from – stay far, far, away. I think they mostly rent to foreign exchange students who don’t understand their rights in BC and are therefor easily taken advantage of.

Some maintenance issues from day 1 as well, which they took several weeks to respond to - all things they should have looked at during the moving out of the previous tenant IE cabinets coming off at the hinges. 
Besides the above I have had no issues major issues besides cigarette smell in the halls at any given time despite a no smoking indoors policy - living there has been smooth for the most part following the gut-wrenching cleaning I had to do on the first day of living there. There is the occasional night of loud music or partying; the few times this has been unfairly disruptive IE 1am on a Tuesday the landlord is quick to respond and ask the other person to quiet down which I do like. 
It’s not necessarily a problem but I would like to note on here that the building staff find some reason or another to enter your unit typically once every couple of months; they do this after providing written notice and it’s usually just to flush the toilet during the day. 
They are a good landlord overall, if you are anal about good hygiene and having things in good repair then I would avoid.

There were 4 of us, as it was advertised as a 4 bdrm house. Things were fine for about a year and a half, until the landlord suddenly sent us a letter saying they had ""recently noticed"" that there were 4 of us living in the house that were non-related or common law, that this violated their home insurance policy, and that the 4th tenant had to move out immediately. Otherwise they threatened eviction. We filed a dispute with the RTB on the grounds that we had been upfront from the beginning that there were 4 of us, and that if it violated their insurance, the onus was on them to know that, not us as tenants. By the time our hearing came around, the 4th person has left anyway, and we didn't want to stay. RTB brokered an agreement where the landlord agreed to let us stay ""up to January 31, 2022"" while we looked for a place. We started looking right away, had a lot of trouble finding a place. Finally found some decent prospects, but landlords told us, no, the RTB said you had to stay until January 31. This was incorrect, as the wording was ""up to"", but we had to file for official clarification. RTB sided with us, we moved out December 31. Upon move out, landlords tried to ding us on literally everything, including saying we were responsible for hiring a professional cleaning company and a power washing company for the patio. A few weeks after moving out, they sent us a quote from a ""construction company"" billing us $2300 in repairs, in addition to keeping our deposit of $1500. Construction company was just one of their Chinese friends, and we did not pay, despite them ""graciously"" offering to waive $400 for cleaning company fee if we paid before January 15. They are now trying to take us to rental court over this ridiculously inflated repair fee, which is very obviously them just  trying to get us to pay for their home renovations. We counter-claimed, stating that by law, they had until the 15th to either return our deposit or file an RTB dispute. They did not file until the 22nd. More recently, they made an addendum to their claim, saying that in addition to the $3800 they are already trying to claim, that we owe them a further $3100 for ""missing rent"" for January. This is despite us moving out in December, us giving proper notice, the RTB confirming we were not obligated to stay until January 31 as long as we provided 1 month notice, AND them having a new tenant move in January 1st. DO NOT rent from them, or they will scam you, threaten and intimidate you, and come after you. Oh, and did I forget to mention the house had a mice infestation? Steer clear. ",1,1,1,3,1

There was a fire on the 25th floor and our alarms didn't go off. Since they never clean the dryer vents, it's only a matter of time before there's a fire.

Due to them being unfamiliar with email, we were not able to have written or digital records of any issues. A constant issue in the building was that our unit and building were infested with ants. Our unit was exterminated five times in a year and the ands continued to return. Ultimately, what has led me to leave this review and rating is that once we decided to move out from the unit after a year was their inflexibility with rental prices (the unit and building were old and they were charging more rent than other units in the building and were not willing to consider a lower price). Once we ended our lease, they began bullying us and became belligerent. We cleaned our unit impeccably, but they wanted to charge our damage deposit for leaving one nail hole in the wall and not dusting the inside of the closet DOOR before we moved out. They yelled and screamed at us and blamed previous damage that was noted in our original damage report on us. It became a Jekyll and Hyde situation with them. I do not recommend renting from them!

TLDR: Devon properties is full of thieves planning on turning our community into a slum city.

I had called and arranged a date and time to move in, to have one of the elevators put on hold. They never did this, didn’t put any padding up (like they did for other tenants), and claimed they had no idea I was moving in, despite showing them the email chain that they had been replying to. 

The apartment was unfinished. Paint was not done and there was damage all over the apartment, dings on walls, damaged drywall, scuffed paint, damaged tub, damaged microwave, and the floor was peeling up (remember this is a BRAND NEW building). The building manager promised the work would be done and the issues corrected. I never saw any repairs done, even after a year of being there and multiple calls/emails/visits. Every time I brought it up I was promised the work would be done soon. Lies, lies, lies. The work was never done when I moved out, and the mdf trim that was in the washroom that was never sealed or painted was already starting to warp.

The heat pump stopped working correctly and they said it would be 5 months to get a repairman in to look at it (so I just fixed it myself). 

The washer and dryer stopped working and after weeks of waiting, they told me it would be a couple weeks for the tech to come take a look at it, they never did come. 

Each unit had a storage locker that was supposed to be on the same floor as the apartment (this was in the lease), it took me 5 months before I got the storage locker and mine was down in the basement. They left the keys in the storage lockers and just let people have a free for all until they got things relatively sorted out after another month of bs. 

There were no lightbulbs in the fixtures when I moved in, and this was marked on my inspection. They still tried to charge me for no lightbulbs when I moved out.

They sent a maintenance guy to the apartment with no notice to fix the kitchen sinks, there was no overflow drainage in them. The guy looked like a bum off the street and showed up while I was at work. He tried to force his way into the apartment while my girlfriend was there alone, and scared her with how aggressive he was being. He literally tried to shove his way into the apartment.

They went through 4 building managers during the year that I was there. They mistreated, overworked, and underpaid all of them. So they kept quitting.

The website they used for paying rent was constantly down. It didn’t work, it would crash all the time, and wouldn’t process payments reliably, and often took several days to do so. As a result I got hit with many late fees and ended up getting cheques to pay with.

When I moved out, they tried to claim that I didn’t pay my last months rent (I did). I showed them the carbon copy of the cheque, the cheque image, and a screenshot of the money coming out of my account. They refused to acknowledge any of this and still sent the balance to collections.",1,2,1,1,1

6393,DAVID VISCO,BOSTON ,MASSACHUSETTS,02135,US,"- when a skunk moved in under our porch, which blocked our only exit to the driveway, David told us it was not his problem; we would have to call animal control.
- David frequently surveyed the property without notice and entered the property several times without notice. 
- David often parked perpendicular across the end of the driveway and blocked us in
- when an absolute nightmare of a person moved in downstairs after 5 years of us never complaining about any of the above listed items, David did nothing to stop them from playing loud music constantly, smoking indoors (which we could smell all through our apartment), screaming and fighting with one another (we called the cops at least twice on them); they had an aggressive German shepherd that would jump over the fence into our neighbor’s yards or lunge at people walking by on the sidewalk, and they never cleaned up his poop. Also would not allow me to break my lease and move out when I told him it was making it impossible to teach remotely (this was during the pandemic when schools shut down, I am a teacher.)
- David owns at least 4 properties in Brighton (Boston) and two of them were also occupied by my coworkers, one of whom is a gay man, who lived with two other gay men. David was MUCH more invasive and strict to him & his roommates compared to me or my other hetero coworker that he was also renting to. I saw the communication between them myself and he was much more brusque and intolerant of things that he never commented on to me & my roommate, like the cleanliness and location of our trash bins. He also harassed them about anything that remained visible on their front porch, meanwhile he let my horrid downstairs neighbors leave an entire (destroyed) sectional couch, dog crate, and literal garbage pile up on our front porch for months and David never did or said anything about it.

They will repair basic appliances relatively quickly, but built in equipment like sliding doors will just be permanently broken, they won’t fix it for you properly. Their staff are poorly treated and overworked, always running around putting out fires, I always feel bad asking for help. They will arbitrarily increase rent, by over 15% in a given year. The worst part by far is how they scam you with a rental model based on ‘incentives.’ Likely your rent will be set at a ridiculous level well above fair market rent, and then they offer several hundreds of dollars in ‘incentives’ to bring the rent down to a reasonable level. They do this for two reasons, one so they can increase your rent by any amount they want to in any year, because of course you already legally agreed to pay 30% more than what you’re paying, we just happened to remove 30% of incentives. Second they do this as a cover for their investors, their balance sheet is artificially inflated by showing higher income and expenses, making them seem more valuable on paper.

Pros: very spacious, big windows, sunken living room with spacious balcony

Cons:

Holes in ceilings, holes in walls. Cockroaches and bedbugs + inadequate pest control. Water running down the elevator shaft walls at all times of day/night. Drug dealers loitering in the parking lot. Leaky pipes dripping through holes in ceilings. adjustable thermostats from a bygone era, broken, painted over and forgotten. Garbage all over the property. 

Clogged drainage at the bottom of the garage ramp so during heavy rains a mini flood would enter the garage every time the door opened. In winter, the door froze open on the coldest night of the year, causing the sprinkler pipes to burst and damage my car. 

Gang fight on property one day which ended in multiple stabbings. Yet they still didn't hire any form of security after that. 

dirty hallways, dirty elevators, other tenants treated it like a garbage dump. 

outdated and damaged. Previous tenants did 1000s of dollars in damage but corporation only gave management half of what they needed to fix it.

4) Your lease might say you're in a non-smoking building, but what they fail to tell you up front is that the building is full of 'grandfathered' tenants who hotbox their units, stinking up the entire building.

It's going back up to $1800.00 June 1. We pay utilities. The only thing that has been fixed while we've been here is the p-trap when it leaked. It destroyed the kitchen ceiling, the walls and the ceiling in the living room. Water was pouring from the kitchen pipe down 3 stories and into the garage. Garage ceiling is all warped and needs fixing. It's unsightly. We don't have people over because the ceiling is gross in the kitchen. This happened in 2018. It's 2023.

6485,NATHAN CHANG CLAREVIEW PARK ESTATES,EDMONTON,ALBERTA,T5Y0Z6,CA,"I rented here for 5 years. When we looked at the place, the property managers were a couple. Of skids. They wanted the damage deposit in cash. Owner told me months later that this couple stole the money. There was supposed to be a washer/dryer in unit, property managers sold it and took the money. I had to buy my own washer and dryer. Was never given a walk through or given a least to sign. Owner Nathan Chan fires that couple and replace with another who last only a few months. Nathan fired them and hired an old lady who was pleasant until you meet her alcoholic son, who wasn't listed on anything legally regarding authority but took it upon himself to take over for his mother. He would attempt to fix things that he wasn't qualified to fix. We had an issue with our electrical box and they sent a first year apprentice from another building who owed money to fix it. The guy told me straight out that he wasn't qualified for this repair but they offered to take money off the rent he owed to fix it. It never got fixed. Dwayne is the alcoholic son. I was a single mom who he enjoyed tormenting. He would come give entry notices for less than 24 hours and when you argued with him it wasn't legal, he would throw a fit. Very scary. He loved to intimidate people, or try to. I'd stand up to him. In the last year alone that we were there, I got 147 entry notices about the furnace that not once got fixed. There was so many that I kept them all. There was a work order by the city to fix the furnace that never happened. We lived on the 3rd floor and when it was windy, the patio doors would blow inward when closed. They never cleaned the fireplaces. 

Dwayne was working with another drunk on the furnace in the hallway. They were working on that thing all the time, most of every week for 2 months. They never did fix it which caused a fire. My son noticed smoke in the hallway, called 911, got the cats in the crate and went outside and called me at work from one of the firefighters cell phones. This was 2 weeks before Christmas. The Red Cross provided us with accommodations for 3 days, then we were on our own. The fire was in the hallway from that furnace they were trying to fix. The ceiling in our hallway was gutted and we couldn't get back in for 3 weeks. We spent Christmas in a hotel. We were told that there would be a discount on January rent but when it came time to pay, they gaslight me and the other tenants. I ended up moving due to safety issues. The places should be torn down. Never got my $1200.00 damage deposit since owner, Nathan Chang said it got stolen by his property managers. 

When something needed to be repaired, he would hire illegal Chinese workers. They would come by mini van for 2 weeks a year and get dropped off, then picked up again at night. There are so many city of Edmonton work orders on the place. Read for yourself: https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/phab/phab-09-2018-decision.pdf

The backdoor has a major amount of frost on it, and we eventually found mold in the front closet, we reported both, and were out of there the following month.  I think as far as tenants go, we were a dream for them, as we didn't leave any holes in any walls, we got our full deposit back without any issue, the guy did a scan through the place, and that was it.

If you see him renting a place, just be aware that you're here to live in the place as is, it's not getting better, and it may get a little worse, but not terribly so, and he'll probably not ask for an increase in rent.

We were without a washing machine for a month, without a dishwasher for a month, and unable to access our garage for a month- and received no credit to reflect the inconvenience of being without an amenity for which we overpay. The maintenance staff does try, but they're overextended and frankly many of them are not competent to perform the needed repairs. The office staff is incompetent and Sunny in particular is rude to actively hostile. Rent goes up every year despite there being no improvements to the property. Crime has increased in the area, and there is a lot of theft of packages or from cars. We pay for security that is never present, and were charged for a package room that is not used (Management angrily insists it's every single delivery service's fault, which seems unlikely). There is a lot of noise and management does nothing to handle tenants breaking noise rules (Difficult when you need to sleep for work) or harassing others.

The halls were always dirty, and the building was poorly maintained.

My only complaint was with repairs. They were so far behind on addressing my repair requests. I mean, i was sleeping on my couch guarding the front door bc it had came off the hinges. It was propped up against my couch. I was in a duplex but STILL. So i essentially had no door. It took weeks to be fixed. Which is not okay. Every repair was similar, they just didn’t want to pay any money to repairs. Then they kicked out the tenants underneath me in order to move in their adult son and his family. They didn't have a good reason to make the previous tenants leave, and it was wrong of them to do. It turned into an ugly court battle.

Also worth mentioning, these apartments are freezing cold almost always but in the winter especially. They are very spacious for what they are too.

It is a nice community in some ways. Theres a pretty nice well equipped fitness room available to residents, a few fitness classes, a nice playground for the kids, a dog park, and an outdoor pool. Repairs are done pretty quickly but because they use EXTREMELY cheap materials and parts, the repairs are needed constantly. The maintenance guy is here at least weekly. In the first month i needed a new dishwasher installed, a new garbage disposal, fix the  doors that were installed backwards,and more. The front door of my building doesnt always shut and lock, so its not always secure. In october 2022, they are charging me $1400 for 2 bdrm 1 bath plus a garage.

4) Tenant Privacy. The management office would constantly call me at work and ask me if I still lived there for some reason. And I found some of my things moved around one day when I came back.

She does not respond or provide any written notices, everything is through WeChat messages or voice clips. She ""does not believe in written agreements"" and this is where I fell into this scam because we did not sign an agreement so there was never clear details to the terms of the rent. When you inquire about the room, she will tell you there are no rules, that you can leave any time no strings attached, that she is very open and approachable and she will try to help you adapt to Canada. The longer you stay there, you will start to realize that she will impose more and more rules and restrictions leaving you no choice but to leave. When you try to leave, that's when she will tell you that the agreement is for one year and that you have to pay for her losses up to 1 year rent. This landlord rents our rooms to students new to Canada and she specifically targets these people to take advantage of them. I was a victim of this and I would absolutely recommend anyone to avoid this place if you had any other choice. If this is your only option, please please make sure you ask for an agreement detailing the terms of the rent, make sure she will provide you with a lock and key to your room and make sure you understand all the rules before giving her your money.

Some things that I have experienced during my time there....

She invades my privacy by entering my room when I'm at school during the day, she does not allow me to use the kitchen to cook (after cancelling the meal plan with her), she does not provide the proper heating or cooling to my room (I literally need to walk around with a blanket or have my jacket on in the winter time or have a fan blowing on blocks of ice in the summer). She did not provide proper lighting to the room and does not even allow the light fixtures to have all the light bulbs installed. When I informed her that I will be ending the tenancy next month, she immediately kicked me out without any proper notice, literally sent a WeChat message and excepted me to leave within 1 week. She did not return any deposit or let me use my deposit towards a last months rent. She constantly harassed me and emotionally abused me via WeChat voice messages until I moved my belongings.

Manager would stand outside your apartment to stare at your microscopic deck and windows for perceived violations of aesthetics (i.e. Halloween decorations up, a pirate flag, soil from planting the previous weekend, plant pots that weren't mounted, etc.) 

Although assigned parking, people would park in our spot all the time and managers never helped us.

Geese live by the creek and fly on the roof to honk and nest. 

They keep tearing down trees by the creek, allowing more noise from the factory and traffic across the water. 

The manager tells you it's cool to smoke by the creek or off the property but several neighbors received a fine when spotted. 

24hr entry notices for maintenance really meant ""sometime this month"". Once, a Verizon tech was in the apartment unexpectedly, without a mask during the pandemic. When I asked him to leave because I didn't receive proper notice, nor did I request service, I was threatened with eviction.

Then the owners thought they should install new windows and siding without giving clear information about the procedure and what to expect. Workers played loud music and left supplies and equipment in common areas where people walk and get into their cars. New siding is ugly; we enjoyed the ochre color but now it's boring gray.

Overall, the experience was terrible and when they raised the rent 9.75% (just below the 9.9% limit that requires landlords to pay for relocation costs), we were out of there. We never once missed rent during the pandemic, as we have essential jobs.

Also, they are now Exaris Properties but used to go by the name BDN Properties. The property manager for this rental is terrible. Sometimes he's on the ball with stuff and has sent maintenance out right away with no ticket, but sometimes repairs never get done no matter how many times you report it over the years. This is not just minor repairs either, I'm referring to holes in the ceiling. Often requests are just closed with no communication, and you're not always notified by email; there's a backdoor someone can use to just delete the request out of your tenant portal forcing you to submit a new one. Even with communication directly to the property manager this continues to happen

Our central heating unit has broken multiple times over the past 2 years despite working fine the first 3 years we were here. We were left with no heat in the middle of January over a weekend, after being told they could get it fixed over the weekend; also not the first time a repeated problem was promised to be repaired once and for all and maintenance simply did not show up.

I have asked them to spray for bugs outside the perimeter of the house because we've had a repeated bug problem especially in the summer since living here. They sprayed the inside once, and it didn't help, so I haven't asked them to do the inside again. The requests have been ignored and closed with no acknowledgement. I've taken the issue into my own hands and put glue traps around the problem areas, and spray the outside with raid

I have had maintenance enter the house after knocking, and almost walked in on someone showering. I tried to discuss this situation to make sure this didn't happen again. He said ""The tech was in the area and wanted to pop in to get it done"" No guarantee was given that this wouldn't happen in the future, and I'm not even sure that is legal

She hooks you with seemingly low rent but the house is unfinished, dirty, and (before I taped up the rotten, rusted plumbing fixtures) it was crawling with sewer roaches and crickets. I left the room cleaner and in better repair than when I moved in and she still charged me cleaning fees. She also charged me for a smoke detector. But there was never a smoke detector when I moved in. She ignored my emails about these fees. I was late on rent and she took it personally. It was incredibly unprofessional and I ended up leaving the property early on the mutual agreement that I would be out by the end of the month and she would not evict me or charge me any additional fees. I'm glad I left because it sounds like she gave the other tenants only a month to find other accommodations because she intends to sell the house. You can hear every breath and sigh and cough and fart and moan through the vents. It is not a proper space for adult housemates. The kitchen odors exhaust throughout the house too so expect your bedding and clothing to reek of cooking oil. The floors were unfinished. Her maintenence crew left ladders and construction trash and supplies in big, ugly piles all over the yard. The showers are poorly built so the water pools in a corner and leaks into the foundation. I could go on. That house needs a ton of work. I hope whoever buys it hires a competent inspector so they know what they're in for. The day I moved out, Carmelita decided I had to be out by 9am. Nowhere in the lease does it say this and the remaining tenants were fine with me finishing packing and leaving in the evening. I was waiting for the moving truck. The lease said keys must be returned at 9am, which we did. She made me leave the house without my things and coordinate with the other housemates to return in the evening, despite us already having coordinated, and despite me planning to have a couple more hours to pack. I understand late payments are troubling to landlords but it isn't personal. She made statements about my character and accused me of lying when I was extremely communicative the entire time. All of that was unnecessary and unprofessional. Carmelita doesn't think of these rooms and houses as your home. She thinks of renters as revenue streams to exploit and belittle and that's it. She constantly made emotional statements rthat made me feel unwelcome in my own home. That's completely uncalled for and quite nasty. I'm sure she'll sell this place for a lot of money and retire very well off. I hope her existing tenants found safe, clean, affordable housing with a respectful landlord.
